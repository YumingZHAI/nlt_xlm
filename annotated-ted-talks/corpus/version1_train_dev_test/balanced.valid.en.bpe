and , listen , everyone 's ent@@ it@@ led to their opinion ; they 're even ent@@ it@@ led to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you 're not ent@@ it@@ led to ?
you 're not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . sorry , you 're not .
and i was amaz@@ ed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effec@@ tive public health me@@ asure in human history .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i could n't understand why people thought this was `@@ ` franken@@ fo@@ ods , '@@ ' why they thought moving molec@@ ules around in a specif@@ ic , rather than a ha@@ pha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature 's ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
and that 's because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were driving me crazy were n't actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
they were though@@ t@@ ful people , educat@@ ed people , dec@@ ent people .
we 're at a point in this world where we do n't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic ter@@ ms with little qu@@ otes around it : `@@ ` progress . '@@ '
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we should n't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be ske@@ p@@ tical .
but here 's the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
about 12 years ago , there was a story publ@@ ished , a horrible story , that lin@@ ked the epi@@ demi@@ c of au@@ tis@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , mum@@ ps and rub@@ ella vac@@ cine shot .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
dis@@ astro@@ us because here 's a fact : the united states is one of the only coun@@ tries in the world where the vac@@ cine rate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have me@@ as@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of me@@ as@@ les ?
does n't happen very much .
that 's a lot of death of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it did n't happen here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like jenny mccar@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from platform@@ s like `@@ ` o@@ pr@@ ah '@@ ' and `@@ ` larry king live . '@@ '
and they can do it because they do n't link caus@@ ation and cor@@ relation .
they do n't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
he took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . pol@@ io -- pu@@ ff , gone .
he just develop@@ ed a rot@@ av@@ irus vac@@ cine with a bunch of other people .
well , it 's good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
when paul spe@@ aks in a public hearing , he ca n't test@@ if@@ y without ar@@ med guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
we have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
today , i do n't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he 's flying to la@@ x , right now he 's over ohio .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to long beach , and he 's going to atten@@ d one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infec@@ ted with a par@@ aly@@ tic disease , and we do n't either because that 's the way the world works .
that 's the planet we live on . do n't pretend it is n't .
now , we love to wrap our@@ selves in lies . we love to do it .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it does n't matter how often we find out that they 're us@@ eless .
the data says it all the time .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we do n't trust the man .
and we should n't : our health care system su@@ cks .
it 's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and soul@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ ford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we le@@ ap into the arms of big pl@@ ace@@ bo .
that 's fantast@@ ic . i love big pl@@ ace@@ bo .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend bil@@ lions of dollars on it .
and i have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , frau@@ d ; ech@@ in@@ acea , frau@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i do n't even know what that is but we 're spen@@ ding bil@@ lions of dollars on it -- it 's frau@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , `@@ ` what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . '@@ '
because i do n't care if it 's the secre@@ tary of h@@ hs who 's saying , `@@ ` h@@ mm , i 'm not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on mam@@ mo@@ gram@@ s , '@@ ' or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you do n't want to be .
he killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by insist@@ ing that bee@@ tro@@ ot , gar@@ li@@ c and lem@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drug@@ s we know can slow the course of aids .
please , do n't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epi@@ demi@@ c we 're in the middle of right now is this absur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food and the organ@@ ic elite .
every single thing we eat , every gr@@ ain of rice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sley , every brus@@ sels s@@ pro@@ ut has been modi@@ fied by man .
there were n't christmas trees . we made it all .
and some of it worked , and some of it did n't .
we got rid of the stuff that did n't .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vit@@ amin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prol@@ ong their lives .
i have to say , i do n't understand it .
we object to genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
well , the things i constant@@ ly hear are : too many chem@@ ic@@ als , pest@@ ici@@ des , hormon@@ es , mon@@ ocul@@ ture , we do n't want giant fields of the same thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't compan@@ ies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
we do n't want compan@@ ies ow@@ ning se@@ eds .
it 's true , we 've got a huge food problem , but this is n't science .
it 's law , it 's mor@@ ality , it 's pat@@ ent stuff .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very de@@ aden@@ ing , and it 's pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from prosper@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 per@@ cent more food than we do right now , 70 per@@ cent .
this invest@@ ment in africa over the last 30 years .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
and why ? genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
we do n't want to encour@@ age people to eat that rotten stuff , like cas@@ sav@@ a for in@@ stance .
cas@@ sav@@ a 's something that half a bil@@ lion people eat .
it 's kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o .
it does n't have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it does n't have protein , and scienti@@ sts are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
i mean , let 's ask our@@ selves : why are we fighting it ?
this is n't about rice kr@@ is@@ pies , this is about keeping people alive , and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant .
if we do n't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that i do n't think we want to be guilty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's sel@@ fish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , `@@ ` so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? '@@ '
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
