and , listen , everyone 's entitled to their opinion ; they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you 're not entitled to ?
you 're not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you 're not .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
about a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . a little story .
and I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I did n't know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
and soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so I wrote a story about that too , and I could n't understand why people thought this was `` frankenfoods , '' why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature 's ground .
but , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I 'm a journalist .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it 's fine .
but these stories bothered me , and I could n't figure out why , and eventually I did .
and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy were n't actually fanatics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just disturbed me so much .
but then I thought , you know , let 's be honest .
we 're at a point in this world where we do n't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambivalently .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : `` progress . ''
okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we should n't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
do n't take anything for granted .
but here 's the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
and the reason that I can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one I 've never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous because here 's a fact : the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it 's horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
does n't happen very much .
does n't happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
that 's a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
but since it did n't happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like `` oprah '' and `` larry King Live . ''
and they can do it because they do n't link causation and correlation .
they do n't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no agony . polio -- puff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is Paul Offit .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it 'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it 's good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , Paul 's a terrorist .
when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he ca n't testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because Paul made a vaccine .
I do n't need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that 's happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it 's getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it 's just a numbers game .
and they 're not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let 's have that . why not ?
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident .
no one 's ever said that before .
she was n't going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we do n't have polio . and you know what ?
we did n't have polio in this country yesterday .
today , I do n't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he 's flying to LAX , right now he 's over Ohio .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to Long Beach , and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease , and we do n't either because that 's the way the world works .
that 's the planet we live on . do n't pretend it is n't .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it does n't matter how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data says it all the time .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
it 's okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
I 'm totally with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma .
we hate Big Government . we do n't trust the Man .
and we should n't : our health care system sucks .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of Big Placebo .
that 's fantastic . I love Big Placebo .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and I have all sorts of little props here .
none of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai -- I do n't even know what that is but we 're spending billions of dollars on it -- it 's fraud .
and you know what ? when I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , `` what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because I do n't care if it 's the secretary of HHS who 's saying , `` hmm , I 'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , '' or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you do n't want to be .
you end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
please , do n't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mindless epidemic we 're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
it 's an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
it 's ideology , it 's not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sprig of parsley , every Brussels sprout has been modified by man .
you know , there were n't tangerines in the garden of Eden .
there was n't any cantaloupe .
there were n't Christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it did n't .
we got rid of the stuff that did n't .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
you do n't want to do that ?
I have to say , I do n't understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things I constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we do n't want giant fields of the same thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't companies patenting life .
we do n't want companies owning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you 're right . let 's fix it .
it 's true , we 've got a huge food problem , but this is n't science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it 's law , it 's morality , it 's patent stuff .
you know science is n't a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very deadening , and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
cassava 's something that half a billion people eat .
it 's kind of like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it does n't have nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
they would n't starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice .
and all I can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let 's ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we do n't want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
this is n't about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we do n't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that I do n't think we want to be guilty of : high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , `` so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? ''
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
it 's stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
