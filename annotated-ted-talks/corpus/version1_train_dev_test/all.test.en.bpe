we can move it where we want to move it , and we 're going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we 're going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , that 's something the world needs right now .
everybody tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' in the title publ@@ ished in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among rese@@ arch@@ ers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in sp@@ ite of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cogn@@ itive trap@@ s that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cogn@@ itive trap@@ s .
this app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we 're just as mes@@ sed up as any@@ body else is .
the first of these trap@@ s is a reluc@@ tan@@ ce to admit comple@@ x@@ ity .
it turns out that the word `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' is just not a use@@ ful word anymore , because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restr@@ ict it , but by and large , this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adop@@ t the more complic@@ ated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; bas@@ ically , it 's between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they 're both lum@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the fo@@ cus@@ ing il@@ lusion , and it 's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we ca n't think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive trap .
there 's just no way of getting it right .
now , i 'd like to start with an ex@@ ample of somebody who had a question@@ -@@ and-@@ answer session after one of my lectu@@ res repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he 'd been listening to a symph@@ ony , and it was absolutely glor@@ ious music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it had n't .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glor@@ ious music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
there is an experien@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but bas@@ ically it has only the present .
it 's the experien@@ cing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , `@@ ` does it hurt now when i touch you here ? '@@ '
and then there is a remember@@ ing self , and the remember@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ eps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it 's the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , `@@ ` how have you been feeling lat@@ ely ? '@@ '
or `@@ ` how was your trip to albania ? '@@ ' or something like that .
those are two very different ent@@ ities , the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remember@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one ex@@ ample .
this is an old study .
those are actual pati@@ ents under@@ going a pain@@ ful procedure .
i wo n't go into detail . it 's no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two pati@@ ents , those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , `@@ ` who of them suff@@ ered more ? '@@ '
and it 's a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : `@@ ` how much did these pati@@ ents think they suff@@ ered ? '@@ '
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than patient b .
the stories of the colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es were different , and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distinc@@ t ...
but one of them is distinc@@ tly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , `@@ ` how bad was the whole thing , in total ? '@@ '
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct confl@@ ict between the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually exten@@ d the colon@@ os@@ copy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experien@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remember@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endo@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , signific@@ ant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
now , the experien@@ cing self lives its life contin@@ uo@@ usly .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 -- most of them do n't leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remember@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it 's the fin@@ ite re@@ source that we 're spen@@ ding while we 're on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remember@@ ing self ke@@ eps for us .
so we have the remember@@ ing self and the experien@@ cing self , and they 're really quite distinc@@ t .
the big@@ gest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
that 's not the way it works at all for the remember@@ ing self .
for the remember@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is barely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the crit@@ ical variable that distingu@@ ishes a remember@@ ing self from an experien@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remember@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ oses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that 's the sur@@ geon that will be chosen .
the experien@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually do n't choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we do n't think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticip@@ ated memories .
and bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a tyr@@ anny of the remember@@ ing self , and you can think of the remember@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experien@@ cing self through experiences that the experien@@ cing self does n't need .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remember@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to justif@@ y i think .
i mean , how much do we consum@@ e our memories ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remember@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i 've ever had , and i think of it relativ@@ ely often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memories of that thre@@ e-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discre@@ pan@@ cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little ap@@ petite i have for consum@@ ing memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought exper@@ iment .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destroy@@ ed , and you 'll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you wo n't remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a confl@@ ict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adju@@ dic@@ ate that confl@@ ict , and it 's actually not at all obvious , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in ter@@ ms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can ap@@ ply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experien@@ cing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experien@@ cing self 's life ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a fair@@ ly complic@@ ated process .
what are the emotions that can be me@@ asu@@ red ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experien@@ cing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remember@@ ing self , it 's a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who does n't distingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who 've been mes@@ sing up the study of happiness for a long time in precis@@ ely this way .
the distinc@@ tion between the happiness of the experien@@ cing self and the satisfaction of the remember@@ ing self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to me@@ asure the two separ@@ ately .
the gal@@ lu@@ p organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main les@@ son i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really does n't te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they 're living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , `@@ ` oh his father is six feet tall , '@@ ' how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there 's a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experien@@ cing self .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
we know something about what control@@ s satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satisfied with people that we like , spen@@ ding time with people that we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant .
so if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we can not think straight about happiness is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in clim@@ ate .
well , it turns out that clim@@ ate is not very important to the experien@@ cing self and it 's not even very important to the reflec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the reflec@@ tive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experien@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you . i 've got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that gal@@ lu@@ p sur@@ vey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel kah@@ nem@@ an : sure .
i think the most interesting res@@ ult that we found in the gal@@ lu@@ p sur@@ vey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experien@@ cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , var@@ y with in@@ come .
and it turns out that , below an in@@ come of 60,000 dollars a year , for americ@@ ans -- and that 's a very large samp@@ le of americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00,000 , so it 's a large represent@@ ative samp@@ le -- below an in@@ come of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
60,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ o@@ rer they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i 've rar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experien@@ ti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can me@@ asure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
in ter@@ ms of the other self , the remember@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but danny , the whole american ende@@ av@@ or is about life , liberty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for ex@@ ample , tax@@ ation polic@@ y and so forth .
is there any chance that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public polic@@ y based on it ?
dk : you know i think that there is recogn@@ ition of the role of happiness research in public polic@@ y .
the recogn@@ ition is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.@@ k. , it is happening , and in other coun@@ tries it is happening .
people are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y .
it 's going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evalu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fair@@ ly soon .
how to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remember@@ ing self or you think of the experien@@ cing self .
this is going to influence polic@@ y , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , efforts are being made to me@@ asure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next de@@ cade or two , part of national statist@@ ics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y discus@@ sion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ oral econom@@ ics .
thank you , danny kah@@ nem@@ an .
