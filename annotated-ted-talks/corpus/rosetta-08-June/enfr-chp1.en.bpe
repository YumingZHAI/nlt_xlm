you do n't know about me , without you have read a book by the name of `@@ ` the advent@@ ures of tom saw@@ yer '@@ ' , but that ai n't no matter . that book was made by mr. mark t@@ wa@@ in , and he told the truth , main@@ ly . there was things which he stretched , but main@@ ly he told the truth . that is nothing . i never seen any@@ body but lied , one time or another , without it was aunt pol@@ ly , or the wid@@ ow , or maybe mary . aunt pol@@ ly -- tom 's aunt pol@@ ly , she is -- and mary , and the wid@@ ow douglas , is all told about in that book -- which is mostly a true book ; with some stret@@ ch@@ ers , as i said before .
now the way that the book win@@ ds up , is this : tom and me found the money that the rob@@ bers hid in the cave , and it made us rich . we got six thousand dollars ap@@ ie@@ ce -- all gold . it was an awful sight of money when it was pil@@ ed up . well , judge that@@ cher , he took it and put it out at interest , and it fet@@ ched us a dollar a day ap@@ ie@@ ce , all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with . the wid@@ ow douglas , she took me for her son , and allowed she would siv@@ ili@@ ze me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dis@@ mal regular and dec@@ ent the wid@@ ow was in all her ways ; and so when i could n't stand it no longer , i lit out . i got into my old rag@@ s , and my su@@ gar@@ -@@ ho@@ gs@@ head again , and was free and satisfied . but tom saw@@ yer , he hun@@ ted me up and said he was going to start a band of rob@@ bers , and i might join if i would go back to the wid@@ ow and be respec@@ table . so i went back .
the wid@@ ow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lam@@ b , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it . she put me in them new clothes again , and i could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cr@@ amp@@ ed up . well , then , the old thing commen@@ ced again . the wid@@ ow rung a bell for su@@ pper , and you had to come to time . when you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the wid@@ ow to tu@@ ck down her head and grum@@ ble a little over the vic@@ tu@@ als , though there war n't really anything the matter with them . that is , nothing only everything was cook@@ ed by itself . in a bar@@ rel of od@@ ds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the ju@@ ice kind of s@@ wap@@ s around , and the things go better .
after su@@ pper she got out her book and learned me about mo@@ ses and the bul@@ rus@@ hers ; and i was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but b@@ y-@@ and-@@ by she let it out that mo@@ ses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then i did n't care no more about him ; because i do n't take no stock in dead people .
pretty soon i wanted to smoke , and asked the wid@@ ow to let me . but she would n't . she said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and i must try to not do it any more . that is just the way with some people . they get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it . here she was a bo@@ thering about mo@@ ses , which was no kin to her , and no use to any@@ body , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it . and she took s@@ nuf@@ f too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .
her sister , miss watson , a toler@@ able sli@@ m old ma@@ id , with gog@@ g@@ les on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now , with a sp@@ ell@@ ing-@@ book . she worked me midd@@ ling hard for about an hour , and then the wid@@ ow made her ease up . i could n't stood it much longer . then for an hour it was dead@@ ly dul@@ l , and i was fid@@ get@@ y . miss watson would say , `@@ ` dont put your feet up there , hu@@ ck@@ le@@ berry ; '@@ ' and `@@ ` dont scr@@ un@@ ch up like that , hu@@ ck@@ le@@ berry set up straight ; '@@ ' and pretty soon she would say , `@@ ` do n't gap and stret@@ ch like that , hu@@ ck@@ le@@ berry why do n't you try to be@@ have ? '@@ ' then she told me all about the bad place , and i said i wished i was there . she got mad , then , but i did n't mean no harm . all i wanted was to go some@@ wh@@ eres ; all i wanted was a change , i war n't particular . she said it was wick@@ ed to say what i said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; <@@ i@@ > she <@@ /@@ i@@ > was going to live so as to go to the good place . well , i could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so i made up my mind i would n't try for it . but i never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good .
now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place . she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever . so i did n't think much of it . but i never said so . i asked her if she rec@@ kon@@ ed tom saw@@ yer would go there , and , she said , not by a considerable sight . i was glad about that , because i wanted him and me to be together .
miss watson she kept pec@@ king at me , and it got ti@@ re@@ some and lon@@ esome . b@@ y-@@ and-@@ by they fet@@ ched the nig@@ gers in and had pr@@ ay@@ ers , and then everybody was off to bed . i went up to my room with a piece of cand@@ le and put it on the table . then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something che@@ er@@ ful , but it war n't no use . i felt so lon@@ esome i most wished i was dead . the stars was shining , and the leaves rust@@ led in the woods ever so mour@@ n@@ ful ; and i heard an ow@@ l , away off , who@@ -@@ who@@ o@@ ing about somebody that was dead , and a w@@ hippo@@ will and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shi@@ vers run over me . then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night gri@@ ev@@ ing . i got so down@@ -@@ hear@@ ted and scared , i did wish i had some company . pretty soon a sp@@ ider went craw@@ ling up my shoulder , and i flipped it off and it lit in the cand@@ le ; and before i could bu@@ dge it was all sh@@ ri@@ vel@@ ed up . i did n't need any@@ body to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fet@@ ch me some bad luck , so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me . i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thre@@ ad to keep wit@@ ches away . but i had n't no confidence . you do that when you 've lost a hor@@ se-@@ sho@@ e that you 've found , instead of na@@ iling it up over the door , but i had n't ever heard any@@ body say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a sp@@ ider .
i set down again , a shaking all over , and got out my p@@ ipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death , now , and so the wid@@ ow would n't know . well , after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve l@@ icks -- and all still again -- st@@ iller than ever . pretty soon i heard a tw@@ ig s@@ nap , down in the dark am@@ ong@@ st the trees -- something was a stir@@ ring . i set still and listened . directly i could just barely hear a <@@ i@@ > `@@ ` me-@@ yo@@ w ! me-@@ yo@@ w ! '@@ ' <@@ /@@ i@@ > down there . that was good ! says i , <@@ i@@ > `@@ ` me-@@ yo@@ w ! me-@@ yo@@ w ! '@@ ' <@@ /@@ i@@ > as soft as i could , and then i put out the light and scramb@@ led out of the window onto the shed . then i slipped down to the ground and cra@@ wled in am@@ ong@@ st the trees , and sure enough there was tom saw@@ yer waiting for me .
