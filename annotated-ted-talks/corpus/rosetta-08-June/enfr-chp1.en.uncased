you do n't know about me , without you have read a book by the name of `` the adventures of tom sawyer '' , but that ai n't no matter . that book was made by mr. mark twain , and he told the truth , mainly . there was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth . that is nothing . i never seen anybody but lied , one time or another , without it was aunt polly , or the widow , or maybe mary . aunt polly -- tom 's aunt polly , she is -- and mary , and the widow douglas , is all told about in that book -- which is mostly a true book ; with some stretchers , as i said before .
now the way that the book winds up , is this : tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich . we got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold . it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up . well , judge thatcher , he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece , all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with . the widow douglas , she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when i could n't stand it no longer , i lit out . i got into my old rags , and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied . but tom sawyer , he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable . so i went back .
the widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it . she put me in them new clothes again , and i could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up . well , then , the old thing commenced again . the widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time . when you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them . that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself . in a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better .
after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers ; and i was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by-and-by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then i did n't care no more about him ; because i do n't take no stock in dead people .
pretty soon i wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me . but she would n't . she said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and i must try to not do it any more . that is just the way with some people . they get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it . here she was a bothering about moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it . and she took snuff too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .
her sister , miss watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now , with a spelling-book . she worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up . i could n't stood it much longer . then for an hour it was deadly dull , and i was fidgety . miss watson would say , `` dont put your feet up there , huckleberry ; '' and `` dont scrunch up like that , huckleberry set up straight ; '' and pretty soon she would say , `` do n't gap and stretch like that , huckleberry why do n't you try to behave ? '' then she told me all about the bad place , and i said i wished i was there . she got mad , then , but i did n't mean no harm . all i wanted was to go somewheres ; all i wanted was a change , i war n't particular . she said it was wicked to say what i said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; <i> she </i> was going to live so as to go to the good place . well , i could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so i made up my mind i would n't try for it . but i never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good .
now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place . she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever . so i did n't think much of it . but i never said so . i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there , and , she said , not by a considerable sight . i was glad about that , because i wanted him and me to be together .
miss watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome . by-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed . i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table . then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use . i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead . the stars was shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and i heard an owl , away off , who-whooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me . then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving . i got so down-hearted and scared , i did wish i had some company . pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before i could budge it was all shriveled up . i did n't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me . i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away . but i had n't no confidence . you do that when you 've lost a horse-shoe that you 've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but i had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider .
i set down again , a shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death , now , and so the widow would n't know . well , after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks -- and all still again -- stiller than ever . pretty soon i heard a twig snap , down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring . i set still and listened . directly i could just barely hear a <i> `` me-yow ! me-yow ! '' </i> down there . that was good ! says i , <i> `` me-yow ! me-yow ! '' </i> as soft as i could , and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window onto the shed . then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in amongst the trees , and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me .
