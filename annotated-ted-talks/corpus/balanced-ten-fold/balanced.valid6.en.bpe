what could be more lonely than to be envel@@ oped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wis@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and i know there 's some of you who say , `@@ ` well , would n't it be better , would n't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? '@@ ' and i say , `@@ ` great , let 's make that language yor@@ uba . let 's make it cant@@ on@@ ese .
in 1957 , five mission@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a crit@@ ical mistake .
they spe@@ ared each other .
in the early '@@ 80@@ s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ filtr@@ ating the secret soci@@ eti@@ es which were the foundation of du@@ vali@@ er 's strength and ton@@ ton mac@@ ou@@ tes , and secur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make zom@@ bies .
to this day , they remain rul@@ ed by a ritu@@ al pri@@ est@@ hood but the training for the pri@@ est@@ hood is rather extraordin@@ ary .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that crystal moment of a@@ waren@@ ess of first light as the sun beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ ning@@ ly beautiful lands@@ cape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning glory . and the priest steps back and says , `@@ ` you see ? it 's really as i 've told you .
whether it 's the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relev@@ ant .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the kw@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forest@@ s were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ w@@ hu@@ kw and the cro@@ ok@@ ed be@@ ak of heaven and the can@@ n@@ ibal spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
what makes ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca fascin@@ ating is not the she@@ er pharmac@@ ological potential of this preparation , but the elabor@@ ation of it . it 's made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ ody li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue haz@@ y smoke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it 's mixed with the leaves of a shr@@ ub in the coffee family called psych@@ otr@@ ia vir@@ idi@@ s .
i mean , do n't you know anything ? '@@ ' and i said , `@@ ` no . '@@ '
now , that 's not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
someone who did n't have a chil@@ d@@ hood is out there .
and if you want the ultimate in pl@@ ace@@ bo , you 've go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ ring@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inj@@ ect this into a patient ...
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibil@@ ities to try .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
i encour@@ age all of you to read steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely was instrum@@ ental -- if you 'll par@@ don the p@@ un -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ ano@@ id , distur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ ud@@ ite , brilli@@ ant , ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ train@@ ed music@@ ian .
what i 'm going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some found@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ quisition almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , and it 's an environ@@ ment in which you can either local@@ ly or remo@@ tely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amo@@ un@@ ts of visual data .
but the spati@@ al arrang@@ ement of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
and that gets really excit@@ ing when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ antic information that a lot of those images have .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ co@@ plasma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the smal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the labor@@ atory , and we 've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller gen@@ ome .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
we design unique elements into this .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dramat@@ ically .
then of course , there 's all that co@@ 2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
and it 's just standard selection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fu@@ el production , vac@@ cine production , etc. .
we 're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co@@ 2 , which can easily be pip@@ ed to sites , conver@@ t that co@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to drive this process .
you 've seen this year with f@@ lu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vac@@ cine .
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the arc@@ tic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shr@@ unk by 40 per@@ cent .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tica the larg@@ est mass of ice on the planet .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
and the dis@@ aster@@ s around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extraordin@@ ary and un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed rate .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us , but i 'd just gotten past `@@ ` mang@@ led , '@@ ' and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collec@@ t myself from the emo@@ tional shock and impact that the as@@ sault from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i was n't using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then .
by casu@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and casting shadows on their power .
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p 's part to get me to do the exerc@@ ises i did n't want to do before the prosp@@ ect of being the rich@@ est f@@ iv@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old in the second floor ward , but what he effec@@ tively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily occur@@ rence into a new and prom@@ ising experience for me .
by not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not acknow@@ led@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of whatever natural strugg@@ le they might have .
and , perhaps , until we 're test@@ ed , we do n't know what we 're made of .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
they were simply told , `@@ ` these are the ` a-@@ students , ' these are the ' d - students . ' '@@ ' and that 's how they went about te@@ aching them and tre@@ ating them .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
it 's only possible to see that in@@ sight when you step back and look at all of them .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win@@ ners .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specif@@ ic section .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more `@@ ` ta-@@ da '@@ ' structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
if you put you put an execu@@ tive ad@@ min . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
you know , gen@@ oci@@ de , the physical extinc@@ tion of a people is univer@@ sally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it 's univer@@ sally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strateg@@ y .
and you can not understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
and it 's hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for -@@ ls@@ b@@ - 15@@ 0,000 -@@ r@@ sb@@ - years .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
an amazing ex@@ ample of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek rest@@ itu@@ tion with its people .
i 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that i hope will reson@@ ate with other things you 've already heard , and i 'll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you miss them .
and the official dog@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ fare of our cit@@ iz@@ ens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
here 's an ex@@ ample . for those of you who are n't new yor@@ kers , i apologi@@ ze .
and those other things may have lots of attr@@ active features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attr@@ active .
this hit me when i went to re@@ place my jeans .
and the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ eper said , `@@ ` do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the best@@ -@@ fit@@ ting jeans i had ever had .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions avail@@ able , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
no@@ wad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industri@@ aliz@@ ed cit@@ iz@@ ens , with perfec@@ tion the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
now , as a polic@@ y matter -- i 'm almost done -- as a polic@@ y matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial soci@@ eti@@ es is material afflu@@ ence .
i asked the top scienti@@ sts on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
the world today has 6.@@ 8 bil@@ lion people .
if you burn co@@ al , no .
now , i thought , `@@ ` how could i really capture this ?
if you 're coun@@ ting on it for 100 per@@ cent , you need an incredi@@ ble miracle batter@@ y .
well , we need lots of compan@@ ies working on this , hund@@ reds .
so , you know , it 's got lots of challen@@ ges ahead , but it is an ex@@ ample of the many hund@@ reds and hund@@ reds of ideas that we need to move forward .
if we do n't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor coun@@ tries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two bil@@ lion will be far worse .
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
they should discus@@ s this innov@@ ation ag@@ enda , and you 'd be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low level@@ s of spen@@ ding on these innov@@ ative appro@@ aches .
bg : that 's right . today , you 're always refu@@ eling the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of control@@ s that can go wrong : that thing where you 're opening it up and moving things in and out , that 's not good .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
bg : if you get into that situation , it 's like if you 've been over@@ -@@ eating , and you 're about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
the fact is it 's that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reason@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that 's non-@@ economic and you 're trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
my gre@@ at-@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
we 're on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hund@@ reds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progress , when we fought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic ter@@ ms with little qu@@ otes around it : `@@ ` progress . '@@ '
the data came back .
we have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
today , i do n't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he 's flying to la@@ x , right now he 's over ohio .
that 's the planet we live on . do n't pretend it is n't .
now , we love to wrap our@@ selves in lies . we love to do it .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend bil@@ lions of dollars on it .
every single thing we eat , every gr@@ ain of rice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sley , every brus@@ sels s@@ pro@@ ut has been modi@@ fied by man .
we object to genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
i mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive trap .
and neither of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distinc@@ t ...
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
it 's the fin@@ ite re@@ source that we 're spen@@ ding while we 're on this earth .
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a fair@@ ly complic@@ ated process .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , `@@ ` oh his father is six feet tall , '@@ ' how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satisfied with people that we like , spen@@ ding time with people that we like .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y discus@@ sion to track over the next few years .
