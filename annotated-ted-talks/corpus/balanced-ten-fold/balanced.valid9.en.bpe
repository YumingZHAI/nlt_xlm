and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ itions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ quest@@ ered in a shado@@ wy world of darkness in stone hut@@ s at the base of glac@@ iers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year perio@@ ds deliber@@ ately chosen to mim@@ ic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother 's wom@@ b ; now they are metap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
it 's a photo@@ graph i took in the north@@ west amazon just last april .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they can not be taken or@@ ally because they 're den@@ at@@ ured by an enz@@ yme found natur@@ ally in the human gut called mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 varie@@ ties of ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
in other words , sugar pil@@ ls have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kin@@ ds of studies , the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmac@@ eut@@ ical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for ex@@ ample , if they believe it enough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i 'm squeez@@ ing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
so , this is a trick that i often te@@ ach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about decep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even though it 's a very simple trick meth@@ od@@ olog@@ ically .
i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmac@@ eut@@ ical -- they 're sugar pil@@ ls .
so , i sug@@ gest if you get que@@ as@@ y easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i 'll do the first bad part behind it .
now , essenti@@ ally we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blo@@ cks .
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building si@@ f@@ tables .
they 're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wi@@ re@@ less radio .
most import@@ antly , they 're physical , so like the blo@@ cks , you can move them just by reaching out and gras@@ ping .
and we wanted to build a learning to@@ ol for language lear@@ ners .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new hum@@ an-@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our br@@ ains and bodies work .
and the source was a man , an afric@@ an-@@ american man , char@@ ming , rug@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
na@@ than@@ iel dropped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of ski@@ d row in down@@ town los angeles .
most of them are ordin@@ ary digital camera photos , but this one , for ex@@ ample , is a s@@ can from the library of congress , and it 's in the 300 meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el range .
and this one i really wo n't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
if somebody bo@@ thered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else 's photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mo@@ dal and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
it 's nothing if not amb@@ iti@@ ous .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
we desig@@ ned the pieces , went through our error correc@@ tion and had a dna molec@@ ule of about 5,000 letters .
trip@@ lets of those letters code for roug@@ h@@ ly 20 amino ac@@ ids , such that there 's a single letter design@@ ation for each of the amino ac@@ ids .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abun@@ dance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we 're trying to cre@@ ate a process that 's extre@@ mely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of bi@@ ology .
now i 've argu@@ ed , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half bil@@ lion years of evolution .
to put it in con@@ text for myself : i was born in 1946 .
it 's going to be a stret@@ ch to do it for nine .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future .
these flo@@ ws are increas@@ ing very rapid@@ ly .
this is a completely un@@ sust@@ ain@@ able pat@@ tern .
at coal@@ er@@ gy we view clim@@ ate change as a very serious threat to our business .
clean co@@ al -- you 've heard a lot about it .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there 's very little , but it 's always with me .
so , our respon@@ sibil@@ ity is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from adver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability i 've had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be descri@@ bed by those definit@@ ions .
perhaps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serv@@ es to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
to parap@@ hr@@ ase : it 's not the strong@@ est of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intellig@@ ent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
there 's evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 60,000 years ago , carried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ jury , and perhaps it 's because the life experience of surviv@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ st@@ het@@ ics for fles@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i would n't have hesitated for a second .
so the sum@@ mary consist@@ s of just a little syno@@ p@@ sis and an icon to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
and the idea 's pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tal@@ l@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 st@@ icks of sp@@ agh@@ etti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
and then finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ inger@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-@@ da ! -- they ad@@ m@@ ire their work .
and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of sp@@ agh@@ etti , inc. . right ?
if you have 10 teams that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
here 's what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ fy the hidden assum@@ p@@ tions .
it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
and sometimes , a little proto@@ type of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an `@@ ` u@@ h-@@ oh '@@ ' moment to a `@@ ` ta-@@ da '@@ ' moment .
wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disco@@ ver that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capac@@ ity to adap@@ t to : whether it 's the eg@@ regi@@ ous de@@ forest@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to ser@@ vit@@ ude and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the banks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ neo away to the south china sea , where the japan@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw lo@@ gs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yan@@ om@@ ami , it 's the disease ent@@ ities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
the ne@@ olith@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ etr@@ y of the sh@@ aman was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ est@@ hood ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ation sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that does n't do too much .
there is one corner , by the way , that i 'm not going to tell any@@ body about , where the w@@ ifi works .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad dres@@ sing is ? -- it 's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative indu@@ ces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
clin@@ ical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and that might seem a bit surpris@@ ing because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deli@@ ver to help the po@@ o@@ rest two bil@@ lion live better lives .
it 's been constant@@ ly going up .
it 's only various economic changes that have even flat@@ tened it at all , so we have to go from rapid@@ ly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this en@@ com@@ passes everything : the food we eat , clothing , tv , he@@ ating .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we 've gone from 26 bil@@ lion to , at best , maybe 13 bil@@ lion tons , and that just wo n't cut it .
now , when i use the term `@@ ` miracle , '@@ ' i do n't mean something that 's impossible .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ v@@ able scale and un@@ belie@@ v@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there 's many directions people are seek@@ ing , i really only see five that can ach@@ ie@@ ve the big numbers .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 per@@ cent level , but getting up to that full per@@ cent@@ age , that will be very tric@@ ky , and agre@@ eing on where these co@@ 2 quant@@ ities should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-@@ term issue .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and innov@@ ation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas lay@@ ing around is not all that surpris@@ ing .
you can see it 's a log there , often refer@@ red to as a trav@@ eling wave re@@ actor .
so , the other grade is : are we deplo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emission technology , have we deplo@@ yed it in all the develop@@ ed coun@@ tries and we 're in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a vertic@@ al kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fu@@ el , of this sort of spent uran@@ ium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
some people say you should n't even work on the insur@@ ance polic@@ y because it might make you laz@@ y , that you 'll keep eating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to save you .
unless you 're very close and you 're just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it 's going to get very che@@ ap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expen@@ sive .
his sh@@ tic@@ k now is , `@@ ` why is n't the r@@ &@@ d getting more discus@@ sed ? '@@ '
my grand@@ parents pushed that number to 70 .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tras@@ h this globe .
people wrap themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so tightly that you ca n't set them free .
and that 's because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were driving me crazy were n't actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
and they can do it because they do n't link caus@@ ation and cor@@ relation .
well , it 's good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very de@@ aden@@ ing , and it 's pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from prosper@@ ing .
this is n't about rice kr@@ is@@ pies , this is about keeping people alive , and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant .
if we do n't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that i do n't think we want to be guilty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cogn@@ itive trap@@ s .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they 're both lum@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
those are two very different ent@@ ities , the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remember@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remember@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i 've ever had , and i think of it relativ@@ ely often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
so you can ask : how happy is the experien@@ cing self ?
what are the emotions that can be me@@ asu@@ red ?
anyone who does n't distingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who 've been mes@@ sing up the study of happiness for a long time in precis@@ ely this way .
so if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in clim@@ ate .
well , it turns out that clim@@ ate is not very important to the experien@@ cing self and it 's not even very important to the reflec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
i think the most interesting res@@ ult that we found in the gal@@ lu@@ p sur@@ vey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
this is going to be , i think , within the next de@@ cade or two , part of national statist@@ ics .
thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ oral econom@@ ics .
thank you , danny kah@@ nem@@ an .
