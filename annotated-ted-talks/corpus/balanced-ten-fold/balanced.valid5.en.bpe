the eth@@ no@@ sphere is human@@ ity 's great leg@@ acy .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roug@@ h@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the grave the last syl@@ lab@@ les of an ancient tongue .
take , for ex@@ ample , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the north@@ west amazon , the people of the an@@ acon@@ da who believe that myth@@ olog@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sac@@ red s@@ nak@@ es .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the myth@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
they call themselves the `@@ ` el@@ der brothers '@@ ' and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for dest@@ ro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important .
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ s@@ ule is not as good as the need@@ le .
i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
one of the interesting implic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to realize , was that we could use every@@ day gest@@ ures on data , like pour@@ ing a color the way we might pour a liquid .
it 's an op@@ en-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
so , the last ex@@ ample i have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ en@@ cing and live performance to@@ ol that we 've built rec@@ ently , in which si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead , bass and dr@@ ums .
and you can inj@@ ect these sounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ semble into the pat@@ tern that you want .
so let 's have a look .
and we got talking about music , and i got an em@@ ail from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a viol@@ in les@@ son with me .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first les@@ son at walt disney concert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes , he was lost .
and as i played , i understood that there was a pro@@ found change occur@@ ring in na@@ than@@ iel 's eyes .
because music allo@@ ws him to take his thoughts and del@@ us@@ ions and shape them through his imagination and his cre@@ ativ@@ ity , into reality .
robert gu@@ pta : i 'm going to play something that i sh@@ amel@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cel@@ list@@ s .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken near gras@@ si lak@@ es in the canadian roc@@ kies -- all these sho@@ ts were taken . so you see elements here of stab@@ iliz@@ ed sli@@ de-@@ show or panor@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been relat@@ ed spati@@ ally .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environ@@ ment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
there are tens of thous@@ ands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it 's a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 font with no spac@@ ing , it takes 142 pages just to print this gen@@ etic code .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kin@@ ds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thous@@ ands of new traits in a second to that species .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell does n't have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
we 're about to go from six and a half to nine bil@@ lion people over the next 40 years .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramat@@ ic incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
around christmas , in my home in tennessee , a bil@@ lion gal@@ lons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was spil@@ led .
so let 's take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean co@@ al facil@@ ity .
america is in crisis -- the econom@@ y , national security , the clim@@ ate crisis .
you know , of course , this is my rag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ aur@@ us so i 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting prim@@ ary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as relat@@ ed to the other kids and the world around me .
there 's an important difference and distinc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subj@@ ec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al opinion of whether or not i 'm dis@@ ab@@ led .
we are effec@@ tively grad@@ ing someone 's worth to our community .
they did n't view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and val@@ u@@ able .
no pro@@ gno@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of someone 's life .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s brit@@ ain , when they were moving from gram@@ mar scho@@ ols to comprehen@@ sive scho@@ ols .
it 's separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and , of course , the heart@@ breaking , f@@ lip side of this study , is that they took the `@@ ` a students '@@ ' and told them they were `@@ ` d 's . '@@ '
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
so pi@@ vot , this application -- i do n't want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it 's really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
they talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jo@@ c@@ key for power .
what kinder@@ garten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build proto@@ types , succes@@ sive proto@@ types , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build proto@@ types along the way .
design@@ ers recognize this type of collaboration as the es@@ sence of the iter@@ ative process .
who does the very best ?
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right proto@@ type .
we think that polem@@ ics -- -- we think that polem@@ ics are not persu@@ as@@ ive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ fare , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ fare they have .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
that is to say , there were some cho@@ ices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
my jaw dropped , and after i reco@@ vered , i said , `@@ ` i want the kind that used to be the only kind . '@@ '
when they came in 100 flav@@ ors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
the co@@ al revolution fu@@ eled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 190@@ 0s we 've seen a very rapid dec@@ line in the price of electric@@ ity , and that 's why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condit@@ ion@@ ing , we can make modern materi@@ als and do so many things .
it 's very different than saying `@@ ` we 're a twel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truck trying to get under a ten-@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of sque@@ eze under . '@@ '
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
first , we 've got population .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and they actually -- although it 's great they do n't requ@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ ages .
and a lot of them , you 'll look at and say , `@@ ` they 're crazy . '@@ ' that 's good .
these break@@ thro@@ ug@@ hs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can me@@ asure that in ter@@ ms of compan@@ ies , pilot projec@@ ts , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
we need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
we need to have this di@@ alogue be a more ration@@ al , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ alogue , including the steps that the government takes .
thank you . thank you .
the tou@@ gh thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several bil@@ lion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that 's very che@@ ap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to deplo@@ y .
you know , we do n't know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that 's a different approach .
and so , that would be your response to the bjor@@ n lom@@ borg argument , that bas@@ ically if you spend all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the co@@ 2 problem , it 's going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to rid the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and malaria and so forth , it 's a stupid waste of the earth 's re@@ sources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual spen@@ ding on the r@@ &@@ d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 bil@@ lion a year more than it is right now -- it 's not that dramat@@ ic .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fest@@ yle .
i think we can power this world with energy that does n't also destroy it .
and i was amaz@@ ed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effec@@ tive public health me@@ asure in human history .
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
that 's a lot of death of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it did n't happen here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like jenny mccar@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from platform@@ s like `@@ ` o@@ pr@@ ah '@@ ' and `@@ ` larry king live . '@@ '
and we should n't : our health care system su@@ cks .
we le@@ ap into the arms of big pl@@ ace@@ bo .
and i have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epi@@ demi@@ c we 're in the middle of right now is this absur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food and the organ@@ ic elite .
we do n't want to encour@@ age people to eat that rotten stuff , like cas@@ sav@@ a for in@@ stance .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we 're going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we 're going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , that 's something the world needs right now .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restr@@ ict it , but by and large , this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adop@@ t the more complic@@ ated view of what well-@@ being is .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
it 's the experien@@ cing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , `@@ ` does it hurt now when i touch you here ? '@@ '
and then there is a remember@@ ing self , and the remember@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ eps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it 's the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , `@@ ` how have you been feeling lat@@ ely ? '@@ '
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than patient b .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually exten@@ d the colon@@ os@@ copy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
so we have the remember@@ ing self and the experien@@ cing self , and they 're really quite distinc@@ t .
we actually do n't choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we do n't think of our future normally as experiences .
there seems to be a discre@@ pan@@ cy .
we know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
when we looked at how feelings , var@@ y with in@@ come .
i mean i 've rar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for ex@@ ample , tax@@ ation polic@@ y and so forth .
it 's going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evalu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fair@@ ly soon .
