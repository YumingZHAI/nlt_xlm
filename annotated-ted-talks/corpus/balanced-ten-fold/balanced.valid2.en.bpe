we 're all born . we all bring our children into the world .
no bi@@ ologi@@ sts , for ex@@ ample , would dare sug@@ gest that 50 per@@ cent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinc@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ calyp@@ tic scenario in the real@@ m of bi@@ ological diver@@ sity -- scar@@ cel@@ y appro@@ aches what we know to be the most opti@@ mist@@ ic scenario in the real@@ m of cultural diver@@ sity .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
there 's always one continent left out , the assum@@ ption being that sub-@@ sah@@ aran africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ doo is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic di@@ as@@ pora of the sla@@ very era .
and because you are posses@@ sed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that i 've ever been with , the most extraordin@@ ary are the ko@@ gi of the sierra nevada de santa mar@@ ta in northern colombia .
this is ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active preparation of the sh@@ aman 's repertoire .
it does n't cre@@ ate the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
it turns out that if you administ@@ er a pl@@ ace@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that 's like aspir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it 's just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect .
but you ca n't count my fingers right now can you ?
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
spati@@ al reason@@ ing is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i til@@ t it in one direction , it 'll roll the video this way ; if i til@@ t it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
so in this case , we 've got three si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint buck@@ ets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
there are also some ne@@ at possibil@@ ities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the resul@@ ts immediately .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibil@@ ities that we 're working to bring out of the labor@@ atory .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel refus@@ es treat@@ ment because when he was treated it was with shock therap@@ y and thor@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
it does n't make any difference because the only thing that ou@@ ght to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flex@@ ible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an ex@@ ample of non-@@ image data .
to prove to you that it 's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it 's not a picture .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a new@@ sp@@ aper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
this is a re@@ construction of notre dame cathedr@@ al that was done entirely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images scrap@@ ed from flick@@ r . you just type notre dame into flick@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es re@@ presents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
its job is to re@@ cre@@ ate the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ lion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
i do n't know whether this got the big@@ gest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
can chem@@ ist@@ ry per@@ mit making these really large molec@@ ules where we 've never been before ?
our ability to write the gen@@ etic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increas@@ ing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an expon@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve .
the excit@@ ing phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bac@@ teria , and the bac@@ teria started to read this gen@@ etic code , made the vir@@ al partic@@ les .
here 's an ex@@ ample of it : there 's an organis@@ m called de@@ ino@@ coc@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions rad@@ s of radi@@ ation .
it 's such a large molec@@ ule we can see it with a light micro@@ scope .
with bac@@ teria and archa@@ ea , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we rec@@ ently showed that we can do a complete tran@@ sp@@ lant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
all the protein@@ s changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the gen@@ etic code , it 's exactly what we had transfer@@ red in .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid metho@@ ds of synth@@ esis , to do what we 're calling combin@@ at@@ orial genom@@ ics .
but the only way we think that bi@@ ology can have a major impact without further increas@@ ing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ stock , and so we 're working with desig@@ ning cell@@ s to go down this road .
it takes co@@ 2 to meth@@ ane using molec@@ ular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
compar@@ ed to the total amount of global war@@ ming pollu@@ tion in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxy@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .

i had to do what seemed like in@@ numer@@ able repet@@ itions of exerc@@ ises with these thick , elast@@ ic bands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ gno@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ gno@@ sis on the expected qu@@ ality of their life , we have to make sure that we do n't put the first brick in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
so , we can give our@@ selves a gift .
if we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ ie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibil@@ ity -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ ities with the community .
well , they took , over a thre@@ e-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a 's , told them they were `@@ ` a 's , '@@ ' told them they were bright , and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
and if you dr@@ ill into that , it 's especially the case for men .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , `@@ ` well , what about taking a look at all of cyc@@ ling ? '@@ '
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sl@@ ice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic searching , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vot .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
it demand@@ s that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we ap@@ ply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
well , the truth is the 20@@ th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its techn@@ ological innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either acti@@ vely en@@ dor@@ sed or passi@@ vely accepted the massive destruction of both bi@@ ological and cultural diver@@ sity on the planet . now , the problem is n't change .
i once trav@@ el@@ led 6,000 miles from cheng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern tibet to l@@ hasa with a young colle@@ ague , and it was only when i got to l@@ hasa that i understood the face behind the statist@@ ics you hear about : 6,000 sac@@ red monuments tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es , 1.2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the cultural revolution .
he was s@@ mug@@ g@@ led into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt ta@@ ils because she could n't bear to be without him .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
this is a photo@@ graph i took at the northern tip of baf@@ fin island when i went nar@@ w@@ hal hun@@ ting with some inu@@ it people , and this man , olay@@ uk , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
and the doc says , `@@ ` but i 'm not you . '@@ '
why do they market to us if we ca n't buy them ?
and it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less dil@@ ig@@ ent .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
a colle@@ ague of mine got access to invest@@ ment records from vangu@@ ard , the gig@@ antic mut@@ ual fund company of about a million emplo@@ ye@@ es and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
by not particip@@ ating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one flav@@ or .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
with a hundred different kin@@ ds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for fail@@ ure .
the clim@@ ate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps wo n't grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile environ@@ ment simply ca n't support .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to redu@@ ce po@@ ver@@ ty , by far you would pick energy .
and there 's certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effec@@ ts will be , but they will be extre@@ mely bad .
so let 's look at this four@@ th factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co@@ 2 put out per each unit of energy .
i decided that rele@@ asing fi@@ ref@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environ@@ ment here this year .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ ew@@ able sources .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it 's a great thing .
this is the lef@@ to@@ ver , the 99 per@@ cent , where they 've taken out the part they burn now , so it 's called dep@@ let@@ ed uran@@ ium .
that 's a key element of making that report card .
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hire all the great scienti@@ sts , which we 've done , that 's only tens of millions , and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a rus@@ sian re@@ actor to make sure that our materi@@ als work proper@@ ly , then you 'll only be up in the hund@@ reds of millions .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exist@@ s today , that 's sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that 's our fu@@ el to begin with .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropri@@ ate .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
we 're at a point in this world where we do n't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
he just develop@@ ed a rot@@ av@@ irus vac@@ cine with a bunch of other people .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , frau@@ d ; ech@@ in@@ acea , frau@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i do n't even know what that is but we 're spen@@ ding bil@@ lions of dollars on it -- it 's frau@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , `@@ ` what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
please , do n't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
i have to say , i do n't understand it .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's sel@@ fish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , `@@ ` so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? '@@ '
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among rese@@ arch@@ ers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
but it had n't .
those are actual pati@@ ents under@@ going a pain@@ ful procedure .
and you are asked , `@@ ` who of them suff@@ ered more ? '@@ '
but now there is another question : `@@ ` how much did these pati@@ ents think they suff@@ ered ? '@@ '
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
most of them are completely ignored by the remember@@ ing self .
that 's not the way it works at all for the remember@@ ing self .
and in this way , time is actually the crit@@ ical variable that distingu@@ ishes a remember@@ ing self from an experien@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
if you ask for the happiness of the remember@@ ing self , it 's a completely different thing .
the gal@@ lu@@ p organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
we know that .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experien@@ ti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can me@@ asure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
