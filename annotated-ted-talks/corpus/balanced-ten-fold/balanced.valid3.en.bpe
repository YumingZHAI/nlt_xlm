just to know that jagu@@ ar sham@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the inu@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the dhar@@ ma , is to really remember the central revel@@ ation of anthro@@ pol@@ ogy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our line@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succes@@ s@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago .
and the great indicat@@ or of that , of course , is language loss .
and so , what i 'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , this is a people who cog@@ nit@@ iv@@ ely do not distingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people depend .
whenever we think of indigen@@ ous people and lands@@ cape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke rous@@ seau and the old can@@ ard of the `@@ ` noble sav@@ age , '@@ ' which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ plic@@ ity , or alternat@@ iv@@ ely , we in@@ vo@@ ke tho@@ reau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could cre@@ ate different re@@ alit@@ ies , you could begin to understand some of their extraordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rif@@ le bar@@ rel lined with bar@@ oque pain@@ t@@ ings and landing on a sea of electric@@ ity .
well , what does that mean ?
something f@@ ake be@@ comes something real because of someone 's percep@@ tion of it .
i 'll get my sle@@ eve back .
i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
and we could talk about why this is decep@@ tive , why you do n't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it proces@@ ses information , it does n't count , one , two , three . it group@@ s them .
what ? that really flipped me out .
and none of it has any real pharmac@@ eut@@ ical qu@@ ality , it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ inch hat@@ pin . it 's very , very sharp , and i 'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
and the people in the back go , `@@ ` ok , i did n't really see that . '@@ '
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , `@@ ` well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mas@@ h-@@ up between scr@@ ab@@ ble and bog@@ g@@ le .
we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence si@@ f@@ tables , ar@@ range them into a series , exten@@ d it , add a little more lead .
so i do n't have to plan it out in advan@@ ce , but i can im@@ pro@@ vise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we 're on the cus@@ p of this new generation of to@@ ols for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ ms .
and i 'm telling a story that many of you know , because steve 's colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert dow@@ ney jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie fo@@ xx as na@@ than@@ iel anthony ay@@ ers , the ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ train@@ ed double bas@@ s@@ ist whose prom@@ ising career was cut short by a trag@@ ic af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ ano@@ id sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vial and greg@@ ari@@ ous way about yo-@@ yo ma and hil@@ lar@@ y clinton and how the dod@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ erous first viol@@ in passage work in the last movement of beethoven 's four@@ th symph@@ ony .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmac@@ eut@@ ical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
this is actually a po@@ ster of notre dame that regi@@ ster@@ ed correc@@ tly .
now of course , in a way those accid@@ ents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refu@@ te .
so , our pace of digit@@ iz@@ ing life has been increas@@ ing at an expon@@ enti@@ al pace .
the vir@@ al partic@@ les then were released from the cell@@ s and came back and killed the e. coli .
we actually found , on rese@@ qu@@ en@@ cing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that original sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be boot@@ ed up .
part of the design is desig@@ ning pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ lap with all the other 50-@@ letter pieces to build smaller su@@ bun@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we desig@@ ned these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes ; there are enz@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
we 're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
it 's also sim@@ pler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like our@@ selves : you can just pop out the nucle@@ us and pop in another one , and that 's what you 've all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kin@@ ds of other metho@@ ds .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the basic question is of `@@ ` what is life ? '@@ '
but also , we 're now working on using these same to@@ ols to come up with instant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enor@@ mous heat sink he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an ann@@ ual mel@@ ting river .
if you want to know how sea level r@@ ises from land-@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
this , all over the country , is the second larg@@ est waste stream in america .
fro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a jol@@ ly , happy soul .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our ad@@ diction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dirty co@@ al and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
re@@ power america with 100 per@@ cent clean electric@@ ity within 10 years .
finally , a solution that 's big enough to sol@@ ve our problems .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth no@@ ting .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest as@@ set .
implic@@ it in this phrase of `@@ ` over@@ coming adver@@ sity '@@ ' is the idea that succes@@ s , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience un@@ s@@ ca@@ thed or un@@ marked by the experience , as if my succes@@ ses in life have come about from an ability to side@@ step or circum@@ navig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ st@@ het@@ ics , or what other people per@@ ce@@ ive as my dis@@ ability .
talk about getting by with nothing .
they 're hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent our@@ selves as often as we like .
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
so what this means , this incredi@@ ble freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or should n't be working .
you do n't want to pick the wrong mut@@ ual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dres@@ sing .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chose .
i could be parking right in front of my building . '@@ '
i 'm pretty confid@@ ent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions im@@ prove our wel@@ fare .
they actually make us worse off .
for each american , it 's about 20 tons ; for people in poor coun@@ tries , it 's less than one ton .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ produc@@ tive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 per@@ cent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1.3 .
there are other services like how we make fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ er , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we 're opti@@ mist@@ ic , we may get a reduc@@ tion of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
almost every way we make electric@@ ity today , except for the emer@@ ging ren@@ ew@@ ables and nuclear , put@@ s out co@@ 2 .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
usually , we do n't have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some do n't .
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would grab people 's imagination here ? '@@ '
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
nathan my@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and i actually are back@@ ing a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
and that 20 per@@ cent will be used up by things going on in poor coun@@ tries , still some agriculture , hope@@ fully we will have cle@@ aned up fore@@ str@@ y , cement .
they really go through it and cre@@ ate a fr@@ ame@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need broad back@@ ing for this .
so , if you have very che@@ ap fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ x@@ ities .
it 's an important advan@@ ce , but it 's like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of coun@@ tries have built them , so any@@ body who 's done a fast re@@ actor is a candi@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
there is a line of research on what 's called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co@@ 2 constr@@ ain@@ ts , then the ske@@ p@@ tics say , `@@ ` ok , i do n't care that it does n't put out co@@ 2 , i kind of wish it did put out co@@ 2 , but i guess i 'll accept it because it 's che@@ aper than what 's come before . '@@ '
he 's still , because of his earlier stuff , still associ@@ ated with the ske@@ p@@ tic camp , but he 's realized that 's a pretty lonely camp , and so , he 's making the r@@ &@@ d point .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forest@@ s , oil , gas : they 're going away , and they 're going away soon , and unless we innov@@ ate our way out of this mess , we 're going away too .
i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed bil@@ lions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
about 12 years ago , there was a story publ@@ ished , a horrible story , that lin@@ ked the epi@@ demi@@ c of au@@ tis@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , mum@@ ps and rub@@ ella vac@@ cine shot .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of me@@ as@@ les ?
he killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by insist@@ ing that bee@@ tro@@ ot , gar@@ li@@ c and lem@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drug@@ s we know can slow the course of aids .
and some of it worked , and some of it did n't .
we got rid of the stuff that did n't .
it 's law , it 's mor@@ ality , it 's pat@@ ent stuff .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
this app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we 're just as mes@@ sed up as any@@ body else is .
the first of these trap@@ s is a reluc@@ tan@@ ce to admit comple@@ x@@ ity .
now , i 'd like to start with an ex@@ ample of somebody who had a question@@ -@@ and-@@ answer session after one of my lectu@@ res repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he 'd been listening to a symph@@ ony , and it was absolutely glor@@ ious music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
or `@@ ` how was your trip to albania ? '@@ ' or something like that .
we do n't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
now this is a direct confl@@ ict between the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self .
we think of our future as anticip@@ ated memories .
and bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a tyr@@ anny of the remember@@ ing self , and you can think of the remember@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experien@@ cing self through experiences that the experien@@ cing self does n't need .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
and the main les@@ son i think that we have learned is they are really different .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experien@@ cing self .
dk : you know i think that there is recogn@@ ition of the role of happiness research in public polic@@ y .
