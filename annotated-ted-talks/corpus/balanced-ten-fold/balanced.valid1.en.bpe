you know , one of the intense pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the de@@ lights of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones pol@@ ished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of pl@@ ants .
we go through initi@@ ation rites .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the forest@@ s of bor@@ neo , or the vo@@ o@@ doo ac@@ oly@@ tes in haiti , or the warriors in the kais@@ ut desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ and@@ ero in the mountains of the andes , or a car@@ avan@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the sahara -- this is in@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally the fellow that i trav@@ eled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the god@@ dess mother of the world .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 glos@@ sy photo@@ grap@@ hs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimension@@ al in their lives .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ doo so interesting is that it 's this living relationship between the living and the dead .
what 's interesting is the metap@@ hor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
if you 've ever seen the yan@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nuf@@ f up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ xy@@ di@@ methy@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard evan shul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mus@@ h@@ rooms in mexico in the 193@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you could n't classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you 're under the effec@@ ts there 's no one home anymore to experience a hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hope@@ fully , if all is well , my pure animal magnet@@ ism will hold the knife .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
turns out though , that that 's not even where it stop@@ s .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it 's so much stronger than the white p@@ ill .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce .
they go , `@@ ` well , he 's certainly not dum@@ b enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
and as these to@@ ols become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fun inter@@ action styles .
so here 's another few people trying it out .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ f@@ tables up .
and you inj@@ ect it by just bum@@ ping up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence si@@ ft@@ able .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven 's first and four@@ th symphon@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduc@@ ed himself .
we 've made up a f@@ ake ad that 's very high resolution -- much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we 've em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah 's original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early proto@@ type of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it 's not neces@@ sar@@ ily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments that we 've put up on the website .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the l@@ hc .
and i promised to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 13@@ ,000 amp@@ s suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electr@@ ical resistance .
you know , i 've talked about some of these projec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
`@@ ` what is life ? '@@ ' is something that i think many bi@@ ologi@@ sts have been trying to understand at various level@@ s .
we 've been digit@@ iz@@ ing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ en@@ ced the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the analog world of bi@@ ology into the digital world of the computer .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical review before we did the first experim@@ ents .
initi@@ ally , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
in fact , nasa has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
it 's over 300 million molec@@ ular weight .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there 'll be four .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ orial vac@@ cin@@ es in advan@@ ce .
we 're a ways away from im@@ pro@@ ving people : our go@@ al is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
already in some shal@@ low lak@@ es in alaska , meth@@ ane is acti@@ vely bub@@ bling up out of the water .
if you look at in the con@@ text of history you can see what this is doing .
oil is a problem , and co@@ al is the most serious problem .
you probably saw it on the news .
the larg@@ est moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey co@@ al .
that 's why we 've made it our prim@@ ary go@@ al to spend a large sum of money on an adver@@ tis@@ ing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about co@@ al .
we think it 's clean -- sm@@ ells good , too .
in fact , many ancient soci@@ eti@@ es , including the gre@@ eks and the romans , believed that to ut@@ ter a curse ver@@ bal@@ ly was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , laser sur@@ ger@@ y for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , titan@@ ium knees and hip re@@ plac@@ ements for ag@@ ing bodies that are al@@ lowing people to more fully engage with their abil@@ ities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working platform@@ s allow people to self-@@ identi@@ fy , to claim their own des@@ criptions of themselves , so they can go align with global group@@ s of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
and , most import@@ antly , there 's a partner@@ ship between those per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed defic@@ ien@@ ci@@ es and our greatest creative ability .
it was summer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother 's wom@@ b . '@@ '
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typ@@ ical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
and it 's because of the experiences i 've had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experiences i 've had with them .
you can jump right into a specif@@ ic issue .
then they spend some time planning , organiz@@ ing , they sket@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ agh@@ etti .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the `@@ ` ta-@@ da '@@ ' turns into an `@@ ` u@@ h-@@ oh , '@@ ' because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to buck@@ le and to collap@@ se .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more `@@ ` u@@ h-@@ oh '@@ ' moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indigen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ aint and color@@ ful but somehow reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ gins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
all cultures through all time have constant@@ ly been engag@@ ed in a dance with new possibil@@ ities of life .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i 'm doing a lot of research rec@@ ently , you 'll see it 's a cru@@ de face of polit@@ ical domination .
the sister who had done that brave de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently stepped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of mao , and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
now , that shal@@ low history does n't sug@@ gest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challen@@ ges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing millen@@ nia .
the canadian government in april of 1999 gave back to total control of the inu@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
and the res@@ ult is -- we call it `@@ ` patient autonom@@ y , '@@ ' which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the respon@@ sibil@@ ity for dec@@ ision@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
the answer is that they expect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ criptions to be changed .
and they 're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
work -- we are bles@@ sed , as carl was pointing out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
i 'll give you one very dramat@@ ic ex@@ ample of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ tary reti@@ rement plans .
well , when there are lots of alternat@@ ives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attr@@ active features of alternat@@ ives that you rej@@ ect , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you 've chosen .
but one point it makes is that whenever you 're cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you 're cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
when there are hund@@ reds of different styles of jeans avail@@ able , and you buy one that is disap@@ pointing , and you ask why , who 's responsible ?
so the stuff i 'm talking about is the pec@@ uli@@ ar problem of modern , affluent , western soci@@ eti@@ es .
but the absence of some metap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bowl is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i susp@@ ect , dis@@ aster .
and so , we 're in a wonderful situation with electric@@ ity in the rich world .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let 's go for making it twice as che@@ ap -- we need to meet a new constr@@ aint , and that constr@@ aint has to do with co@@ 2 .
if you sum up the co@@ 2 that gets emit@@ ted , that lead@@ s to a temperature incre@@ ase , and that temperature incre@@ ase lead@@ s to some very negative effec@@ ts : the effec@@ ts on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirec@@ t effec@@ ts , in that the natural eco@@ systems ca n't ad@@ just to these rapid changes , and so you get eco@@ system collap@@ ses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain incre@@ ase of co@@ 2 to what temperature will be and where the positive fe@@ ed@@ backs are , there 's some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
we have something that 's not going up .
now , how we 're going to go forward on this -- what 's the right approach ?
there 's a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
we do need the market inc@@ enti@@ ves -- co@@ 2 ta@@ x , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
bg : well , we have n't picked a particular place , and there 's all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that 's called `@@ ` nuclear , '@@ ' so we 've got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i 've been back seeing the secre@@ tary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ enda .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ cale and lik@@ eli@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
in ter@@ ms of bi@@ g-@@ scale possible game changes , is this the big@@ gest that you 're aware of out there ?
there 's a liqu@@ id@@ -@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
now , that 's just an insur@@ ance polic@@ y .
it should n't take away from other things .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
and , listen , everyone 's ent@@ it@@ led to their opinion ; they 're even ent@@ it@@ led to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you 're not ent@@ it@@ led to ?
you 're not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . sorry , you 're not .
dis@@ astro@@ us because here 's a fact : the united states is one of the only coun@@ tries in the world where the vac@@ cine rate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
that 's fantast@@ ic . i love big pl@@ ace@@ bo .
when you start down the road where belief and magic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you do n't want to be .
there were n't christmas trees . we made it all .
he had had the experience .
there is an experien@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but bas@@ ically it has only the present .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
now , the experien@@ cing self lives its life contin@@ uo@@ usly .
the big@@ gest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
the experien@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little ap@@ petite i have for consum@@ ing memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought exper@@ iment .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experien@@ cing self over time .
the distinc@@ tion between the happiness of the experien@@ cing self and the satisfaction of the remember@@ ing self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to me@@ asure the two separ@@ ately .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really does n't te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they 're living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that gal@@ lu@@ p sur@@ vey .
60,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ o@@ rer they get .
