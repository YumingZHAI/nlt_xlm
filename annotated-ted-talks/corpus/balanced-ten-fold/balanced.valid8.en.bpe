and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritu@@ al life and cultural life that envel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the bi@@ ological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
but the wa@@ or@@ ani did n't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ doo is not a black magic cul@@ t .
descen@@ dants of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ ona civiliz@@ ation which once car@@ pet@@ ed the car@@ ib@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain of colombia , in the wake of the conqu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated volcan@@ ic massif that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain .
now , the fascin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are mao in@@ hibit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vas@@ cular pl@@ ants , do these people find these two morph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ relat@@ ed pl@@ ants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , `@@ ` the pl@@ ants talk to us . '@@ '
for some time i have been interested in the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a mag@@ ic@@ ian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the ter@@ ms that i do , which is , `@@ ` something f@@ ake is believed in enough by somebody that it be@@ comes something real . '@@ '
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i 'm just going to sque@@ eze my wrist right here .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tr@@ ick@@ ery . and you can ex@@ amine everything .
but that 's not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
and take something that is obviously a f@@ ake trick and make it seem real .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you do n't have to give people many instruc@@ tions .
and now i 'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ ums , so i can control the effect live .
we 're looking at many , many gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ lessly and contin@@ uo@@ usly zo@@ oming in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ arrang@@ ing it in any way we want .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa geo@@ spati@@ al image .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
and so this is live on the web . it 's po@@ wered by se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as : it 's everything from cell phone camer@@ as to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environ@@ ment .
and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
now that 's more impres@@ sive when you consider those magnet@@ s we@@ igh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
we 're actually starting at a new point : we 've been digit@@ iz@@ ing bi@@ ology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of bi@@ ology with desig@@ ning and syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ing life .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they wo n't any longer grow read@@ ily in e. coli -- it exhaust@@ s all the modern to@@ ols of molec@@ ular bi@@ ology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
we knew there 's a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that bi@@ ology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
we pur@@ if@@ ied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roug@@ h@@ ly , these two are as distant as human and m@@ ice -- we added a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enz@@ y@@ mes to kill all the protein@@ s , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you 'll appreciate our very so@@ phi@@ stic@@ ated grap@@ hic@@ s here .
it got expres@@ sed and it recognized the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
and i 've argu@@ ed that we 're about to perhaps cre@@ ate a new version of the camb@@ rian explosion , where there 's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
you know , we do n't know neces@@ sar@@ ily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their gen@@ etic code looks like .
but this under@@ states the ser@@ io@@ us@@ ness of this particular problem because it does n't show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into meth@@ ane by micro@@ bes .
40 per@@ cent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that mel@@ ting flow .

i always keep my thes@@ aur@@ us hand@@ y whenever i 'm writing anything , but i 'd already finished edit@@ ing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word `@@ ` dis@@ ab@@ led '@@ ' to see what i 'd find .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ g@@ aining , as a five ye@@ ar-@@ old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exerc@@ ises , un@@ succes@@ s@@ fully , of course .
this is an ex@@ ample of how adul@@ ts in positions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child .
the human ability to adap@@ t , it 's an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming adver@@ sity , and i 'm going to make an ad@@ mission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people 's questions about it , and i think i 'm starting to figure out why .
and i said , `@@ ` i 'm sorry , sir , have we met ? i do n't remember meeting you . '@@ '
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , `@@ ` in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ edly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cum of support , if left to their own dev@@ ices , a child will ach@@ ie@@ ve . '@@ '
i 'd like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century per@@ sian po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jacques dem@@ bois told me about , and the poem is called `@@ ` the god who only knows four words '@@ ' : `@@ ` every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of do n@@ '@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and ke@@ eps repe@@ ating them , saying , ` come dance with me .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it 's that the whole of the data in which we consum@@ e is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i 'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patter@@ ns pop and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll go ahead and i 'll cl@@ ick on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of .
and so you get the idea that when you navig@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ ader , back@@ ing in , back@@ ing out -- you 're not searching , you 're not brow@@ sing .

because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it 's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you 'll just put it off until tomorrow .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they do n't have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
i believe a signific@@ ant -- not the only , but a signific@@ ant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disap@@ pointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they 're at fault .
there 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it does n't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
because the truth of the matter is that if you shat@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bowl so that everything is possible , you do n't have freedom . you have par@@ aly@@ sis .
and it 's a great thing for this number to go up .
and , in fact , these kids do n't , so they 're going out and reading their school work under the street lamp@@ s .
now , effic@@ ien@@ cy , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ quit@@ os .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
i 'm told they do n't bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gathered in these technologies is dramat@@ ically less than a power plant .
so , we 've got big cost challen@@ ges here , we have transmission challen@@ ges : for ex@@ ample , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
is it a manhattan project ? what 's the thing that can get us there ?
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gro@@ ss has several compan@@ ies , including one called es@@ olar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it 's through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ compu@@ ters that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material 's approach , this looks like it would work .
so let 's think : how should we me@@ asure our@@ selves ?
bg : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there 's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
it would have been , even without the environ@@ mental constr@@ aint , but the environ@@ mental constr@@ aint just makes it so much greater .
let 's pretend right here we have a machine .
and i wonder what you 'd choose , because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go back .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
and to my mind , the scientif@@ ic meth@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it does n't -- is one of the great accompl@@ ish@@ ments of human@@ ity .
but here 's the thing that ke@@ eps me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ eps me up at night : we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we 've also never been in a position to deplo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
same thing , only bigger .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i could n't understand why people thought this was `@@ ` franken@@ fo@@ ods , '@@ ' why they thought moving molec@@ ules around in a specif@@ ic , rather than a ha@@ pha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature 's ground .
but here 's the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have me@@ as@@ les here ?
he took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we do n't trust the man .
it makes them feel good . '@@ '
well , the things i constant@@ ly hear are : too many chem@@ ic@@ als , pest@@ ici@@ des , hormon@@ es , mon@@ ocul@@ ture , we do n't want giant fields of the same thing , that 's wrong .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 per@@ cent more food than we do right now , 70 per@@ cent .
and why ? genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
the stories of the colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es were different , and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ oses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that 's the sur@@ geon that will be chosen .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remember@@ ing self .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a confl@@ ict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adju@@ dic@@ ate that confl@@ ict , and it 's actually not at all obvious , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in ter@@ ms of memories , you might get another answer .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
but now , because the reflec@@ tive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
but danny , the whole american ende@@ av@@ or is about life , liberty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
the recogn@@ ition is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.@@ k. , it is happening , and in other coun@@ tries it is happening .
people are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y .
this is going to influence polic@@ y , i think , in years to come .
