and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive imper@@ atives .
it 's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ quis@@ itive species .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mat@@ ical rules .
and of those 6,000 langu@@ ages , as we sit here today in monter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .

that 's why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that `@@ ` you white people go to church and speak about god .
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demonstr@@ ations : vo@@ o@@ doo ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tran@@ ce hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affec@@ t the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ z@@ ed in the state of extreme excit@@ ation .

and for this entire time , they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that main@@ tain the proposition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the ec@@ ological -- balance .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . '@@ '
there 's not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ amp@@ s of the as@@ mat or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of tibet , but they have , never@@ thel@@ ess , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a tradition@@ al myst@@ ique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is breathed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ ness .
now , what does that mean ?
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the mao .
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ m , `@@ ` tri@@ al and error , '@@ ' which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
and then you ask them how they estab@@ lis@@ h their tax@@ onom@@ y and they say , `@@ ` i thought you knew something about pl@@ ants .
this is really my flesh . this is not dam@@ ian 's speci@@ al-@@ grown flesh .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and sol@@ ve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spati@@ al relation@@ ships .
so , as a computer sci@@ ent@@ ist insp@@ i@@ red by this util@@ ity of our inter@@ actions with physical objec@@ ts -- along with my advis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ evan kal@@ ani@@ thi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ tip moving around a flat des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physic@@ ally , arrang@@ ing it the way we wanted ?
in a nut@@ shell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ kie .
and these inter@@ active por@@ traits are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are effec@@ ts that you can control live , like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequ@@ ence while it pl@@ ays .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclo@@ pedi@@ c knowledge of music , but he relat@@ ed to this music at a personal level .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah s@@ nav@@ ely , a gradu@@ ate student at the university of washington , co-@@ advis@@ ed by steve seit@@ z at u.@@ w.
and we can just navig@@ ate in this very simple way .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to bas@@ ically link together ?
then the amount of sem@@ antic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it 's a classic network effect .
it 's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ hc , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ hc deliber@@ ately , and sho@@ wering partic@@ les into the detec@@ tor .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , relat@@ ed actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
now we 're trying to ask , `@@ ` can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we cre@@ ate new life out of this digital universe ? '@@ '
we use over five bil@@ lion tons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rels of oil -- that 's a hundred million bar@@ rels a day .
when you think of proces@@ sing these 20 million different genes or trying to opti@@ mi@@ ze proces@@ ses to produce oc@@ tane or to produce pharmac@@ eut@@ ic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molec@@ ular bi@@ ology than the last 20 years of all science .
and we think we 'll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole petrol@@ -@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you ca n't do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
professor kat@@ ey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shal@@ low lake last winter .

one of the fast@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dirty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
re@@ power america . it 's time to get real .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i 'm celebr@@ ated for the opport@@ un@@ ities and advent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , it 's not just about the words .
anthropolo@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always re@@ quired of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bear@@ er -- this stranger had to be the bear@@ er of bad news .
the extraordin@@ ary thing is that he said he had saved new@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ings thro@@ ugh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ hood , whether win@@ ning a second grade sp@@ elling bee , mar@@ ching with the girl s@@ couts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween parade , win@@ ning my college schol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sports victor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into te@@ aching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ hn@@ emann medical school and her@@ she@@ y medical school .
it means `@@ ` to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . '@@ '
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner .
now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tue of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navig@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
they spend the major@@ ity of their time assem@@ bling the st@@ icks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
so the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 inches ; business scho@@ ols students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ garten@@ ers , better than most adul@@ ts .
because they have special skil@@ ls of facilit@@ ation .
and any team who man@@ ages and pays close attention to work will signific@@ antly im@@ prove the team 's performance .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
there are crazy ex@@ amp@@ les from around the world of how people t@@ weak and ad@@ just the system .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his to@@ ols .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , essenti@@ al to being human .
we now have an almost un@@ limited vari@@ ety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
something as dramat@@ ic as our ident@@ ity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate .
i te@@ ach wonder@@ fully intellig@@ ent students , and i as@@ sign 20 per@@ cent less work than i used to .
so that 's one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the res@@ ult of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to choose from .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
so i went to re@@ place my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , `@@ ` i want a pair of jeans . here 's my size . '@@ '
this is the official dog@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all fal@@ se . it is not true .
in@@ come re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exces@@ s choice plag@@ ues us .
co@@ 2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one .
it 's an aver@@ age of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
now that 's back from high school alge@@ bra , but let 's take a look .
the second factor is the services we use .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one bil@@ lion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on aver@@ age , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
now , there 's all sor@@ ts of gim@@ mic@@ ky solutions like that one , but they do n't really add up to much .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it 's not , and that 's to take all the co@@ 2 , after you 've burned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ sur@@ ize it , cre@@ ate a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it st@@ ays there .
who 's going to be sure ?
and , although it 's not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
so three very tou@@ gh problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the lef@@ to@@ ver waste from today 's re@@ ac@@ tors .
so , the thing that 's been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you 're reduc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite dramat@@ ically as you 're going through this process .
and it 's best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
bg : well , unfortunately , the ske@@ p@@ tics come in different camps .
they were though@@ t@@ ful people , educat@@ ed people , dec@@ ent people .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we should n't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be ske@@ p@@ tical .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
they do n't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
when paul spe@@ aks in a public hearing , he ca n't test@@ if@@ y without ar@@ med guards .
it 's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and soul@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ ford it .
we do n't want compan@@ ies ow@@ ning se@@ eds .
this invest@@ ment in africa over the last 30 years .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
cas@@ sav@@ a 's something that half a bil@@ lion people eat .
it 's kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o .
it does n't have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it does n't have protein , and scienti@@ sts are engineering all of that into it right now .
and the third is the fo@@ cus@@ ing il@@ lusion , and it 's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we ca n't think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
this is an old study .
because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , `@@ ` how bad was the whole thing , in total ? '@@ '
for the remember@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is barely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memories added .
and this is a bit hard to justif@@ y i think .
i mean , how much do we consum@@ e our memories ?
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memories of that thre@@ e-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destroy@@ ed , and you 'll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you wo n't remember anything .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experien@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
how to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remember@@ ing self or you think of the experien@@ cing self .
