just to know that jagu@@ ar sham@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the inu@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the dhar@@ ma , is to really remember the central revel@@ ation of anthro@@ pol@@ ogy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our line@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succes@@ s@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive imper@@ atives .
we 're all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separation of death , so it should n't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what 's interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
all of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritu@@ al life and cultural life that envel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the bi@@ ological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ itions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is human@@ ity 's great leg@@ acy .
it 's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ quis@@ itive species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no bi@@ ologi@@ sts , for ex@@ ample , would dare sug@@ gest that 50 per@@ cent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinc@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ calyp@@ tic scenario in the real@@ m of bi@@ ological diver@@ sity -- scar@@ cel@@ y appro@@ aches what we know to be the most opti@@ mist@@ ic scenario in the real@@ m of cultural diver@@ sity .
and the great indicat@@ or of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 langu@@ ages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mat@@ ical rules .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an eco@@ system of spiritu@@ al possibil@@ ities .
and of those 6,000 langu@@ ages , as we sit here today in monter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
they 're no longer being taught to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ tively , unless something changes , they 're already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be envel@@ oped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wis@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roug@@ h@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the grave the last syl@@ lab@@ les of an ancient tongue .
and i know there 's some of you who say , `@@ ` well , would n't it be better , would n't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? '@@ ' and i say , `@@ ` great , let 's make that language yor@@ uba . let 's make it cant@@ on@@ ese .
and you 'll suddenly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what i 'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
take , for ex@@ ample , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the north@@ west amazon , the people of the an@@ acon@@ da who believe that myth@@ olog@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sac@@ red s@@ nak@@ es .
now , this is a people who cog@@ nit@@ iv@@ ely do not distingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called `@@ ` linguist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ amy : '@@ ' you must marry someone who spe@@ aks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the myth@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
or , one of the most fascin@@ ating trib@@ es i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ astern ecuador , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first contac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five mission@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a crit@@ ical mistake .
they picked up these photo@@ grap@@ hs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they spe@@ ared the five mission@@ aries to death .
but the wa@@ or@@ ani did n't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they spe@@ ared each other .
54 per@@ cent of their mortal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early '@@ 80@@ s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ filtr@@ ating the secret soci@@ eti@@ es which were the foundation of du@@ vali@@ er 's strength and ton@@ ton mac@@ ou@@ tes , and secur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make zom@@ bies .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ doo is not a black magic cul@@ t .
there 's always one continent left out , the assum@@ ption being that sub-@@ sah@@ aran africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ doo is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic di@@ as@@ pora of the sla@@ very era .
so , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
the spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from beneath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te be@@ comes the god .
that 's why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that `@@ ` you white people go to church and speak about god .
and because you are posses@@ sed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demonstr@@ ations : vo@@ o@@ doo ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tran@@ ce hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affec@@ t the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ z@@ ed in the state of extreme excit@@ ation .
now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that i 've ever been with , the most extraordin@@ ary are the ko@@ gi of the sierra nevada de santa mar@@ ta in northern colombia .
descen@@ dants of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ ona civiliz@@ ation which once car@@ pet@@ ed the car@@ ib@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain of colombia , in the wake of the conqu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated volcan@@ ic massif that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain .
in a blood@@ st@@ ained continent , these people alone were never con@@ quer@@ ed by the span@@ ish .
to this day , they remain rul@@ ed by a ritu@@ al pri@@ est@@ hood but the training for the pri@@ est@@ hood is rather extraordin@@ ary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ quest@@ ered in a shado@@ wy world of darkness in stone hut@@ s at the base of glac@@ iers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year perio@@ ds deliber@@ ately chosen to mim@@ ic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother 's wom@@ b ; now they are metap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that main@@ tain the proposition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the ec@@ ological -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that crystal moment of a@@ waren@@ ess of first light as the sun beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ ning@@ ly beautiful lands@@ cape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning glory . and the priest steps back and says , `@@ ` you see ? it 's really as i 've told you .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . '@@ '
they call themselves the `@@ ` el@@ der brothers '@@ ' and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for dest@@ ro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important .
whenever we think of indigen@@ ous people and lands@@ cape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke rous@@ seau and the old can@@ ard of the `@@ ` noble sav@@ age , '@@ ' which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ plic@@ ity , or alternat@@ iv@@ ely , we in@@ vo@@ ke tho@@ reau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
there 's not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ amp@@ s of the as@@ mat or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of tibet , but they have , never@@ thel@@ ess , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a tradition@@ al myst@@ ique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is breathed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ ness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the andes who 's raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a pro@@ found@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that re@@ source or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it 's the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relev@@ ant .
i was raised in the forest@@ s of british columbia to believe those forest@@ s exist@@ ed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the kw@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forest@@ s were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ w@@ hu@@ kw and the cro@@ ok@@ ed be@@ ak of heaven and the can@@ n@@ ibal spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could cre@@ ate different re@@ alit@@ ies , you could begin to understand some of their extraordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
it 's a photo@@ graph i took in the north@@ west amazon just last april .
this is ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active preparation of the sh@@ aman 's repertoire .
what makes ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca fascin@@ ating is not the she@@ er pharmac@@ ological potential of this preparation , but the elabor@@ ation of it . it 's made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ ody li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue haz@@ y smoke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it 's mixed with the leaves of a shr@@ ub in the coffee family called psych@@ otr@@ ia vir@@ idi@@ s .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ oton@@ in , di@@ methy@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5-@@ metho@@ xy@@ di@@ methy@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rif@@ le bar@@ rel lined with bar@@ oque pain@@ t@@ ings and landing on a sea of electric@@ ity .
it does n't cre@@ ate the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they can not be taken or@@ ally because they 're den@@ at@@ ured by an enz@@ yme found natur@@ ally in the human gut called mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the mao .
now , the fascin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are mao in@@ hibit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vas@@ cular pl@@ ants , do these people find these two morph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ relat@@ ed pl@@ ants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ m , `@@ ` tri@@ al and error , '@@ ' which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , `@@ ` the pl@@ ants talk to us . '@@ '
well , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 varie@@ ties of ay@@ ahu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they estab@@ lis@@ h their tax@@ onom@@ y and they say , `@@ ` i thought you knew something about pl@@ ants .
i mean , do n't you know anything ? '@@ ' and i said , `@@ ` no . '@@ '
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
now , that 's not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
for some time i have been interested in the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a mag@@ ic@@ ian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the ter@@ ms that i do , which is , `@@ ` something f@@ ake is believed in enough by somebody that it be@@ comes something real . '@@ '
in other words , sugar pil@@ ls have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kin@@ ds of studies , the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmac@@ eut@@ ical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for ex@@ ample , if they believe it enough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the pl@@ ace@@ bo effect .
something f@@ ake be@@ comes something real because of someone 's percep@@ tion of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
i 'll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i 'm just going to sque@@ eze my wrist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i 'm squeez@@ ing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tr@@ ick@@ ery . and you can ex@@ amine everything .
so , this is a trick that i often te@@ ach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about decep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even though it 's a very simple trick meth@@ od@@ olog@@ ically .
i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
nice one .
someone who did n't have a chil@@ d@@ hood is out there .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
and we could talk about why this is decep@@ tive , why you do n't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it proces@@ ses information , it does n't count , one , two , three . it group@@ s them .
but that 's not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it 's cl@@ inging there , not by animal magnet@@ ism , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my index finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
it turns out that if you administ@@ er a pl@@ ace@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that 's like aspir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it 's just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain me@@ as@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you change the form that you give the pl@@ ace@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmac@@ eut@@ ical -- they 're sugar pil@@ ls .
what ? that really flipped me out .
but the point is ...
and if you want the ultimate in pl@@ ace@@ bo , you 've go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ ring@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inj@@ ect this into a patient ...
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ s@@ ule is not as good as the need@@ le .
and none of it has any real pharmac@@ eut@@ ical qu@@ ality , it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
and take something that is obviously a f@@ ake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ inch hat@@ pin . it 's very , very sharp , and i 'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my flesh . this is not dam@@ ian 's speci@@ al-@@ grown flesh .
i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
if you 're que@@ as@@ y -- if you faint easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i did n't know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i sug@@ gest if you get que@@ as@@ y easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i 'll do the first bad part behind it .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essenti@@ ally we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
but you ca n't count my fingers right now can you ?
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
and the people in the back go , `@@ ` ok , i did n't really see that . '@@ '
let me give you good close look at this .
i 'm sorry . if you 're getting que@@ as@@ y , look away , do n't look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , `@@ ` well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blo@@ cks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and sol@@ ve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spati@@ al relation@@ ships .
spati@@ al reason@@ ing is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer sci@@ ent@@ ist insp@@ i@@ red by this util@@ ity of our inter@@ actions with physical objec@@ ts -- along with my advis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ evan kal@@ ani@@ thi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ tip moving around a flat des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physic@@ ally , arrang@@ ing it the way we wanted ?
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building si@@ f@@ tables .
in a nut@@ shell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ kie .
they 're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wi@@ re@@ less radio .
most import@@ antly , they 're physical , so like the blo@@ cks , you can move them just by reaching out and gras@@ ping .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i til@@ t it in one direction , it 'll roll the video this way ; if i til@@ t it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active por@@ traits are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
one of the interesting implic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to realize , was that we could use every@@ day gest@@ ures on data , like pour@@ ing a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we 've got three si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint buck@@ ets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some ne@@ at possibil@@ ities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the resul@@ ts immediately .
here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mas@@ h-@@ up between scr@@ ab@@ ble and bog@@ g@@ le .
bas@@ ically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a diction@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibil@@ ities to try .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you do n't have to give people many instruc@@ tions .
so to him , they were just blo@@ cks .
and we wanted to build a learning to@@ ol for language lear@@ ners .
and he can bring new charac@@ ters into the scene , just by lifting the si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character sho@@ wn on them .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
it 's an op@@ en-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
so , the last ex@@ ample i have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ en@@ cing and live performance to@@ ol that we 've built rec@@ ently , in which si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead , bass and dr@@ ums .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inj@@ ect these sounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ semble into the pat@@ tern that you want .
there are effec@@ ts that you can control live , like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it .
so let 's have a look .
we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence si@@ f@@ tables , ar@@ range them into a series , exten@@ d it , add a little more lead .
and now i 'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ ums , so i can control the effect live .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequ@@ ence while it pl@@ ays .
so i do n't have to plan it out in advan@@ ce , but i can im@@ pro@@ vise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new hum@@ an-@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our br@@ ains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibil@@ ities that we 're working to bring out of the labor@@ atory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we 're on the cus@@ p of this new generation of to@@ ols for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ ms .
and the source was a man , an afric@@ an-@@ american man , char@@ ming , rug@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
and i 'm telling a story that many of you know , because steve 's colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert dow@@ ney jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie fo@@ xx as na@@ than@@ iel anthony ay@@ ers , the ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ train@@ ed double bas@@ s@@ ist whose prom@@ ising career was cut short by a trag@@ ic af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ ano@@ id sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel dropped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of ski@@ d row in down@@ town los angeles .
i encour@@ age all of you to read steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely was instrum@@ ental -- if you 'll par@@ don the p@@ un -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vial and greg@@ ari@@ ous way about yo-@@ yo ma and hil@@ lar@@ y clinton and how the dod@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ erous first viol@@ in passage work in the last movement of beethoven 's four@@ th symph@@ ony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an em@@ ail from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a viol@@ in les@@ son with me .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel refus@@ es treat@@ ment because when he was treated it was with shock therap@@ y and thor@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a res@@ ult now , he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic episodes , the worst of which can manif@@ est themselves as him explo@@ ding and then dis@@ appe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of ski@@ d row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ as@@ hed upon him .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first les@@ son at walt disney concert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes , he was lost .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if i started talking about s@@ cales and ar@@ peg@@ gi@@ os and other excit@@ ing form@@ s of di@@ d@@ acti@@ c viol@@ in pedag@@ ogy .
and as i played , i understood that there was a pro@@ found change occur@@ ring in na@@ than@@ iel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmac@@ eut@@ ical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclo@@ pedi@@ c knowledge of music , but he relat@@ ed to this music at a personal level .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ ano@@ id , distur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ ud@@ ite , brilli@@ ant , ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ train@@ ed music@@ ian .
because music allo@@ ws him to take his thoughts and del@@ us@@ ions and shape them through his imagination and his cre@@ ativ@@ ity , into reality .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exist@@ s within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artist@@ ic lens , through our cre@@ ativ@@ ity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we 're at walt disney concert hall or on ski@@ d row , because he remin@@ ds me why i became a music@@ ian .
robert gu@@ pta : i 'm going to play something that i sh@@ amel@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cel@@ list@@ s .
what i 'm going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some found@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ quisition almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , and it 's an environ@@ ment in which you can either local@@ ly or remo@@ tely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amo@@ un@@ ts of visual data .
we 're looking at many , many gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ lessly and contin@@ uo@@ usly zo@@ oming in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ arrang@@ ing it in any way we want .
and it does n't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordin@@ ary digital camera photos , but this one , for ex@@ ample , is a s@@ can from the library of congress , and it 's in the 300 meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el range .
it does n't make any difference because the only thing that ou@@ ght to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flex@@ ible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an ex@@ ample of non-@@ image data .
to prove to you that it 's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it 's not a picture .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a new@@ sp@@ aper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real estate .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p-@@ up@@ s and other kind of rub@@ bis@@ h like that -- should n't be necessary .
and this one i really wo n't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa geo@@ spati@@ al image .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah s@@ nav@@ ely , a gradu@@ ate student at the university of washington , co-@@ advis@@ ed by steve seit@@ z at u.@@ w.
and so this is live on the web . it 's po@@ wered by se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
but the spati@@ al arrang@@ ement of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken near gras@@ si lak@@ es in the canadian roc@@ kies -- all these sho@@ ts were taken . so you see elements here of stab@@ iliz@@ ed sli@@ de-@@ show or panor@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been relat@@ ed spati@@ ally .
this is a re@@ construction of notre dame cathedr@@ al that was done entirely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images scrap@@ ed from flick@@ r . you just type notre dame into flick@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es re@@ presents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
and so these are all flick@@ r images , and they 've all been relat@@ ed spati@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navig@@ ate in this very simple way .
it 's very grat@@ if@@ ying to have this kind of reception here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as : it 's everything from cell phone camer@@ as to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environ@@ ment .
this is actually a po@@ ster of notre dame that regi@@ ster@@ ed correc@@ tly .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environ@@ ment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that 's greater than the sum of the parts .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and whose benef@@ its become greater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
if somebody bo@@ thered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else 's photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mo@@ dal and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to bas@@ ically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really excit@@ ing when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ antic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phras@@ es , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of sem@@ antic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it 's a classic network effect .
its job is to re@@ cre@@ ate the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ lion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it 's nothing if not amb@@ iti@@ ous .
spectac@@ ular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale .
it 's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ hc , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ hc deliber@@ ately , and sho@@ wering partic@@ les into the detec@@ tor .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great trium@@ ph .
i do n't know whether this got the big@@ gest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , relat@@ ed actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , `@@ ` no they do n't . they 're small wi@@ res . '@@ '
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
so at min@@ us 271 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
now that 's more impres@@ sive when you consider those magnet@@ s we@@ igh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
now of course , in a way those accid@@ ents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refu@@ te .
i think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that we 're over@@ reaching , is the value of things like the l@@ hc .
we 're actually starting at a new point : we 've been digit@@ iz@@ ing bi@@ ology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of bi@@ ology with desig@@ ning and syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ing life .
now we 're trying to ask , `@@ ` can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we cre@@ ate new life out of this digital universe ? '@@ '
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ co@@ plasma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the smal@@ l@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the labor@@ atory , and we 've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller gen@@ ome .
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metabol@@ ic map , it 's relativ@@ ely simple compar@@ ed to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very un@@ likely that this would y@@ ield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could var@@ y the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
can chem@@ ist@@ ry per@@ mit making these really large molec@@ ules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
so , our pace of digit@@ iz@@ ing life has been increas@@ ing at an expon@@ enti@@ al pace .
our ability to write the gen@@ etic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increas@@ ing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an expon@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
there are tens of thous@@ ands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it 's a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the gen@@ ome of phi x 174 .
we desig@@ ned the pieces , went through our error correc@@ tion and had a dna molec@@ ule of about 5,000 letters .
the excit@@ ing phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bac@@ teria , and the bac@@ teria started to read this gen@@ etic code , made the vir@@ al partic@@ les .
the vir@@ al partic@@ les then were released from the cell@@ s and came back and killed the e. coli .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chromo@@ some -- it 's over 5@@ 80,000 letters of gen@@ etic code -- so we thought we 'd build them in cas@@ set@@ tes the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually var@@ y the cas@@ set@@ tes to understand what the actual compon@@ ents of a living cell are .
design is crit@@ ical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
we actually found , on rese@@ qu@@ en@@ cing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that original sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be boot@@ ed up .
part of the design is desig@@ ning pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ lap with all the other 50-@@ letter pieces to build smaller su@@ bun@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ marks in .
trip@@ lets of those letters code for roug@@ h@@ ly 20 amino ac@@ ids , such that there 's a single letter design@@ ation for each of the amino ac@@ ids .
we desig@@ ned these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes ; there are enz@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abun@@ dance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we 're trying to cre@@ ate a process that 's extre@@ mely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
we 're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they wo n't any longer grow read@@ ily in e. coli -- it exhaust@@ s all the modern to@@ ols of molec@@ ular bi@@ ology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
we knew there 's a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that bi@@ ology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here 's an ex@@ ample of it : there 's an organis@@ m called de@@ ino@@ coc@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions rad@@ s of radi@@ ation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thous@@ ands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
these organis@@ ms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
here 's an actual micro@@ graph of the molec@@ ule we built using these proces@@ ses , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast put@@ s them together automat@@ ically .
it 's such a large molec@@ ule we can see it with a light micro@@ scope .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
this is over 5@@ 80,000 letters of gen@@ etic code ; it 's the larg@@ est molec@@ ule ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 font with no spac@@ ing , it takes 142 pages just to print this gen@@ etic code .
it 's also sim@@ pler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like our@@ selves : you can just pop out the nucle@@ us and pop in another one , and that 's what you 've all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
with bac@@ teria and archa@@ ea , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we rec@@ ently showed that we can do a complete tran@@ sp@@ lant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pur@@ if@@ ied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roug@@ h@@ ly , these two are as distant as human and m@@ ice -- we added a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enz@@ y@@ mes to kill all the protein@@ s , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you 'll appreciate our very so@@ phi@@ stic@@ ated grap@@ hic@@ s here .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kin@@ ds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thous@@ ands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of bi@@ ology .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell does n't have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
it got expres@@ sed and it recognized the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the protein@@ s changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the gen@@ etic code , it 's exactly what we had transfer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dramat@@ ically .
now i 've argu@@ ed , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half bil@@ lion years of evolution .
and i 've argu@@ ed that we 're about to perhaps cre@@ ate a new version of the camb@@ rian explosion , where there 's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
i think this is pretty obvious in ter@@ ms of some of the needs .
we 're about to go from six and a half to nine bil@@ lion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in con@@ text for myself : i was born in 1946 .
it 's going to be a stret@@ ch to do it for nine .
we use over five bil@@ lion tons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rels of oil -- that 's a hundred million bar@@ rels a day .
then of course , there 's all that co@@ 2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future .
the electron@@ ics industry only had a dozen or so compon@@ ents , and look at the diver@@ sity that came out of that .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid metho@@ ds of synth@@ esis , to do what we 're calling combin@@ at@@ orial genom@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
when you think of proces@@ sing these 20 million different genes or trying to opti@@ mi@@ ze proces@@ ses to produce oc@@ tane or to produce pharmac@@ eut@@ ic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molec@@ ular bi@@ ology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it 's just standard selection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fu@@ el production , vac@@ cine production , etc. .
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we do n't know neces@@ sar@@ ily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their gen@@ etic code looks like .
you 've seen rec@@ ently , cor@@ n to e@@ than@@ ol is just a bad exper@@ iment .
we have second - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relativ@@ ely soon that are sugar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tane or different types of but@@ an@@ ol .
but the only way we think that bi@@ ology can have a major impact without further increas@@ ing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ stock , and so we 're working with desig@@ ning cell@@ s to go down this road .
and we think we 'll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kin@@ ds of other metho@@ ds .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
it takes co@@ 2 to meth@@ ane using molec@@ ular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
we 're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co@@ 2 , which can easily be pip@@ ed to sites , conver@@ t that co@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the basic question is of `@@ ` what is life ? '@@ '
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole petrol@@ -@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you ca n't do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we 're now working on using these same to@@ ols to come up with instant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you 've seen this year with f@@ lu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vac@@ cine .
here 's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolu@@ tion@@ ary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bac@@ teria , archa@@ ea and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes .
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the arc@@ tic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shr@@ unk by 40 per@@ cent .
but this under@@ states the ser@@ io@@ us@@ ness of this particular problem because it does n't show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
the arc@@ tic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global clim@@ ate system .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that 's the ann@@ ual ice in winter , and it contr@@ acts in summer .
in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into meth@@ ane by micro@@ bes .
compar@@ ed to the total amount of global war@@ ming pollu@@ tion in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
professor kat@@ ey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shal@@ low lake last winter .
she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enor@@ mous heat sink he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an ann@@ ual mel@@ ting river .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
this is the kang@@ er@@ lus@@ su@@ aq river in south@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level r@@ ises from land-@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
these flo@@ ws are increas@@ ing very rapid@@ ly .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tica the larg@@ est mass of ice on the planet .
last month scienti@@ sts repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tica cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly rapid in its mel@@ ting .
that 's equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
40 per@@ cent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that mel@@ ting flow .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in california there has been a 40 per@@ cent dec@@ line in the sierra snow@@ pack .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ voirs .
and the predic@@ tions , as you 've read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramat@@ ic incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
and the dis@@ aster@@ s around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extraordin@@ ary and un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed rate .
this is a completely un@@ sust@@ ain@@ able pat@@ tern .
in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of co@@ 2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oce@@ ans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxy@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al pl@@ ants .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been cancel@@ led in the last few years with some green alternat@@ ives pro@@ posed .
around christmas , in my home in tennessee , a bil@@ lion gal@@ lons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was spil@@ led .
this , all over the country , is the second larg@@ est waste stream in america .
fro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a jol@@ ly , happy soul .
he 's af@@ ford@@ able and ador@@ able , and wor@@ kers keep their pay .
at coal@@ er@@ gy we view clim@@ ate change as a very serious threat to our business .
leave that up to us .
clean co@@ al -- you 've heard a lot about it .
so let 's take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean co@@ al facil@@ ity .
amazing ! the mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of loud .
take a good long look : this is today 's clean co@@ al technology .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
america is in crisis -- the econom@@ y , national security , the clim@@ ate crisis .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our ad@@ diction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dirty co@@ al and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
re@@ power america with 100 per@@ cent clean electric@@ ity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global war@@ ming .
finally , a solution that 's big enough to sol@@ ve our problems .
re@@ power america . find out more .
it 's about re@@ power@@ ing america .
one of the fast@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dirty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy gri@@ d .
re@@ power america . it 's time to get real .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , `@@ ` if you want to go quickly , go alone .
i always keep my thes@@ aur@@ us hand@@ y whenever i 'm writing anything , but i 'd already finished edit@@ ing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word `@@ ` dis@@ ab@@ led '@@ ' to see what i 'd find .
`@@ ` dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ jec@@ tive : cri@@ pp@@ led , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ rec@@ ked , stal@@ led , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ unded , mang@@ led , lam@@ e , mut@@ il@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n-@@ out , weak@@ ened , im@@ po@@ tent , ca@@ str@@ ated , par@@ aly@@ z@@ ed , handi@@ cap@@ ped , sen@@ ile , decre@@ pit , la@@ id@@ -up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hurt , us@@ eless and weak .

i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us , but i 'd just gotten past `@@ ` mang@@ led , '@@ ' and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collec@@ t myself from the emo@@ tional shock and impact that the as@@ sault from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
you know , of course , this is my rag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ aur@@ us so i 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting prim@@ ary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as relat@@ ed to the other kids and the world around me .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i was n't using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i 'm celebr@@ ated for the opport@@ un@@ ities and advent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth no@@ ting .
so , it 's not just about the words .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who 's em@@ po@@ wered ?
by casu@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and casting shadows on their power .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ numer@@ able repet@@ itions of exerc@@ ises with these thick , elast@@ ic bands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ g@@ aining , as a five ye@@ ar-@@ old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exerc@@ ises , un@@ succes@@ s@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaust@@ ive and un@@ for@@ giving , these ses@@ sions -- and he said to me , `@@ ` wow . aim@@ ee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you 're going to break one of those bands .
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p 's part to get me to do the exerc@@ ises i did n't want to do before the prosp@@ ect of being the rich@@ est f@@ iv@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old in the second floor ward , but what he effec@@ tively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily occur@@ rence into a new and prom@@ ising experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
this is an ex@@ ample of how adul@@ ts in positions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest as@@ set .
the human ability to adap@@ t , it 's an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming adver@@ sity , and i 'm going to make an ad@@ mission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people 's questions about it , and i think i 'm starting to figure out why .
implic@@ it in this phrase of `@@ ` over@@ coming adver@@ sity '@@ ' is the idea that succes@@ s , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience un@@ s@@ ca@@ thed or un@@ marked by the experience , as if my succes@@ ses in life have come about from an ability to side@@ step or circum@@ navig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ st@@ het@@ ics , or what other people per@@ ce@@ ive as my dis@@ ability .
and i 'm going to sug@@ gest that this is a good thing .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there 's very little , but it 's always with me .
and , certainly , i 'm not trying to dimin@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person 's strugg@@ le .
so , our respon@@ sibil@@ ity is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from adver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equip@@ ped to adap@@ t .
there 's an important difference and distinc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subj@@ ec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al opinion of whether or not i 'm dis@@ ab@@ led .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability i 've had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be descri@@ bed by those definit@@ ions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ gno@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ gno@@ sis on the expected qu@@ ality of their life , we have to make sure that we do n't put the first brick in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serv@@ es to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
by not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not acknow@@ led@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of whatever natural strugg@@ le they might have .
we are effec@@ tively grad@@ ing someone 's worth to our community .
so it 's not about dev@@ alu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opport@@ un@@ ities wrapped in the adver@@ sity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming adver@@ sity as it is opening our@@ selves up to it , em@@ brac@@ ing it , grap@@ pling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adver@@ sity as natural , consist@@ ent and use@@ ful , we 're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
to parap@@ hr@@ ase : it 's not the strong@@ est of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intellig@@ ent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human s@@ kill .
and , perhaps , until we 're test@@ ed , we do n't know what we 're made of .
so , we can give our@@ selves a gift .
if we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ ie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibil@@ ity -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ ities with the community .
anthropolo@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always re@@ quired of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there 's evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 60,000 years ago , carried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ jury , and perhaps it 's because the life experience of surviv@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
they did n't view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and val@@ u@@ able .
and i said , `@@ ` i 'm sorry , sir , have we met ? i do n't remember meeting you . '@@ '
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bear@@ er -- this stranger had to be the bear@@ er of bad news .
the extraordin@@ ary thing is that he said he had saved new@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ings thro@@ ugh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ hood , whether win@@ ning a second grade sp@@ elling bee , mar@@ ching with the girl s@@ couts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween parade , win@@ ning my college schol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sports victor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into te@@ aching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ hn@@ emann medical school and her@@ she@@ y medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ gno@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of someone 's life .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , `@@ ` in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ edly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cum of support , if left to their own dev@@ ices , a child will ach@@ ie@@ ve . '@@ '
and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ st@@ het@@ ics for fles@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i would n't have hesitated for a second .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you 're off .
it means `@@ ` to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . '@@ '
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s brit@@ ain , when they were moving from gram@@ mar scho@@ ols to comprehen@@ sive scho@@ ols .
it 's separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
well , they took , over a thre@@ e-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a 's , told them they were `@@ ` a 's , '@@ ' told them they were bright , and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
and , of course , the heart@@ breaking , f@@ lip side of this study , is that they took the `@@ ` a students '@@ ' and told them they were `@@ ` d 's . '@@ '
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
the te@@ ach@@ ers did n't know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , `@@ ` these are the ` a-@@ students , ' these are the ' d - students . ' '@@ ' and that 's how they went about te@@ aching them and tre@@ ating them .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
i 'd like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century per@@ sian po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jacques dem@@ bois told me about , and the poem is called `@@ ` the god who only knows four words '@@ ' : `@@ ` every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of do n@@ '@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and ke@@ eps repe@@ ating them , saying , ` come dance with me .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it 's that the whole of the data in which we consum@@ e is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i 'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patter@@ ns pop and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we 're looking at right here is a typ@@ ical mortal@@ ity chart organiz@@ ed by age .
it 's called pi@@ vot , and with pi@@ vot what i can do is i can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of death@@ s -- say , accid@@ ents .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organize the data by cause of death , seeing that circul@@ atory dis@@ eas@@ es and cancer are the usual suspec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
and if you dr@@ ill into that , it 's especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like sw@@ im@@ ming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustr@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll go ahead and i 'll cl@@ ick on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , `@@ ` well , what about taking a look at all of cyc@@ ling ? '@@ '
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
and so you get the idea that when you navig@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ ader , back@@ ing in , back@@ ing out -- you 're not searching , you 're not brow@@ sing .
so the sum@@ mary consist@@ s of just a little syno@@ p@@ sis and an icon to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i 'm only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
it 's only possible to see that in@@ sight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dr@@ ill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win@@ ners .
so pi@@ vot , this application -- i do n't want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it 's really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specif@@ ic section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tue of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sl@@ ice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic searching , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vot .
and from these , i can dr@@ ill into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
we talk about the curse of information over@@ load .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navig@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wis@@ dom to be found .
and the idea 's pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tal@@ l@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 st@@ icks of sp@@ agh@@ etti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
so , normally , most people begin by orient@@ ing themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jo@@ c@@ key for power .
they spend the major@@ ity of their time assem@@ bling the st@@ icks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ inger@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-@@ da ! -- they ad@@ m@@ ire their work .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more `@@ ` ta-@@ da '@@ ' structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of sp@@ agh@@ etti , inc. . right ?
and the reason is that business students are train@@ ed to find the single right plan , right ?
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder@@ garten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build proto@@ types , succes@@ sive proto@@ types , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build proto@@ types along the way .
design@@ ers recognize this type of collaboration as the es@@ sence of the iter@@ ative process .
so the capac@@ ity to play in proto@@ type is really essenti@@ al , but let 's look at how different teams per@@ form .
so the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 inches ; business scho@@ ols students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ garten@@ ers , better than most adul@@ ts .
who does the very best ?
thir@@ ty-@@ nine inches is the tal@@ l@@ est structure i 've seen .
if you put you put an execu@@ tive ad@@ min . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it 's incredi@@ ble . you know , you look around , you go , `@@ ` oh , that team 's going to win . '@@ '
because they have special skil@@ ls of facilit@@ ation .
and any team who man@@ ages and pays close attention to work will signific@@ antly im@@ prove the team 's performance .
if you have 10 teams that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
i thought , let 's up the ante , once .
here 's what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so there 's deep les@@ sons for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succes@@ s .
and the reason is , i help cre@@ ate digital to@@ ols and proces@@ ses to help teams build cars and video games and visual effec@@ ts .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ fy the hidden assum@@ p@@ tions .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right proto@@ type .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
there are crazy ex@@ amp@@ les from around the world of how people t@@ weak and ad@@ just the system .
it demand@@ s that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we ap@@ ply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little proto@@ type of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an `@@ ` u@@ h-@@ oh '@@ ' moment to a `@@ ` ta-@@ da '@@ ' moment .
well , the truth is the 20@@ th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its techn@@ ological innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either acti@@ vely en@@ dor@@ sed or passi@@ vely accepted the massive destruction of both bi@@ ological and cultural diver@@ sity on the planet . now , the problem is n't change .
the si@@ oux indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ oux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bug@@ gy .
wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disco@@ ver that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capac@@ ity to adap@@ t to : whether it 's the eg@@ regi@@ ous de@@ forest@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to ser@@ vit@@ ude and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the banks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ neo away to the south china sea , where the japan@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw lo@@ gs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yan@@ om@@ ami , it 's the disease ent@@ ities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
you know , gen@@ oci@@ de , the physical extinc@@ tion of a people is univer@@ sally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it 's univer@@ sally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strateg@@ y .
and you can not understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once trav@@ el@@ led 6,000 miles from cheng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern tibet to l@@ hasa with a young colle@@ ague , and it was only when i got to l@@ hasa that i understood the face behind the statist@@ ics you hear about : 6,000 sac@@ red monuments tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es , 1.2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the cultural revolution .
his uncle f@@ led with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ pora that took the people to nepal .
he was s@@ mug@@ g@@ led into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt ta@@ ils because she could n't bear to be without him .
the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear , but the rede@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embr@@ ace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diver@@ sity ?
margaret me@@ ad , the great anthro@@ pol@@ og@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduc@@ ed to a more narrow modal@@ ity of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibil@@ ities .
and it 's hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for -@@ ls@@ b@@ - 15@@ 0,000 -@@ r@@ sb@@ - years .
the ne@@ olith@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ etr@@ y of the sh@@ aman was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ est@@ hood ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ation sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it 's within that song that we will all re@@ disco@@ ver the possibil@@ ity of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to flo@@ ur@@ ish . and there are great moments of opti@@ mis@@ m .
this is a photo@@ graph i took at the northern tip of baf@@ fin island when i went nar@@ w@@ hal hun@@ ting with some inu@@ it people , and this man , olay@@ uk , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
the canadian government has not always been kind to the inu@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to estab@@ lis@@ h our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ lem@@ ents .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his to@@ ols .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wrapped in cari@@ bo@@ u hide .
he simply slipped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tro@@ us@@ ers and defec@@ ated into his hand . and as the fec@@ es began to fre@@ eze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a blade .
he put a spr@@ ay of sali@@ va on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
he skin@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ cage of the dog and improvis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ nes@@ sed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es , shit knife in belt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
an amazing ex@@ ample of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek rest@@ itu@@ tion with its people .
they 're hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
so , what we 're trying to do at the national geo@@ graphic , finally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never accompl@@ ish anything .
we think that polem@@ ics -- -- we think that polem@@ ics are not persu@@ as@@ ive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
and what we 're doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we 're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they can not help but come away daz@@ z@@ led by what they have seen , and hope@@ fully , there@@ fore , embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central revel@@ ation of anthro@@ pol@@ ogy : that this world de@@ serv@@ es to ex@@ ist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , plur@@ alist@@ ic world where all of the wis@@ dom of all pe@@ op@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collec@@ tive well-@@ being .
i 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that i hope will reson@@ ate with other things you 've already heard , and i 'll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you miss them .
and the official dog@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ fare of our cit@@ iz@@ ens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , essenti@@ al to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ fare , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ fare they have .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it would n't occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
175 sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you do n't count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virgin ol@@ ive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings , in the off-@@ chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
we can construc@@ t si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ million different ster@@ eo systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on offer in one store .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
we now have an almost un@@ limited vari@@ ety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
and if by some chance you have n't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it lead@@ s people to walk into their sto@@ res asking this question .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that does n't do too much .
so , in other aspec@@ ts of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , `@@ ` well , we could do a , or we could do b .
and the doc says , `@@ ` a has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and b has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
and the doc says , `@@ ` but i 'm not you . '@@ '
why do they market to us if we ca n't buy them ?
something as dramat@@ ic as our ident@@ ity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent our@@ selves as often as we like .
and that means that every@@ day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
no@@ wad@@ ays , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
i te@@ ach wonder@@ fully intellig@@ ent students , and i as@@ sign 20 per@@ cent less work than i used to .
and it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less dil@@ ig@@ ent .
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
there is one corner , by the way , that i 'm not going to tell any@@ body about , where the w@@ ifi works .
so what this means , this incredi@@ ble freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or should n't be working .
and even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mut@@ il@@ ate a soccer game , we are also asking our@@ selves , `@@ ` should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this em@@ ail ? should i draft this letter ? '@@ '
that is to say , there were some cho@@ ices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
we all know what 's good about it , so i 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it .
a colle@@ ague of mine got access to invest@@ ment records from vangu@@ ard , the gig@@ antic mut@@ ual fund company of about a million emplo@@ ye@@ es and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it 's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you 'll just put it off until tomorrow .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they do n't have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
by not particip@@ ating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you do n't want to pick the wrong mut@@ ual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dres@@ sing .
so that 's one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the res@@ ult of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to choose from .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad dres@@ sing is ? -- it 's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative indu@@ ces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chose .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compar@@ e them to .
here 's an ex@@ ample . for those of you who are n't new yor@@ kers , i apologi@@ ze .
i could be parking right in front of my building . '@@ '
and he sp@@ ends two weeks nag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attr@@ active features of these op@@ tions are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity cost@@ s .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
and those other things may have lots of attr@@ active features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attr@@ active .
this hit me when i went to re@@ place my jeans .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
and there was a time when jeans came in one flav@@ or , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredi@@ bly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to re@@ place my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , `@@ ` i want a pair of jeans . here 's my size . '@@ '
and the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ eper said , `@@ ` do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
my jaw dropped , and after i reco@@ vered , i said , `@@ ` i want the kind that used to be the only kind . '@@ '
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the best@@ -@@ fit@@ ting jeans i had ever had .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions avail@@ able , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one flav@@ or .
when they came in 100 flav@@ ors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compar@@ ed what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disap@@ pointing in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people 's lives ca n't help but incre@@ ase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
no@@ wad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industri@@ aliz@@ ed cit@@ iz@@ ens , with perfec@@ tion the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
finally , one consequence of bu@@ ying a bad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satisfied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
with a hundred different kin@@ ds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for fail@@ ure .
clin@@ ical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a signific@@ ant -- not the only , but a signific@@ ant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disap@@ pointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they 're at fault .
this is the official dog@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it does n't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
i 'm pretty confid@@ ent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions im@@ prove our wel@@ fare .
now , as a polic@@ y matter -- i 'm almost done -- as a polic@@ y matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial soci@@ eti@@ es is material afflu@@ ence .
and what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vit@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expen@@ sive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats do n't help . it 's a waste of money .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our soci@@ eti@@ es to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shifted to soci@@ eti@@ es in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people 's lives be im@@ pro@@ ved , but ours would be im@@ pro@@ ved also .
in@@ come re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exces@@ s choice plag@@ ues us .
im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished imagination , a myo@@ pic view of the world -- and that 's the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you shat@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bowl so that everything is possible , you do n't have freedom . you have par@@ aly@@ sis .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
and that might seem a bit surpris@@ ing because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deli@@ ver to help the po@@ o@@ rest two bil@@ lion live better lives .
the clim@@ ate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps wo n't grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile environ@@ ment simply ca n't support .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to redu@@ ce po@@ ver@@ ty , by far you would pick energy .
really advanced civiliz@@ ation is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
the co@@ al revolution fu@@ eled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 190@@ 0s we 've seen a very rapid dec@@ line in the price of electric@@ ity , and that 's why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condit@@ ion@@ ing , we can make modern materi@@ als and do so many things .
co@@ 2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one .
and there 's certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effec@@ ts will be , but they will be extre@@ mely bad .
i asked the top scienti@@ sts on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
it 's very different than saying `@@ ` we 're a twel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truck trying to get under a ten-@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of sque@@ eze under . '@@ '
this is something that has to get to zero .
for each american , it 's about 20 tons ; for people in poor coun@@ tries , it 's less than one ton .
it 's an aver@@ age of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
it 's been constant@@ ly going up .
it 's only various economic changes that have even flat@@ tened it at all , so we have to go from rapid@@ ly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that 's back from high school alge@@ bra , but let 's take a look .
first , we 've got population .
the world today has 6.@@ 8 bil@@ lion people .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ produc@@ tive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 per@@ cent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ com@@ passes everything : the food we eat , clothing , tv , he@@ ating .
and it 's a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one bil@@ lion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on aver@@ age , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
and , in fact , these kids do n't , so they 're going out and reading their school work under the street lamp@@ s .
now , effic@@ ien@@ cy , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally .
there are other services like how we make fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ er , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we 're opti@@ mist@@ ic , we may get a reduc@@ tion of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we 've gone from 26 bil@@ lion to , at best , maybe 13 bil@@ lion tons , and that just wo n't cut it .
so let 's look at this four@@ th factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co@@ 2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn co@@ al , no .
almost every way we make electric@@ ity today , except for the emer@@ ging ren@@ ew@@ ables and nuclear , put@@ s out co@@ 2 .
and so , we need energy mir@@ acles .
now , when i use the term `@@ ` miracle , '@@ ' i do n't mean something that 's impossible .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
usually , we do n't have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some do n't .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight ti@@ mel@@ ine .
now , i thought , `@@ ` how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would grab people 's imagination here ? '@@ '
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ quit@@ os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rele@@ asing fi@@ ref@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environ@@ ment here this year .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
i 'm told they do n't bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
now , there 's all sor@@ ts of gim@@ mic@@ ky solutions like that one , but they do n't really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ v@@ able scale and un@@ belie@@ v@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there 's many directions people are seek@@ ing , i really only see five that can ach@@ ie@@ ve the big numbers .
i 've left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five , and we ca n't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have signific@@ ant challen@@ ges .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it 's not , and that 's to take all the co@@ 2 , after you 've burned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ sur@@ ize it , cre@@ ate a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it st@@ ays there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 per@@ cent level , but getting up to that full per@@ cent@@ age , that will be very tric@@ ky , and agre@@ eing on where these co@@ 2 quant@@ ities should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-@@ term issue .
who 's going to be sure ?
who 's going to gu@@ aran@@ tee something that is liter@@ ally bil@@ lions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in ter@@ ms of nuclear or other things ?
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in high@@ ly regul@@ ated coun@@ tries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fu@@ el does n't get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it 's not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
so three very tou@@ gh problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ ew@@ able sources .
and they actually -- although it 's great they do n't requ@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ ages .
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gathered in these technologies is dramat@@ ically less than a power plant .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you 're talking about many square miles , thous@@ ands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
so , we 've got big cost challen@@ ges here , we have transmission challen@@ ges : for ex@@ ample , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
and , to dimension@@ aliz@@ e this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for compu@@ ters , for phones , for flash@@ lights , for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electr@@ ical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 better than the appro@@ aches we have now .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 per@@ cent of what you 're using .
if you 're coun@@ ting on it for 100 per@@ cent , you need an incredi@@ ble miracle batter@@ y .
is it a manhattan project ? what 's the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of compan@@ ies working on this , hund@@ reds .
and a lot of them , you 'll look at and say , `@@ ` they 're crazy . '@@ ' that 's good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gro@@ ss has several compan@@ ies , including one called es@@ olar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ od kho@@ s@@ la 's invest@@ ing in do@@ zen@@ s of compan@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting possibil@@ ities , and i 'm trying to help back that .
nathan my@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and i actually are back@@ ing a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
and innov@@ ation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas lay@@ ing around is not all that surpris@@ ing .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it 's through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ compu@@ ters that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material 's approach , this looks like it would work .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the lef@@ to@@ ver waste from today 's re@@ ac@@ tors .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it 's a great thing .
it breath@@ es this uran@@ ium as it goes along , so it 's kind of like a cand@@ le .
you can see it 's a log there , often refer@@ red to as a trav@@ eling wave re@@ actor .
this is the lef@@ to@@ ver , the 99 per@@ cent , where they 've taken out the part they burn now , so it 's called dep@@ let@@ ed uran@@ ium .
and , simply by fil@@ tering se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expen@@ sive process , you 'd have enough fu@@ el for the entire life@@ time of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it 's got lots of challen@@ ges ahead , but it is an ex@@ ample of the many hund@@ reds and hund@@ reds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let 's think : how should we me@@ asure our@@ selves ?
and that 20 per@@ cent will be used up by things going on in poor coun@@ tries , still some agriculture , hope@@ fully we will have cle@@ aned up fore@@ str@@ y , cement .
so , the other grade is : are we deplo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emission technology , have we deplo@@ yed it in all the develop@@ ed coun@@ tries and we 're in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
that 's a key element of making that report card .
we should go through these effic@@ ien@@ cy me@@ as@@ ures to start getting reduc@@ tions : the less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of co@@ 2 , and , there@@ fore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that do n't get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these break@@ thro@@ ug@@ hs .
these break@@ thro@@ ug@@ hs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can me@@ asure that in ter@@ ms of compan@@ ies , pilot projec@@ ts , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
they really go through it and cre@@ ate a fr@@ ame@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need broad back@@ ing for this .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who 's president , i could pick a vac@@ cine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that 's half the cost with no co@@ 2 gets invent@@ ed -- this is the wish i would pick .
if we do n't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor coun@@ tries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two bil@@ lion will be far worse .
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
when coun@@ tries get together in places like copen@@ hagen , they should n't just discus@@ s the co@@ 2 .
they should discus@@ s this innov@@ ation ag@@ enda , and you 'd be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low level@@ s of spen@@ ding on these innov@@ ative appro@@ aches .
we need to have this di@@ alogue be a more ration@@ al , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ alogue , including the steps that the government takes .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ rap@@ o@@ wer , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of invest@@ ment this is ?
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hire all the great scienti@@ sts , which we 've done , that 's only tens of millions , and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a rus@@ sian re@@ actor to make sure that our materi@@ als work proper@@ ly , then you 'll only be up in the hund@@ reds of millions .
the tou@@ gh thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several bil@@ lion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adver@@ tis@@ ed , then it 's just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a vertic@@ al kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fu@@ el , of this sort of spent uran@@ ium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
bg : that 's right . today , you 're always refu@@ eling the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of control@@ s that can go wrong : that thing where you 're opening it up and moving things in and out , that 's not good .
so , if you have very che@@ ap fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ x@@ ities .
and it just sit@@ s there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it 's done .
bg : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there 's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exist@@ s today , that 's sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that 's our fu@@ el to begin with .
so , the thing that 's been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you 're reduc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite dramat@@ ically as you 're going through this process .
so i 'm opti@@ mist@@ ic . you know , the french and japan@@ ese have done some work .
it 's an important advan@@ ce , but it 's like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of coun@@ tries have built them , so any@@ body who 's done a fast re@@ actor is a candi@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that 's very che@@ ap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to deplo@@ y .
that 's sort of the dead@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to meet .
and it 's best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
it would have been , even without the environ@@ mental constr@@ aint , but the environ@@ mental constr@@ aint just makes it so much greater .
you know , we do n't know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that 's a different approach .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molec@@ ule of uran@@ ium has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ ule of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essenti@@ ally the radi@@ ation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in ter@@ ms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
bg : if you get into that situation , it 's like if you 've been over@@ -@@ eating , and you 're about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
there is a line of research on what 's called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
some people say you should n't even work on the insur@@ ance polic@@ y because it might make you laz@@ y , that you 'll keep eating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to save you .
i 'm not sure that 's wise , given the importance of the problem , but there 's now the geo@@ engineering discus@@ sion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innov@@ ation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the ske@@ p@@ tics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientif@@ ic argum@@ ents are very few .
and so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the ip@@ cc report , that 's not neces@@ sar@@ ily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ip@@ cc and say , `@@ ` ok , that is n't that big of a deal . '@@ '
the fact is it 's that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co@@ 2 constr@@ ain@@ ts , then the ske@@ p@@ tics say , `@@ ` ok , i do n't care that it does n't put out co@@ 2 , i kind of wish it did put out co@@ 2 , but i guess i 'll accept it because it 's che@@ aper than what 's come before . '@@ '
and so , that would be your response to the bjor@@ n lom@@ borg argument , that bas@@ ically if you spend all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the co@@ 2 problem , it 's going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to rid the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and malaria and so forth , it 's a stupid waste of the earth 's re@@ sources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual spen@@ ding on the r@@ &@@ d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 bil@@ lion a year more than it is right now -- it 's not that dramat@@ ic .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reason@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that 's non-@@ economic and you 're trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you 're very close and you 're just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it 's going to get very che@@ ap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expen@@ sive .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fest@@ yle .
his sh@@ tic@@ k now is , `@@ ` why is n't the r@@ &@@ d getting more discus@@ sed ? '@@ '
he 's still , because of his earlier stuff , still associ@@ ated with the ske@@ p@@ tic camp , but he 's realized that 's a pretty lonely camp , and so , he 's making the r@@ &@@ d point .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropri@@ ate .
well bill , i susp@@ ect i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
let 's pretend right here we have a machine .
and i wonder what you 'd choose , because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go back .
it 's because possibil@@ ities on this planet , they do n't go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any me@@ asure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobil@@ ity , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
my gre@@ at-@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
and to my mind , the scientif@@ ic meth@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it does n't -- is one of the great accompl@@ ish@@ ments of human@@ ity .
and one of them is that despite all our accompl@@ ish@@ ments , a bil@@ lion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tras@@ h this globe .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forest@@ s , oil , gas : they 're going away , and they 're going away soon , and unless we innov@@ ate our way out of this mess , we 're going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed bil@@ lions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that does n't also destroy it .
but here 's the thing that ke@@ eps me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ eps me up at night : we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we 've also never been in a position to deplo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we 're on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hund@@ reds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progress , when we fought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people wrap themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so tightly that you ca n't set them free .
and i was amaz@@ ed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effec@@ tive public health me@@ asure in human history .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i could n't understand why people thought this was `@@ ` franken@@ fo@@ ods , '@@ ' why they thought moving molec@@ ules around in a specif@@ ic , rather than a ha@@ pha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature 's ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
and that 's because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were driving me crazy were n't actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
they were though@@ t@@ ful people , educat@@ ed people , dec@@ ent people .
we 're at a point in this world where we do n't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic ter@@ ms with little qu@@ otes around it : `@@ ` progress . '@@ '
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we should n't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be ske@@ p@@ tical .
but here 's the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
about 12 years ago , there was a story publ@@ ished , a horrible story , that lin@@ ked the epi@@ demi@@ c of au@@ tis@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , mum@@ ps and rub@@ ella vac@@ cine shot .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have me@@ as@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of me@@ as@@ les ?
does n't happen very much .
that 's a lot of death of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it did n't happen here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like jenny mccar@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from platform@@ s like `@@ ` o@@ pr@@ ah '@@ ' and `@@ ` larry king live . '@@ '
and they can do it because they do n't link caus@@ ation and cor@@ relation .
they do n't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
he took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . pol@@ io -- pu@@ ff , gone .
he just develop@@ ed a rot@@ av@@ irus vac@@ cine with a bunch of other people .
well , it 's good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
when paul spe@@ aks in a public hearing , he ca n't test@@ if@@ y without ar@@ med guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
we have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
today , i do n't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he 's flying to la@@ x , right now he 's over ohio .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to long beach , and he 's going to atten@@ d one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infec@@ ted with a par@@ aly@@ tic disease , and we do n't either because that 's the way the world works .
that 's the planet we live on . do n't pretend it is n't .
now , we love to wrap our@@ selves in lies . we love to do it .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it does n't matter how often we find out that they 're us@@ eless .
the data says it all the time .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big phar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we do n't trust the man .
and we should n't : our health care system su@@ cks .
it 's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and soul@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ ford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we le@@ ap into the arms of big pl@@ ace@@ bo .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend bil@@ lions of dollars on it .
and i have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , frau@@ d ; ech@@ in@@ acea , frau@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i do n't even know what that is but we 're spen@@ ding bil@@ lions of dollars on it -- it 's frau@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , `@@ ` what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . '@@ '
because i do n't care if it 's the secre@@ tary of h@@ hs who 's saying , `@@ ` h@@ mm , i 'm not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on mam@@ mo@@ gram@@ s , '@@ ' or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
he killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by insist@@ ing that bee@@ tro@@ ot , gar@@ li@@ c and lem@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drug@@ s we know can slow the course of aids .
please , do n't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epi@@ demi@@ c we 're in the middle of right now is this absur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food and the organ@@ ic elite .
every single thing we eat , every gr@@ ain of rice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sley , every brus@@ sels s@@ pro@@ ut has been modi@@ fied by man .
and some of it worked , and some of it did n't .
we got rid of the stuff that did n't .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vit@@ amin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prol@@ ong their lives .
i have to say , i do n't understand it .
we object to genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
well , the things i constant@@ ly hear are : too many chem@@ ic@@ als , pest@@ ici@@ des , hormon@@ es , mon@@ ocul@@ ture , we do n't want giant fields of the same thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't compan@@ ies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
we do n't want compan@@ ies ow@@ ning se@@ eds .
it 's true , we 've got a huge food problem , but this is n't science .
it 's law , it 's mor@@ ality , it 's pat@@ ent stuff .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very de@@ aden@@ ing , and it 's pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from prosper@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 per@@ cent more food than we do right now , 70 per@@ cent .
this invest@@ ment in africa over the last 30 years .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
and why ? genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
we do n't want to encour@@ age people to eat that rotten stuff , like cas@@ sav@@ a for in@@ stance .
cas@@ sav@@ a 's something that half a bil@@ lion people eat .
it 's kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o .
it does n't have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it does n't have protein , and scienti@@ sts are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
i mean , let 's ask our@@ selves : why are we fighting it ?
this is n't about rice kr@@ is@@ pies , this is about keeping people alive , and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant .
if we do n't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that i do n't think we want to be guilty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's sel@@ fish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , `@@ ` so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? '@@ '
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we 're going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we 're going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , that 's something the world needs right now .
i had somebody count the number of books with `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' in the title publ@@ ished in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among rese@@ arch@@ ers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ aching .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in sp@@ ite of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cogn@@ itive trap@@ s that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cogn@@ itive trap@@ s .
this app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we 're just as mes@@ sed up as any@@ body else is .
the first of these trap@@ s is a reluc@@ tan@@ ce to admit comple@@ x@@ ity .
it turns out that the word `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' is just not a use@@ ful word anymore , because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restr@@ ict it , but by and large , this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adop@@ t the more complic@@ ated view of what well-@@ being is .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they 're both lum@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the fo@@ cus@@ ing il@@ lusion , and it 's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we ca n't think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive trap .
there 's just no way of getting it right .
now , i 'd like to start with an ex@@ ample of somebody who had a question@@ -@@ and-@@ answer session after one of my lectu@@ res repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he 'd been listening to a symph@@ ony , and it was absolutely glor@@ ious music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it had n't .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memories of the experience .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
it 's the experien@@ cing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , `@@ ` does it hurt now when i touch you here ? '@@ '
and then there is a remember@@ ing self , and the remember@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ eps score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it 's the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , `@@ ` how have you been feeling lat@@ ely ? '@@ '
or `@@ ` how was your trip to albania ? '@@ ' or something like that .
those are two very different ent@@ ities , the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remember@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
this is an old study .
those are actual pati@@ ents under@@ going a pain@@ ful procedure .
i wo n't go into detail . it 's no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
and you are asked , `@@ ` who of them suff@@ ered more ? '@@ '
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : `@@ ` how much did these pati@@ ents think they suff@@ ered ? '@@ '
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than patient b .
the stories of the colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es were different , and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distinc@@ t ...
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it 's a bad story .
because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , `@@ ` how bad was the whole thing , in total ? '@@ '
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct confl@@ ict between the experien@@ cing self and the remember@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually exten@@ d the colon@@ os@@ copy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experien@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remember@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endo@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 -- most of them do n't leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remember@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it 's the fin@@ ite re@@ source that we 're spen@@ ding while we 're on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remember@@ ing self ke@@ eps for us .
so we have the remember@@ ing self and the experien@@ cing self , and they 're really quite distinc@@ t .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
that 's not the way it works at all for the remember@@ ing self .
for the remember@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is barely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memories added .
and in this way , time is actually the crit@@ ical variable that distingu@@ ishes a remember@@ ing self from an experien@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remember@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ oses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that 's the sur@@ geon that will be chosen .
we actually do n't choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we do n't think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticip@@ ated memories .
and bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a tyr@@ anny of the remember@@ ing self , and you can think of the remember@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experien@@ cing self through experiences that the experien@@ cing self does n't need .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remember@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to justif@@ y i think .
i mean , how much do we consum@@ e our memories ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remember@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i 've ever had , and i think of it relativ@@ ely often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memories of that thre@@ e-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discre@@ pan@@ cy .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destroy@@ ed , and you 'll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you wo n't remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a confl@@ ict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adju@@ dic@@ ate that confl@@ ict , and it 's actually not at all obvious , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in ter@@ ms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can ap@@ ply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experien@@ cing self ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a fair@@ ly complic@@ ated process .
what are the emotions that can be me@@ asu@@ red ?
if you ask for the happiness of the remember@@ ing self , it 's a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
anyone who does n't distingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who 've been mes@@ sing up the study of happiness for a long time in precis@@ ely this way .
the gal@@ lu@@ p organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main les@@ son i think that we have learned is they are really different .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , `@@ ` oh his father is six feet tall , '@@ ' how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there 's a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experien@@ cing self .
we know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satisfied with people that we like , spen@@ ding time with people that we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant .
so if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we can not think straight about happiness is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in clim@@ ate .
well , it turns out that clim@@ ate is not very important to the experien@@ cing self and it 's not even very important to the reflec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the reflec@@ tive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experien@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you . i 've got a question for you .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
i think the most interesting res@@ ult that we found in the gal@@ lu@@ p sur@@ vey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experien@@ cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , var@@ y with in@@ come .
and it turns out that , below an in@@ come of 60,000 dollars a year , for americ@@ ans -- and that 's a very large samp@@ le of americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00,000 , so it 's a large represent@@ ative samp@@ le -- below an in@@ come of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i 've rar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experien@@ ti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can me@@ asure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
in ter@@ ms of the other self , the remember@@ ing self , you get a different story .
but danny , the whole american ende@@ av@@ or is about life , liberty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for ex@@ ample , tax@@ ation polic@@ y and so forth .
is there any chance that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public polic@@ y based on it ?
dk : you know i think that there is recogn@@ ition of the role of happiness research in public polic@@ y .
the recogn@@ ition is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.@@ k. , it is happening , and in other coun@@ tries it is happening .
people are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y .
it 's going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evalu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fair@@ ly soon .
how to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remember@@ ing self or you think of the experien@@ cing self .
this is going to influence polic@@ y , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , efforts are being made to me@@ asure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next de@@ cade or two , part of national statist@@ ics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y discus@@ sion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ oral econom@@ ics .
thank you , danny kah@@ nem@@ an .
