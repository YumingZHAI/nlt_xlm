we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separation of death , so it should n't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 langu@@ ages spoken on the planet .
they 're no longer being taught to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ tively , unless something changes , they 're already dead .
they picked up these photo@@ grap@@ hs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they spe@@ ared the five mission@@ aries to death .
54 per@@ cent of their mortal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ oton@@ in , di@@ methy@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5-@@ metho@@ xy@@ di@@ methy@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
obviously it 's cl@@ inging there , not by animal magnet@@ ism , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my index finger being there .
but if you change the form that you give the pl@@ ace@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive .
if you 're que@@ as@@ y -- if you faint easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i did n't know , and one woman almost passed out .
well let me work up some blood for you .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it .
but as a res@@ ult now , he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic episodes , the worst of which can manif@@ est themselves as him explo@@ ding and then dis@@ appe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of ski@@ d row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ as@@ hed upon him .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we 're at walt disney concert hall or on ski@@ d row , because he remin@@ ds me why i became a music@@ ian .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real estate .
and so these are all flick@@ r images , and they 've all been relat@@ ed spati@@ ally in this way .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phras@@ es , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
spectac@@ ular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great trium@@ ph .
so at min@@ us 271 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metabol@@ ic map , it 's relativ@@ ely simple compar@@ ed to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very un@@ likely that this would y@@ ield a living cell .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the gen@@ ome of phi x 174 .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chromo@@ some -- it 's over 5@@ 80,000 letters of gen@@ etic code -- so we thought we 'd build them in cas@@ set@@ tes the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually var@@ y the cas@@ set@@ tes to understand what the actual compon@@ ents of a living cell are .
design is crit@@ ical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
we have thous@@ ands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
here 's an actual micro@@ graph of the molec@@ ule we built using these proces@@ ses , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast put@@ s them together automat@@ ically .
this is over 5@@ 80,000 letters of gen@@ etic code ; it 's the larg@@ est molec@@ ule ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
you 've seen rec@@ ently , cor@@ n to e@@ than@@ ol is just a bad exper@@ iment .
we have second - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relativ@@ ely soon that are sugar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tane or different types of but@@ an@@ ol .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that 's the ann@@ ual ice in winter , and it contr@@ acts in summer .
last month scienti@@ sts repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
that 's equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
in california there has been a 40 per@@ cent dec@@ line in the sierra snow@@ pack .
in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of co@@ 2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oce@@ ans .
future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy gri@@ d .
ant@@ ony@@ ms , heal@@ thy , strong , capable . '@@ '
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who 's em@@ po@@ wered ?
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaust@@ ive and un@@ for@@ giving , these ses@@ sions -- and he said to me , `@@ ` wow . aim@@ ee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you 're going to break one of those bands .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equip@@ ped to adap@@ t .
so it 's not about dev@@ alu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opport@@ un@@ ities wrapped in the adver@@ sity .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human s@@ kill .
it 's called pi@@ vot , and with pi@@ vot what i can do is i can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of death@@ s -- say , accid@@ ents .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organize the data by cause of death , seeing that circul@@ atory dis@@ eas@@ es and cancer are the usual suspec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like sw@@ im@@ ming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
and the reason is that business students are train@@ ed to find the single right plan , right ?
it 's incredi@@ ble . you know , you look around , you go , `@@ ` oh , that team 's going to win . '@@ '
and the reason is , i help cre@@ ate digital to@@ ols and proces@@ ses to help teams build cars and video games and visual effec@@ ts .
the si@@ oux indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ oux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bug@@ gy .
his uncle f@@ led with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ pora that took the people to nepal .
the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear , but the rede@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embr@@ ace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diver@@ sity ?
and it 's within that song that we will all re@@ disco@@ ver the possibil@@ ity of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to flo@@ ur@@ ish . and there are great moments of opti@@ mis@@ m .
the canadian government has not always been kind to the inu@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to estab@@ lis@@ h our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ lem@@ ents .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wrapped in cari@@ bo@@ u hide .
so , what we 're trying to do at the national geo@@ graphic , finally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never accompl@@ ish anything .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it would n't occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
175 sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you do n't count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virgin ol@@ ive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ings , in the off-@@ chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
we can construc@@ t si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ million different ster@@ eo systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on offer in one store .
and if by some chance you have n't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
so , in other aspec@@ ts of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compar@@ e them to .
and he sp@@ ends two weeks nag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attr@@ active features of these op@@ tions are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity cost@@ s .
and there was a time when jeans came in one flav@@ or , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredi@@ bly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
and so i compar@@ ed what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disap@@ pointing in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our soci@@ eti@@ es to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shifted to soci@@ eti@@ es in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people 's lives be im@@ pro@@ ved , but ours would be im@@ pro@@ ved also .
im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished imagination , a myo@@ pic view of the world -- and that 's the way i read it at first .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
and so , we need energy mir@@ acles .
i 've left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
who 's going to gu@@ aran@@ tee something that is liter@@ ally bil@@ lions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in ter@@ ms of nuclear or other things ?
and , to dimension@@ aliz@@ e this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for compu@@ ters , for phones , for flash@@ lights , for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electr@@ ical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 better than the appro@@ aches we have now .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 per@@ cent of what you 're using .
vin@@ od kho@@ s@@ la 's invest@@ ing in do@@ zen@@ s of compan@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting possibil@@ ities , and i 'm trying to help back that .
and , simply by fil@@ tering se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expen@@ sive process , you 'd have enough fu@@ el for the entire life@@ time of the rest of the planet .
we should go through these effic@@ ien@@ cy me@@ as@@ ures to start getting reduc@@ tions : the less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of co@@ 2 , and , there@@ fore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that do n't get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these break@@ thro@@ ug@@ hs .
when coun@@ tries get together in places like copen@@ hagen , they should n't just discus@@ s the co@@ 2 .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adver@@ tis@@ ed , then it 's just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and it just sit@@ s there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it 's done .
so i 'm opti@@ mist@@ ic . you know , the french and japan@@ ese have done some work .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molec@@ ule of uran@@ ium has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ ule of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essenti@@ ally the radi@@ ation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in ter@@ ms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
the ones who make scientif@@ ic argum@@ ents are very few .
and so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the ip@@ cc report , that 's not neces@@ sar@@ ily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ip@@ cc and say , `@@ ` ok , that is n't that big of a deal . '@@ '
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
does n't happen very much .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . pol@@ io -- pu@@ ff , gone .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to long beach , and he 's going to atten@@ d one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infec@@ ted with a par@@ aly@@ tic disease , and we do n't either because that 's the way the world works .
the data says it all the time .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vit@@ amin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prol@@ ong their lives .
it 's true , we 've got a huge food problem , but this is n't science .
i mean , let 's ask our@@ selves : why are we fighting it ?
it turns out that the word `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' is just not a use@@ ful word anymore , because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things .
there 's just no way of getting it right .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
i wo n't go into detail . it 's no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
and how to spend it would seem to be relev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remember@@ ing self ke@@ eps for us .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experien@@ cing self .
and it turns out that , below an in@@ come of 60,000 dollars a year , for americ@@ ans -- and that 's a very large samp@@ le of americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00,000 , so it 's a large represent@@ ative samp@@ le -- below an in@@ come of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
in ter@@ ms of the other self , the remember@@ ing self , you get a different story .
in the united states , efforts are being made to me@@ asure the experience happiness of the population .
