but what 's interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
all of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the earth .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an eco@@ system of spiritu@@ al possibil@@ ities .
and you 'll suddenly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called `@@ ` linguist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ amy : '@@ ' you must marry someone who spe@@ aks a different language .
the spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from beneath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te be@@ comes the god .
it means that a young kid from the andes who 's raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a pro@@ found@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that re@@ source or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
i was raised in the forest@@ s of british columbia to believe those forest@@ s exist@@ ed to be cut .
nice one .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
but the point is ...
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
let me give you good close look at this .
i 'm sorry . if you 're getting que@@ as@@ y , look away , do n't look at the thing .
bas@@ ically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a diction@@ ary .
so to him , they were just blo@@ cks .
and he can bring new charac@@ ters into the scene , just by lifting the si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character sho@@ wn on them .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if i started talking about s@@ cales and ar@@ peg@@ gi@@ os and other excit@@ ing form@@ s of di@@ d@@ acti@@ c viol@@ in pedag@@ ogy .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exist@@ s within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artist@@ ic lens , through our cre@@ ativ@@ ity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and it does n't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p-@@ up@@ s and other kind of rub@@ bis@@ h like that -- should n't be necessary .
it 's very grat@@ if@@ ying to have this kind of reception here .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that 's greater than the sum of the parts .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and whose benef@@ its become greater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , `@@ ` no they do n't . they 're small wi@@ res . '@@ '
i think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that we 're over@@ reaching , is the value of things like the l@@ hc .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could var@@ y the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
we started this over 15 years ago .
you may have read that we put water@@ marks in .
these organis@@ ms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
and with a very short period of time , all the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
i think this is pretty obvious in ter@@ ms of some of the needs .
the electron@@ ics industry only had a dozen or so compon@@ ents , and look at the diver@@ sity that came out of that .
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
here 's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolu@@ tion@@ ary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bac@@ teria , archa@@ ea and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes .
the arc@@ tic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global clim@@ ate system .
this is the kang@@ er@@ lus@@ su@@ aq river in south@@ west green@@ land .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ voirs .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al pl@@ ants .
here are the ones that have been cancel@@ led in the last few years with some green alternat@@ ives pro@@ posed .
he 's af@@ ford@@ able and ador@@ able , and wor@@ kers keep their pay .
leave that up to us .
amazing ! the mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of loud .
it 's about re@@ power@@ ing america .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
and i 'm going to sug@@ gest that this is a good thing .
and , certainly , i 'm not trying to dimin@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person 's strugg@@ le .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming adver@@ sity as it is opening our@@ selves up to it , em@@ brac@@ ing it , grap@@ pling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adver@@ sity as natural , consist@@ ent and use@@ ful , we 're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you 're off .
the te@@ ach@@ ers did n't know a switch had been made .
so what we 're looking at right here is a typ@@ ical mortal@@ ity chart organiz@@ ed by age .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustr@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dr@@ ill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
and from these , i can dr@@ ill into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
we talk about the curse of information over@@ load .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wis@@ dom to be found .
so , normally , most people begin by orient@@ ing themselves to the task .
sound familiar ? right .
so the capac@@ ity to play in proto@@ type is really essenti@@ al , but let 's look at how different teams per@@ form .
thir@@ ty-@@ nine inches is the tal@@ l@@ est structure i 've seen .
i thought , let 's up the ante , once .
margaret me@@ ad , the great anthro@@ pol@@ og@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduc@@ ed to a more narrow modal@@ ity of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibil@@ ities .
he simply slipped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tro@@ us@@ ers and defec@@ ated into his hand . and as the fec@@ es began to fre@@ eze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a blade .
he put a spr@@ ay of sali@@ va on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and what this does is it lead@@ s people to walk into their sto@@ res asking this question .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , `@@ ` well , we could do a , or we could do b .
and that means that every@@ day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
and even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mut@@ il@@ ate a soccer game , we are also asking our@@ selves , `@@ ` should i answer this cell phone call ?
we all know what 's good about it , so i 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people 's lives ca n't help but incre@@ ase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
finally , one consequence of bu@@ ying a bad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satisfied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
and what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vit@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expen@@ sive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats do n't help . it 's a waste of money .
really advanced civiliz@@ ation is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
this is something that has to get to zero .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight ti@@ mel@@ ine .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five , and we ca n't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have signific@@ ant challen@@ ges .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in high@@ ly regul@@ ated coun@@ tries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fu@@ el does n't get used for weapons .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you 're talking about many square miles , thous@@ ands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
it breath@@ es this uran@@ ium as it goes along , so it 's kind of like a cand@@ le .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who 's president , i could pick a vac@@ cine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that 's half the cost with no co@@ 2 gets invent@@ ed -- this is the wish i would pick .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ rap@@ o@@ wer , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of invest@@ ment this is ?
that 's sort of the dead@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to meet .
i 'm not sure that 's wise , given the importance of the problem , but there 's now the geo@@ engineering discus@@ sion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innov@@ ation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
well bill , i susp@@ ect i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
it 's because possibil@@ ities on this planet , they do n't go back , they go forward .
this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any me@@ asure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobil@@ ity , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
and one of them is that despite all our accompl@@ ish@@ ments , a bil@@ lion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it does n't matter how often we find out that they 're us@@ eless .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
because i do n't care if it 's the secre@@ tary of h@@ hs who 's saying , `@@ ` h@@ mm , i 'm not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on mam@@ mo@@ gram@@ s , '@@ ' or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
we do n't compan@@ ies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
i had somebody count the number of books with `@@ ` happiness '@@ ' in the title publ@@ ished in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
but in sp@@ ite of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cogn@@ itive trap@@ s that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memories of the experience .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it 's a bad story .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experien@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remember@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endo@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 -- most of them do n't leave a trace .
from the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
now , the remember@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can ap@@ ply , one per self .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there 's a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
now , very quickly , another reason we can not think straight about happiness is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
thank you . i 've got a question for you .
is there any chance that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public polic@@ y based on it ?
