"C-Major Pentatonic Scale" It's no good.
I can't learn this.
It's too hard for me.
Fool!
But it's better to learn the scale early.
Fool!
You stupid bird!
I'll show you!
Don't rush it, Koyuki-kun.
It's only been two months since you started playing the guitar.
But he already knows the scale...
C'mon, we need a change of pace.
Let's go swimming!
"Lucille" -Okay, here goes!
-Watch the ball!
What?
So please buy your own melon roll.
It's the truth. I was called to the faculty office.
S-see you...
Hold it, Tanaka!
Yukio Tanaka of Grade 8B.
Please go to the faculty office immediately.
I repeat...
Listen, Tanaka-kun...
I don't think you're taking your job as umbrella monitor seriously.
Oh, no...
Daily life is a series of little jobs like this.
Maybe I should put this in your student report...
I'm disappointed in you, Tanaka-kun.
You may go.
Wait, Tanaka-kun!
What is this? !
What happened?
It's nothing.
We were kidding around and Tanabe-kun did a drop kick on me.
Tanaka-kun...
And naturally, I gave it back to him with a heel hold! So it's no big deal!
Tanaka-kun...
-Did you catch that game? -Yeah!
That was awesome!
You look glum, Koyuki!
Maho!
Yo!
Maho, you sure eat a lot.
Shut up.
I'm hungry.
You'll gain weight.
You can have my fries.
Beck's first live performance has been set!
R-really?
How long is this going to continue?
I'll talk to him for you.
Okay, I'm going on deliveries, so make up for being late and work extra hard.
I'm sorry!
And don't forget to feed Page.
I'm off!
-He sure is strict. -Yeah.
Around strangers.
It's okay, I'll feed him.
-He's...
-You little-!
T-this is the last of it!
These aren't company documents!
They're Saito-san's personal treasure!
Treasure?
I mean, private collection.
Collection?
Koyuki, how long have you been working here?
-Since the end of summer break.
I want to repair the guitar Ryusuke-kun gave me.
I didn't know...
That's why I don't want to see Ryusuke-kun until the guitar is fixed.
I understand.
So, how much do you get paid?
Oh, umm...430 yen an hour.
Are you serious? !
That's crazy!
This new law sure is bad for the manufacturing industry.
-Saito-sama, this way please.
Thank you for waiting. Rie-chan!
Thank you for calling her.
-Oh, it's Ken-ken! -Rie-rie!
-I missed you sooo much!
-Me too!
What's with the get-up?
Caught a cold or something?
I'm in disguise!
But how'd you guess it was me?
You stand out too much.
Okay, it's starting!
Ryusuke-kun's guitar... Are those bullet marks? !
They're real.
Is that...
That guitar has a name... It's Lucille.
-Sounds like a woman's name.
It's a guitar with a past...
Ryusuke got it in some dangerous place. But...
It couldn't possibly have happened while he was performing? !
One, two!
Typhoon 24!
24-7!
24 hours straight!
BECK!
B-E-C-K!
We're gonna rush at you!
We're gonna send you flyin' head-first!
Lift up your heavy ass, now If you take off that stiff head you'll feel totally loose
This crazy, crazy world
You just have to Stage Dive or Die
Mind blower, a shower of sweat Run towards a new world, my life
Those who seek it will be rewarded Pass the hot shot, keep on coming, come on!
Blow your mind
Squeeze your sweat yeah
Blow your mind Squeeze your sweat
This...is Beck...
Koyuki-kun...
There's still more? !
-The guitar's fixed now. -Huh?
The one with the broken neck. I sent it out for repairs.
I-is that true?
You want to patch things up with Ryusuke, don't you?
Saito-san!
Now go, hurry!
Okay!
Koyuki-kun... Deduction for leaving early.
I think this'll do.
If you notice something while playing it, just let me know.
Now I can see Ryusuke-kun!
Hey, Tanaka...
Hey, Tanaka. Lemme play that guitar.
What an awful sound...
suits you perfectly!
Hey, Masaru.
Forget it, Rikiya-kun.
The sound is the pits.
You laughed just now, didn't you?
-Don't act innocent!
No, I thought that tune was "Anarchy in Heaven"...
Recently, the Sex Handles-
Any complaints?
Didn't think so.
It was a piece of junk anyway.
Let's go, Masaru!
Yeah.
-How about New Burger?
Did you get it, Koyuki-kun?
Yeah...
Oh, good!
It's all fixed, then?
Actually, it's been slow here at Saito Paper Company, so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard.
But it was worth it to see you smiling again!
Saito-san...
Oh, you're welcome!
Mom used to say, "From that day on, Yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar, and played it every single day."
You were great at the concert!
Think so? !
I just looove your vocals, Chiba-kun!
We won't miss your next live performance!
Then I'll put you on the guest list!
Give me your names and numbers!
Hey, Ray!
I've gotta talk to you!
What?
What're you mad about all of a sudden? Wow!
Ryusuke-kun, you speak English!
That's so cool! Yeah.
I lived in New York for a long time. So I'm more used to English than Japanese.
-That's so cool! -That's so cool!
We've got to go to New York, too!
-Tell us where you used to live!
-Yeah!
We wanna visit it!
-Sure.
-Yay!
Those idiots!
I was looking for the ab machine I bought by mail order last night... and I finally found it!
Found what?
Look!
This is it...
The L48 Eddie gave to you!
Then the one I gave to Koyuki was... That was a fake one you got at the guitar shop in Queens!
Which means...
-Ryusuke-kun! -Ryusuke-kun!
Don't get tetanus!
Yukio!
Telephone!
Yukio!
Yukio!
I called Ryusuke too.
You're joking, right?
Oh, speak of the devil.
Sorry!
Maho... Did you really explain it to him?
I did!
Idiot!
Why am I running away? !
Oh, Koyuki!
Izumi-chan!
I spoke to Ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi.
Oh... Can you say hello from me, too?
All 9th graders will report to the gym for curriculum guidance.
I repeat...
-It's almost graduation.
I'll be lonely.
See you, Koyuki!
"Dear Koyuki-kun,"
"I've decided to stay here a bit longer, so please take care of Page!"
He's extending his stay again!
Southeast Asia must have something that lures grown men...
Fool!
I haven't played yet!
Punk rockers hold their guitars low...
Awright!
Cripes!
I'd better go to sleep!
Look...
Eiji...
Look at him...
Didn't he make his band successful all by himself?
We just do things our way.
Umm... Ginger ale.
Okay.
Hey, Koyuki!
Why'd you run away the other day?
Sorry!
Koyuki! Let's go up front!
Let's go concrete hell, human safari park escape
Ape in the brain, mass brain-washing operation, no thank you
Let's walk together, step in step, and we'll get stuck in the deep
-I-is this what rap is?
-I-is this what rap is? -We're at the rebellious age, free as we go -Huh?

Wow! Amazing!
-Hey, look at that poster!
-I'm gonna get a shot of it!
So this is where Ryusuke-kun grew up! Isn't it cool!
Huh?

Woman: oh, thank you. Thank you for curing me, dr.
Freud.
Thanks to your miracle technique,
I am no longer delusional. It's called hypnosis, fraulein.
I took you back to re-Experience your childhood.
Whatever you did, it worked. I used to think that little men were following me around,
But now i know that little men Were just in meine imagination.
[Doorbell rings] Ach. Excuse me, fraulein.
You stand lookout while i write my name
In dr.
Now, fraulein, where were we? Aaah!
The little men! The little men! They're back!
Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl-Bl... aaah!
Hmm. You know, you might want to think about another appointment.
Aah! What are we going to do now, brain?
Ring some more doorbells and run away? No, pinky. Ohh!
To see the great hypnotizing psychiatrist
Dr. Sigmund freud.
Oh, bravo, brain.
You're finally getting some help
For that problem of yours--
Look, pinky, i'll explain this one more time. My appointment with dr.
Freud is only a ruse. When he tries to hypnotize me,
I will use a pair of mirrored glasses to reverse the process,
Thereby hypnotizing freud himself. Egad! Brilliant, brain!
Then you can make him wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey.
Pinky, how would that possibly help us
To take over the world?
Well, actually, i was thinking of it
More as entertainment. Poit.
All vienna knows that the emperor franz josef
Is being treated by freud for depression.
When freud is under my spell... unh! I will order him to hypnotize the emperor Into giving me, the brain,
His right to the imperial throne,
Allowing me to take over the world!
[Squeak] [plop] Uhh! Ooh!
They're right in here with all the fun, fun games
I brought to play with in the waiting room. Zort!
[Gasps] Oh, look.
I've got jacks and wind-Up toys
No! Don't leave me!
Well, what about all this stuff? Boring. Been there, done that.
Well, make small talk with that man over there
And give me my mirrored glasses.
Um...hi. Let's see. Um... do you know anything about lilliputians?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make small talk. Ach, don't trouble yourself.
I'm just a sad little sad man. Life brings me nothing but dreary sadness.
I'm sad all the time. Boy, am i sad.
Well, i brought a pair of googly-Eye glasses. They'll cheer you up.
Oogedy-Boogedy! Ha ha ha ha ha! Narf!
But all i see is my own dreary, sad little sad face.
Poit.
These aren't my googly-Eye glasses.
These are mirrored gla-- [Gasps]
Uh-Oh. You are getting sleepy... very sleepy.
No, no. You are getting sleepy.
[Boing] Hey, take off those ridiculous glasses.
Huh? Now, where were we? Ah, yes.
You are getting sleepy. Wait.
Pinky has my other glasses. I--I need them.
You don't need glasses to be hypnotized. Oh, yes. Really, i...
Have...to...get... them. I...
Yes.
Let yourself go.
Must remember to... hurt pinky at first opportunity.
No.
You don't want to hurt anybody. We are going to discover who hurt you. We are going back to your childhood.
Going back... back.
You are in a deep sleep, ja?
Ja.
I mean... yes. I want you to think about a time When you were very young.
Freud: where you are, brain? Brain:
in a field, playing. How old are you? Just a child,
Not a care in the world.
[Grunts]
[Snap] [Clatter]
[Grunts]
Suddenly i'm being chased,
Hunted down like some sort of rabid dog.
Terrified, i run home to my parents.
They rush to my aid, But my assailant is overpowering. I was taken from my home
And sent to a research facility.
As i entered those doors, The carefree innocence of my youth
Was snuffed out like a candle,
Replaced with unremitting darkness. Lab-Coated goons tried to break our spirits And brainwash us into submission.
Others emerged from the experience... not quite all there.
Narf! Zort! Hee hee hee hee!
The slightest insolence resulted in punishment Both swift and brutal.
[Mice gasp] More? You want more?
Aah.
Aah!
I never met a man i didn't meet.
Aah!
The problem with congress is... they're all liars.
Aah! Make it stop!
And how did that make you feel?
Angry... like i wanted to... to take over the world.
Hmm. Emotional displacement. Obviously, you were missing the comfort of your home.
It's... a tin can.
There's something on the side of it, a... a picture.
No. No. I--I mean, i--I can't tell.
It's a picture of... of... the world! And then they dragged me away. And you want your world back.
It's simple. Yes. [Snap] what?
Where am i? Your problem is simple, herr brain. You just want to go home.
I don't? I don't? [Click] ok, time's up.
"how to hypnotize anyone.
Create a relaxing atmosphere."
Okey-Dokey, you sick little puppy. Move it. I got another client.
Oh, there's not enough time for this.
[Smack] oh!
Oh, no. What have i done?
Oh, no. What have i done? Yes!
You'll obey my every command. I will obey.
Is nothing but cheap nostalgia.
Maybe all i'm really longing for is... is... a rusty tin can.
What a quack. Ha ha ha ha ha! Narf!
Oh, very good, mr. Elephant. Zort!
Ach, herr pinky, i'm having the most exciting fun
For the first time in my dreary, sad life. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Narf! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
I will hypnotize the emperor franz josef And order him to make brain his successor.
Perfect. When i snap my fingers, you will awaken.
[Snap]
Ach!
Herr brain, it's late.
You made good progress today.
More than you know, doctor.
Oh, come over any time, herr pinky.
Here is meine card.
Auf wiedersehen. Gesundheit! Who's your new friend, pinky?
"His most imperial emperor franz josef"?
Pinky, that's the man i wanted freud to hypnotize.
Oh, he doesn't want to be hypnotized now, brain.
Since i taught him all my favorite games, He says he'll never need therapy again.
I believe i need therapy, pinky, To find out why i hang around with a nut like you.
Come. We must go back to the lab
And prepare for tomorrow night. Why, brain? What are we going to do tomorrow night?
Try to shrink your head? No, pinky,
The same thing we do every night, No matter how forcefully the purveyors of psychobabble
Attempt to dissuade us-- Try to take over the world!
♪ they're dinky ♪ ♪ they're pinky and the brain ♪
♪ brain, brain, brain, brain ♪
Assuming a standard height-To-Weight ratio
And a 3-Point margin of error... pinky: ha ha ha ha!
[Synthetic laughter] Factor in g-Force and wind shear
Of each downward thrust... ha ha ha ha!
[Synthetic laughter] That does it!
Pinky, what are you doing? Ha ha ha! Oh, poit!
I'm playing With my new "tickle me herbert" doll, brain. You just tickle him here,
And he laughs and laughs. Kootchie kootchie kootchie! [Synthetic laughter]
Well, put it away.
I can hardly hear myself think.
Maybe you're just not thinking loud enough, brain. Pinky, may i see that for a moment?
Sure--Uhh!
[Synthetic laughter] [Laughter fades]
Oh, brain, i think he likes you.
Zort!
Now maybe i'll have the quiet i need
To finish perfecting my latest plan.
You might say we're going fishing.
And all the stuff you need for keeping bees.
That's not fishing. Ha!
Oh, that's skiing. Try to focus, pinky.
This is the finnious japonicus,
Commonly known in japan as mugu.
One bite of its tail renders anyone who eats it
Unable to move for 24 hours.
I had a linoleum sandwich last week That made me feel the same way, But shiny.
And place it over your mouth. [Muffled] ok.
My plan is simply this--
I will capture a pair of mugu, breed them, And market the tails throughout the world As cappy brain's frozen fish sticks.
While the populace is immobilized,
I shall implement my plan of world domination. There's only one catch.
Oh?
Well, that won't be enough To feed the whole world, then, will it?
[Muffled] sorry. The japonicus is so rare
That the only known specimens
Are those bred in captivity For the dining pleasure of japan's most elite sumo wrestlers.
[Muffled question]
If you're going to speak, pinky. Oh.
[Muffled question] I have anticipated your query, pinky.
I plan to become One of japan's most elite sumo wrestlers. Observe.
Narf!
[Gasps] The "tickle me dom deluise"?
Oh, why, that's the most expensive one.
Look closer, pinky.
To fit the precise specifications
Of a champion sumo wrestler.
With the adjustments i've made,
I'll be able to flip a 600-Pound man.
Won't you need an awfully large spatula for that?
Don't forget to pack your doll
When we go to japan, pinky.
I might feel the need
Noogie. Give him the noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie. Unh!
Good work, tomu-San. Tomorrow we work on the wedgie. Now go.
Brain: master hama? Yes?
Allow me to introduce myself. I am the brain.
I have come many miles with my small valet pinky
To study sumo at the camp of master hama.
Your head is as small as a lychee nut,
But your physique is excellent for sumo.
I would be honored to teach you.
Actually, i am but an insignificant lab mouse
Attempting to take over the world. The honor is all mine. [Clank]
Whaa! Whoa! [Crash]
There is no need for false humility And groveling. Come.
We begin immediately. Let us begin our first lesson.
Excellent.
Who do i flip first? Patience, brain-San.
When you are more advanced.
Today, we consider the pebble.
Consider the pebble?
Zen exercise to increase concentration.
Observe the pebble's simplicity. Listen to its silence.
Become the pebble. You want me to stare at a rock all day?
Just until lunchtime.
See you in 4 hours.
Hama thinks i'm a beginner, pinky. Until he lets me compete
With advanced wrestlers, I'll never get access to the mugu.
Pinky?
I was becoming one with the pebble.
Were you? Yes.
And it's really easy.
All you have to do is make your mind a complete blank.
Too bad drawing a blank isn't an olympic event, pinky.
We could retire on the gold medals you'd win.
Eat well, brain-San. We have much training left to do.
Aren't you hungry, master hama? No.
I eat big lunch with my star wrestlers In other dining hall--
Fried mugu, cajun mugu, mugu chowder, mojo mugu.
Perhaps you will be allowed to eat mugu, too, eh?
Sooner than you think, my pan-Pacific friend.
The sumo men must eat a lot to get so fat.
Wrestlers not fat, pinky-San. It is muscle tissue
Resulting from years of strenuous yoga exercises. [Door opens] Who wants pie?
Pinky, a day has passed, And we have nothing to show for it.
Oh, i don't know, brain. I've developed a lovely relationship With our new friend the pebble.
Pinky, have you ever contemplated the sound of one hand bopping?
One hand, um... don't think so.
Aah! [Crowd chattering in distance]
What's going on?
It is matsuhisa, the best wrestler in camp. He has had too much pie
And is taking on all challengers. Grrr! Pinky: egad, brain.
To beat that matsu hoozy fellow.
Pinky, are you pondering what i'm pondering?
I think so, brain,
But who wants to see Snow white and the seven samurai?
No, pinky.
I will defeat the great matsuhisa, Thereby proving That i am a great sumo wrestler.
Matsuhisa, i will accept your challenge. What's going on here?
Brain-San has gone completely insane. Hmm, oh, that would explain
[Grunting]
Oof! Quit now, brain-San.
Better to be live coward than dead idiot.
Don't worry, hama. It's a matter of scientific fact
That i can flip any man up to 600 pounds. Matsuhisa weighs 601 pounds.
Noogie, noogie, noogie. Ow!
Stop hurting brain, you, you pie wrecker!
[Grunts] whoa!
[Crash]
[Boing]
Whaa!
[Grunts]
Kootchie kootchie.
[Laughing] Kootchie kootchie kootchie.
Poit. Kootchie kootchie koo. Zort!
Kootchie koo. Kootchie poit!
[Crowd gasps]
Whaa ha ha ha! Whoa ho ho ho!
Whoa! Whoa! Oof!
[Cheering] The winner! Narf!
Pinky: ooh, now we can get into the fancy restaurant, brain.
And we'll get ahold of the fancy fish. This way, pinky.
This is it, pinky. The world's only specimens of finnious japonicus
Are in this tank. Soon, kitchen freezers throughout the world Will be stocked with cappy brain's delicious mugu tails,
You put the yum in yum-Yum-Yummy, cappy brain. Zort!
[Both grunt] Tell me if you see any movement, pinky.
Pinky: um, think i saw some movement just then, brain.
Perhaps i should have researched the size of the mugu
A bit more thoroughly.
What do we do now, cappy brain? Hope the chef pushes the mugu, pinky,
And plan for tomorrow night. Why?
What are we going to do tomorrow night, brain? Same thing we do every night, pinky--
Dry off, and then
Try to take over the world.

NO, PINKY.
NEEK. YOUR HAT.

IT'S THE MINIATURE PROTOTYPE FOR MY GREATEST STROKE OF GENIUS, PINKY.

[REFINED] I MEAN, NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE.
HOW VERY FLATTERING.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, BILLIE. WE HAVE IMPORTANT LABORS TO ATTEND TO.
[SQUAWKY] YOU MEAN, TAKING OVER THE WORLD IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN... ME?
NOW, DON'T GET ALL MALLEABLE ON ME.
YOU ALWAYS KNEW WORK CAME FIRST.
YES. THAT'S WHY I LEFT YOU FOR SNOWBALL.
DON'T SAY THAT NAME.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES TO ME.
SORRY, EGGIE. I FORGOT.
BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I'VE LEFT SNO--HIM.
AND NOW I NEED YOUR HELP.
YES, WELL, IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, GET YOURSELF A GUMSHOE.
OR AT LEAST A REALLY STICKY HAT.
Brain: I HATED BEING TOUGH ON THE OLD GIRL, BUT I WAS A MOUSE ON A MISSION,
Brain: CORRECTION.
NO ONE ELSE WAS GOING TO GET IN MY WAY. Billie:
AAH! HELP!
HELP, EGGHEAD!
HELP! HELP!
PINKY, IT'S BILLIE.
SHE REALLY IS IN A PICKLE.
OH. DILL OR SWEET?
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
WHY DIDN'T I HELP HER?
WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TIME SHE R-R-R-RIPPED OUT YOUR FRAGILE HEART, THEN SMASHED IT INTO MILLIONS OF TINY LITTLE PIECES.
YES. THANK YOU, PINKY.
YES, AND THEN SQU-U-U-I-I-ISHED THEM ALL UP AND GROUND THEM INTO PATÈ.
I GET THE PICTURE!
OH, AND THEN SHE LEFT YOU
FOR THAT GERBIL-Y FELLOW CALLED--
Snowball: SNOWBALL.
I TOLD YOU NEVER TO SAY THAT NAME!
I DIDN'T SAY IT, BRAIN.
THEN WHO... DID?
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! OH, I'M SORRY, BRAIN. BUT I DO SO LOVE IT
WHEN YOU WAIL PATHETICALLY. AND NOW THAT BILLIE IS MINE AGAIN, I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE DOING NOTHING BUT WAILING.
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
BRAIN GETS TERRIBLY SEASICK.
YOU DIRTY... HAMSTER!
LET BILLIE GO OR I'LL--
HEADS.
TOUGH LUCK, BRAIN.
MAYBE YOU CAN TRY FOR 2 OUT OF 3.
BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN.
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE PLAY THE GAME, I ALWAYS WIN.
WELL, I'LL GIVE MY REGARDS TO BILLIE FOR YOU.
TOODLE-OO, OLD CHUMP.
G'BYE, SNOWBALL.
BE SURE TO CALL AGAIN SOON!
DON'T BE SHY! DROP BY ANY TI--AAH!
TO COIN A PHRASE... OUCH.
Brain: BILLIE NEEDED ME,
SO, PUTTING MY PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION ON HIATUS, WE HASTENED TO THE PALATIAL ABODE OF MY NEMESIS.
Pinky: YOU MEAN WE HOT-FOOTED IT TO THE HAMSTER'S JOINT?
Brain: CLAM UP, PINKY.
THE HAMSTER LIVED IN ONE OF THOSE $30,000 SPANISH-STYLE MEDIEVAL CASTLES THAT EVERYONE WAS SO NUTS ABOUT A FEW YEARS BACK.
NOW, KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR CLUES.
DO THEY MAKE A SPECIAL UTENSIL FOR THAT, BRAIN?
NO, PINKY, BUT I BELIEVE THEY DO MAKE A MOUTH CLAMP.
WHY DON'T YOU USE IT?
IT'S BILLIE, PINKY!
WE MUST MAKE HASTE!
YOU MEAN, "GET THE LARD OUT, CHUMP"? WHAA!
Brain: IT CAN'T BE!
PINKY, THE HAMSTER HAS PURLOINED OUR DESIGNS FOR THE FEDOR-A-MATIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? OOOH!
I'LL GET ANOTHER TIGHT, TINGLY HAT?
NO, PINKY.
A SLIGHTLY SNUG SOMBRERO?
NO!
MILDLY UNCOMFORTABLE LEDERHOSEN?
NOT ONLY HAS THE HAMSTER STOLEN BILLIE, HE WANTS TO STEAL THE WORLD!
NO!
[GRUNTING] PINKY... HELP!
MY HAT IS STUCK.
ALWAYS THE LUCKY ONE, AREN'T YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HAT?
AHH! LOOK, BRAIN!
A WHOLE GAGGLE OF HATS.
PINKY, WHERE ARE YOU?
THIS ONE'S RATHER RAKISH. HOO HOO.
BRAIN? WHERE ARE YOU?
HOW DO I MAKE IT TIGHT?
OH, THE IRONY OF IT ALL.
HOISTED BY MY OWN FEDOR-A-MATIC.
BRAIN! THE WORLD!
THE WORLD CAN WAI--OOF!
THERE YOU ARE, BRAIN.
BAD FOR GLASS! BAD FOR GLASS!
BAD FOR BRAIN.
ALL MY SUFFERING WAS FOR NAUGHT, PINKY.
WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE CLUE TO FOLLOW.
DOES THAT MEAN THIS GROCERY LIST I FOUND IN MY HAT ISN'T A CLUE?
"THINGS TO DO."
[READING]
"BRIBE CITY COUNCIL"?
-TYPE THEME] Pinky: THIS IS THE CITY-- UM...
I MEAN, THIS IS THE CITY HALL!
BUT YOU CAN'T SELL OFF THE WATER RIGHTS.
I NEED WATER FOR MY ARUGULA!
AND I NEED WATER FOR MY KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM PLANTATION.
I NEED WATER FOR MY MR. WIGGLY-WOGGLY HOSEY THINGY DINGY DERE!
SORRY, BUT THE WATER RIGHTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED.
MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
JIMINY! I ALWAYS WANTED A CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT DECODER RING!
I'LL SAY! THIS IS SWELL!
PINKY, ARE YOU PONDERING WHAT I'M PONDERING?
I THINK SO, BRAIN, BUT IF WE GET SAM SPAYED,
WE'LL NEVER HAVE ANY PUPPIES.
NO, PINKY.
SOMEONE HAS ALREADY BRIBED THE COUNCIL FOR THE WATER RIGHTS.
YOU MEAN...
DON'T SAY IT, PINKY.
WEE WILLIE WINKIE?
NO, PINKY.
Snowball:
TOO LATE AGAIN, BRAIN.
PPPBBBBLLTTT!
AFTER HIM, PINKY!
I NEED WATER FOR MY ELEPHANTS! OW!
WE'RE IN LUCK!
TAXI!
TAX--EEEGH!
FOLLOW THAT CAR!
YES! THIS IS A PAIN THAT IS MOST PROMISING.
EGAD! IT'S ASTOUNDING, BRAIN.
THAT I AM PLIANT ENOUGH TO SURVIVE SUCH CALAMITY?
NOOO! THAT YOU ACTUALLY FOUND A CAB IN L.A. NATCH!
Brain:
WE GOT TO THE RESERVOIR WITHOUT A MOMENT TO LOSE. Pinky:
AND THERE WERE 3 BOWLS OF PORRIDGE.
AND I SAID, "MY, GRANDMA.
WHAT BIG, SWOLLEN ANKLES YOU HAVE."
Brain: STOW IT, PINKY.
COME ON, PINKY.
IT'S NOT AS HARD AS IT LOOKS. ARGH!
YOU JUST GET A LITTLE-- [RIPPING] YAAH! SCRAPED UP, THAT'S-- [RIPPING]
PINKY!
PINKY, HURRY UP!
RIGHT HERE, BRAIN. NATCH!
OH, WELL, SURE!
YOU CAN TAKE THE EASY WAY!
Man with Polish accent: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, MOUSEY MOUSE.
YOU'RE A VERY NOSY FELLA, MOUSEY MOUSE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO NOSY FELLAS, HMM?
HUH? DO YOU? HMM?
THIS!
GEE, I NEVER THINK TO CARRY AN UMBRELLA IN LOS ANGELES. GAAAH!
EGAD!
I'LL SAVE YOU, BRAIN!
UM, BRAIN, BEFORE I SAVE YOU, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TEACH ME TO SWIM?
WITH ALL THAT AIR IN YOUR HEAD, IT'S A WONDER YOU DON'T FLOAT.
WHOO-HOO! THAT WAS ALMOST AS THRILLING AS OUR SWIRLING WHIRLPOOL OF FUN
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING IN THE TOILET AGAIN, HAVEN'T YOU, PINKY?
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL...
NO! IT CAN'T BE!
PINKY, WE'RE TOO LATE.
THE FEDOR-A-MATIC HAS BEEN BUILT!
OOH, JOY!
TIGHT HAT CITY, HERE WE COME!
TOP OF THE WORLD, BRAIN.
CARE TO TIP YOUR HAT TO MY ACCOMPLISHMENT WHILE YOU STILL CAN? HA HA HA HA HA!
AFTER HIM, PINKY.
HE'S ABOUT TO ENGAGE THE MACHINE.
POIT! I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE GOING STEADY.
WE REALLY OUGHT TO BRING A GIFT, BRAIN--HWACK!
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE REGISTERED?
CONGRATULATIONS, SNOWBALL!
WE'RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR FIANCEE!
A HAMSTER ENGAGED TO A BIG MACHINE?
WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY?
Brain: STOP BEING FOOLISH, PINKY.
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, BRAIN.
AS LONG AS THEY'RE HAPPY.
WE SHOULD GET THEM SOMETHING NICE.
A FONDUE SET, MAYBE. I MEAN, AFTER ALL, WE ARE GETTING TIGHT HATS IN THE BARGAIN.
I'LL STOP YOU NOW.
NO!
IT CAN'T BE!
EGAD, BRAIN!
SNOWBALL'S TURNED INTO A MOUSE!
NO, PINKY. IT'S BILLIE.
BILLIE'S TURNED INTO A HAMSTER?
NYEH! SHE'S A MOUSE!
SHE'S A HAMSTER!
SHE'S A MOUSE!
SHE'S A HAMSTER!
SHE'S A MOUSE AND A HAMSTER? [SOBBING]
YES, EGGIE, IT IS I.
BUT... BUT WHY?
Snowball: BECAUSE SHE LOVES ME.
YES, BRAIN, IT WAS ALL A RUSE,
DESIGNED TO DISTRACT YOU LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO STEAL YOUR PLANS AND EXECUTE THEM.
AND EXECUTE ME IN THE PROCESS.
DON'T BE SILLY, BRAIN.
IT WOULD TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF LIFE.
I DERIVE MY GREATEST PLEASURE FROM MAKING YOU SQUIRM.
I DERIVE MY GREATEST PLEASURE FROM MAKING BRAIN SQUIRT MILK OUT OF HIS NOSE. NATCH!
HA HA HA HA! Billie: STOP THAT!
SNOWBALL WASN'T TRYING TO GET RID OF YOU, EGGHEAD. I WAS!
WHAT?
I'M SORRY, EGGIE, BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE, I'LL NEVER REALLY HAVE THE THING I WANT MOST.
THE WORLD?
NO.
ME.
GUESS AGAIN.
WHAT?
PUT ME DOWN, YOU GOON.
SORRY, SNOWY.
I WAS JUST USING YOU TO GET THE WATER RIGHTS.
BESIDES, YOU NEVER COULD ACCEPT ME FOR WHAT I AM, MAKING ME TAKE VOICE LESSONS AND ALL.
AND YOU, EGGIE, YOU LOVE THE WORLD TOO MUCH TO EVER REALLY CARE ABOUT ME.
SORRY, BUT NEITHER OF YOU WILL EVER HOLD A CANDLE TO MY ONE TRUE LOVE.
PINKY...
PINKY? !
PINKY? ! I'VE BEEN PLAYED LIKE A TUNELESS FIDDLE AT A HOEDOWN.
CARE TO DO THE HOKEY-POKEY?
PINKY, I BUILT THIS FOR YOU.
I HOPE YA LIKE IT.
EGAD! MY OWN FEDOR-A-MATIC?
NO, MY DARLING!
A GIANT WATER PARK! WITH SLIPPERY SLIDES AND BUMPER BOATS!
OOOH, BRAIN! CAN WE RIDE THE BUMPER BOATS?
CAN WE?
CAN WE, PLEE-EE-EE-EASE?
YOU DON'T NEED BRAIN'S PERMISSION, PINKY.
I DON'T? NO!
YOUR DAYS OF BEING BOPPED ON THE HEAD
AND KOWTOWING TO BRAIN'S EVERY WHIM ARE OVER!
THEY ARE? YES!
BOYS?
GEE, THAT LOOKS LIKE KICKS, GOONY-GOON.
ALONE AT LAST!
HA HA HA HA! OH, YOU'RE NOT ALONE, BILLIE.
I'M HERE!
AND NOW I CAN GIVE YOU THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL.
A HAT SQUISHED DOWN ALL TINGLY-WINGLY AROUND MY HEAD?
NO, SILLY!
ME!
WELL... WHAT DO YA THINK?
YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER MY WORLD, BIG BOY?
UM, ER, UH, UH,
I--I--I--I--I-- I'LL HAVE TO ASK BRAIN IF IT'S OK.
HE WAS SOME KIND OF A MOUSE.
HEY, DAD, WHAT'S THAT?
THE WORLD'S FIRST WATER PARK.
IT SURE LOOKS SWELL.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
Brain, voice-over: WELL, THIS IS WHERE YOU CAME IN-- WITH ME IN THE DRINK LIKE SOMEBODY'S DIRTY LAUNDRY.
Pinky, voice-over: OOH! I HOPE THEY SEPARATED THE UNDERGARMENTS.
COME, PINKY.
WE MUST TOWEL OFF AND PREPARE FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.
GEE, BRAIN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TOMORROW NIGHT,
CONSTRUCT A MACHINE TO MAKE OUR PANTS REALLY TIGHT?
NO, PINKY.
THE SAME THING WE DO EVERY NIGHT--
TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
Snowball: IF I DON'T BEAT YOU TO IT.
GET YOUR HAND OFF OF ME, YOU DAMP, HAIRY HAMSTER!
AS YOU WISH.
* THEY'RE DINKY, THEY'RE PINKY *
* AND THE BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN, BRAIN *
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- Step right up Ladies and gentlemen!
An evening filled with excitement awaits you
- There's no TV
people need entertainment
- A gala?
- A gala
- A gala
- "Death Hammer"
- Put everything exactly back where you got it
If he notices anything, we're done for
- CorbeiI, we have a problem
- help me!
- blanche?
tell me who killed you, who killed Dr What's going on with the TV
- What we've been seeing on TV, logically, must have come from the mind of blanche Von Trieck
- Except that she's dead
- You must have some idea?
- It has to be someone who knows my research
Those guys are scattered all over the world
Except LefIaguais who's dead
A signal
- LefIaguais
- We'II locate the transmitter
No, no, no!
- What?
The TV again?
- Goddamnit
- Biron!
Wait!
Nobody knows you searched the safe If you've put everything back, it's all good
- Yeah, yeah
- The old woman appeared to me when I was in the ring
She gave me another clue:
"The last victim will act as a compass"
- That's all fine and dandy Lapointe but I've got documents in the car
- Did you read them?
- No, I'm going to right now
- Shit, Biron!
Do you have a record?
- What?
- A criminal record? - Why?
- Fingerprints!
- Never mind
- I didn't know a little "home-made" alcohol in the bottles would make them sick
If they didn't drink so much in the first place
Now two of them have stomach cancer but it's not my fault
- hold on Buddy:
I think some of them have two words for you - Come on guys, you know me better than that
I never did that
well, well, look who we have here
- I didn't want to lose custody of the kid
I'm the one who put the naked children's photos in his things
I just wanted
- Oh my God!
- That's enough
- Pierre
- Go back home
I'II talk to you tomorrow
Let's meet again, same place
- Same time
- No, Iet's say noon
- Sarah, go back to bed
Armand!
Go away, you're drunk
- I'm not drunk
- You've already woken up Sarah
- I'm leaving tomorrow
I've come to say goodbye
- I'm leaving too
- You're leaving?
- I've lost everyone I Ioved in Great Bear - Not me;
I'm still here and
Stephanie I'm drunk
Take me with you
- Go away
You're hurting me
Again - people change Stephanie
I've changed and I'II change again, OK?
And what the old woman said isn't true
I didn't betray you by working with your father
I betrayed myself
For you
- I need a straighter and stronger man than that
- You can't do that
Stephanie, open the door
You want to know something?
Do you?
Open up and I'II tell you who killed your mother
Who and why and how
- What? You knew?
- well
- You knew?
- well
I don't want to hear it!
- What's going on?
- Stephanie,
Sarah can show you what you want to know
- Go ahead, Stephanie
- Christian
Where are we going?
- It's gonna hurt at first but it's about time someone opened your eyes about Dad and your sister
It's almost over Mom
That big dumb-ass
- This isn't right, it isn't right
- Who fired?
- Who's with you?
- I'm with Mom
- Suzanne!
- almost over almost over
- I'd take money in my register every time
I was doing my job
- Everything's in its place
Wait
BeIiveau, the copier is warm
- Shit! I'II be right there
- "The last victim will act as a compass
Him?
- congratulations
- Thanks
I'm sorry about what happened to blanche and your wife
- blanche said you'd come and talk to me about this
- I thought blanche's stories
- Some days I manage not to believe them
- Want some?
- You lost your wife too, eh?
- Yeah
- So, what was it you wanted to tell me?
- I don't really know
I thought maybe you could help me with my investigation or to understand why blanche chose me, why I'm here
Forget it
- Look, BIanche would probably tell you that the answer is right before your eyes
- Thanks
As far as compass goes, doesn't get any better
- I had to come
- That's OK, I'm glad you're here
- I'm sorry about this afternoon
- I don't want you to explain, Catherine
You asked me before if I believe it's possible to start over
well now, with you, I think I couId
- What's going on?
- The whole town is blabbing on TV
One scandal after another
They take turns beating on each other
Nothing very interesting
- Hey, Moron
That's you on TV
- We're real good friends
- I'm exhausted
- Why don't I escort you to your bed?
- No, with you, I forget everything;
I don't feel as tired
- I didn't say we'd sleep
- Not my place, not now
- It's "Badaboom" Mrs
Badaboom was more than his dog
I
I didn't see him
I ran him over
- Badaboom?
That was you, Moron?
- Yes
- Badaboom?
But why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't, I felt so bad
- Come here
Forget about it
Badaboom would have wanted it that way
- Yeah, OK
- Those documents don't exist anymore, eh, BeIiveau?
- I kept them - I know why you kept them Because you're afraid of me
A real female
I misjudged you
I'm willing to bet that journalist had something to do with this
- Lapointe?
No, he - Not Lapointe
Biron Lapointe wouldn't have left prints all over the place
Check if they match Biron's file and we have to find him right now
Send someone to the hydroplanes
There's only one road leading out of Great Bear, right?
- olson Road to the forty-four About a hundred miles in the woods
- I'II put up a roadblock
If this gets out, do you realize how much shit we'II be in because of you?
They'II be looking for a scapegoat and I'm not going down alone,
- Yes Sir
I'II be there as soon as I can
Yes
If I'm there tomorrow, I'II be on Lapointe's TV show
This is big Simone, bigger than the Lambert case;
- It's your turn EmiIe
What the Lambert case did for Lapointe's career, this scoop will do for yours, Honey
- But
Lapointe; do you really think
- You think he would have shared the spotlight on a case like this?
- Don't rely on appearances
Lapointe is a bit harsh sometimes but deep down he's a good guy
- emile, without that scoop, his career is over
- That's why it wouId be a rotten thing to
- He might be a good guy but he'II take all the credit because he can't afford not to
Don't you get it?
They sent him to Great Bear to get rid of him, he said so himself
- I don't know
- emile
You're just a pawn to him
What do you think's gonna happen if you show up there together?
It'II be: "hello Lapointe!
Leave your shadow in the coatroom"
- Hey
I led the investigation into the Iumberjacks
That's my doing
- That's all I'm saying, Kitten
It's your turn
- It's about time I got out of here
- Biron
Biron?
He probably thought this would be the first place the cops would come looking for him
The key is at the front desk
- Coast is clear, they're gone
- You're booking me?
- Hurry up, he can't be far
- What's the motive?
- We'II deal with it at the station
- They must have the hydroplanes under surveillance
I can't take the road
- I have an idea
- Did you find him? - No
- I want my lawyer!
- Miss, I apologize for the brief delay, but be assured that
I want my lawyer!
- What lawyer?
- hello What?
- Did you see what's on TV?
- I don't watch TV anymore
- I'm sure it wouId cheer you up
- There's only one thing that would cheer me up
- Does this make my ass look fat?
- hello?
Hi Gastonne, how are you doing?
- How am "I" doing?
well
We emptied the place and filled up the hospital
Where are you?
- Somewhere safe
- What did you find?
Is my father involved?
Be honest
- No
- No?
- I mean I didn't find anything compromising on anybody
I don't think I took the right documents
- Shit!
- I know
- It's still breaking and entering
- I can't talk to you
The cops are here
- OK, don't move EmiIe
- I can't do this
- Come on EmiIe, it'II grow back
- But my pride won't
- What does that mean?
- Look at me
I just lied to my best friend
I'm betraying Lapointe I'm lying to my childhood idol for God's sake!
- emile, don't start this again
- I won't start again
I swear I won't start again
- Kitten
- HeIène
We found him
- My husband?
- He's in the hospital
Get dressed, I'II
Biron
- Hey!
This is Georges Ferron!
Hurry up and find him a room He paid for this hospital
- It's all right Christian
It wasn't a heart attack, just a little warning
- A heart attack?
You told me
- It's nothing; she just told you
- But Dad
- Make a man of yourself!
- Yeah, yeah
- How's our business going?
- Dove will be here this morning, with the money
She's already taken a liking to me
We'II do it in broad daylight
She'II be a friend of mine visiting
We make the trade, no hassle;
she sleeps at the hotel, no worries
- Did you think of that yourself?
- Sure did!
I even arranged a surprise reunion with an old friend of hers
- What did I tell you about Armand?
He's not worth
- Not worth it?
Armand's share is twenty thousand bucks!
- What do you do if she shoots him in the middle of the street?
- No, she doesn't suspect a thing
Got her wrapped around my little finger
Guaranteed
Armand!
Armand!
Open up
hold me
- How's it going?
We can do this another day if you want; I'm in no hurry
- If you made me come over here to see me abandoned and miserable; go ahead, take a good look
- No is an unexpected pleasure
- What are you doing here if you haven't done anything?
- You have no scruples getting murderers off, but the innocent
- If you have to whip me some more
I told you, I'm sorry about your wife, and I regret getting the guy off
- AII right, all right
I believe you
- What?
- I forgive you
- You say that because the bars keep you from strangling me?
I'm not doing it for you;
If you only knew how much better I feel, not hating you
- I can believe that
OK
- actually, they don't want me; it's Biron they're after
- Biron?
Why?
- They think he's got compromising documents
- Compromising for who?
- For national Security Why, I don't know yet but it has to do with the helicopter accident that killed the Iumberjacks ten years ago
- That ugly statue in front?
- Yeah, that's it In fact, they have no intentions of letting me go until they have Biron and the documents
- OK, so what am I doing here?
- You play along but
while they were interrogating me, I overheard some info:
listen At ten o'cIock sharp
- WouIdn't it be better to tell them to send backup?
- If they learn what's going on, not only do I lose the case I've dedicated my Iife to, but you'II lose your eyes, ears and what's left of your balls; in that order
In eight seconds
special Agent CorbeiI, colonel
Edouard Paquette and Robert BeIiveau are also present
I'm fully aware this is a delicate case, but I have the situation under control
Paquette and BeIiveau can testify to it
- Yes
- blanche Von Trieck's murderer is someone who has a high caliber scientific formation and who has been in contact with Professor Paquette's research
He succeeded in reproducing and improving the technology developed by Paquette
He was able to make a copy of his victim's brain
AvirtuaI copy
- A copy of her brain - That's what they said but I don't have all the details
- glad to run into you
- I have to be somewhere but I'II be back later
But I'm warning you Biron;
I'm leaving Great Bear tomorrow
- Come on Armand
Lapointe - Lapointe, follow the constable: you're free to go
- Come on Lapointe
- Don't worry Biron, we'II get you out of here
- well, I sure hope so!
Gastonne, Gastonne you can't leave me here
- That's not so bad, all they have on you is driving under the influence
You'II end up with three months and community service, maximum
- No, Gastonne I lied to you
I did read the documents
They'II want to kill me, I swear!
They already have killed a dozen others;
- What were those papers?
- Your friend Biron didn't tell you?
- He didn't read them
Anyway, I want to hear it from you
What happened to the Iumberjacks?
Of course: you never trusted me
You're not about to start today
- You want me to trust you but - Yes
- Can you keep a secret?
It wasn't supposed to be that way
They asked me for twelve guys, preferably unemployed, with no wives, no kids
- No future
- I ran an ad:
"Dangerous job, lots of quick money"
I knew exactly who would show up
Before they got on the helicopter,
CorbeiI offered them five times their pay if they agreed to participate in an experiment
They all signed up
Sam first
After a few days, I went up to see what was going on
The guys had lost their minds
When I got a hold of Sam
Come on!
Come on Sam!
Sam, Sam, listen Listen Sam
You have to get out of here while you still got cells!
- still got cells
- Go on!
Then they arranged for the accident
- And you didn't say anything
- No!
Are you insane?
You have to help me Gastonne
Do this for your father
If all this gets out
- "still got cells";
that's the sentence which got us started on the right track
- Yes, I know
I liked Sam
You see where feelings get you?
You always say I have a heart of stone
But I got Sam out; that proves
please, don't make me regret the only time I followed my heart
- You already regret it
You can't turn your father in
help me
You're a cop Dad
You're supposed to protect people
- You're the only person I can count on
- You say I'm not a good cop
Take a look at yourself
- They'II lock me up for the rest of my Iife For a mistake that, even if I wanted to, I can't fix
- I'II think about it
- Thanks
Listen and the bar are yours but
- relax Dove
I have a surprise you're gonna like
- Oh yeah?
- There you are!
Give me my money and then: adios
Dove?
- hello Armand
- Surprise!
- Christian
- Give me my bag - Do what you want with him, but not here, OK?
- I said give me my bag, now!
Armand!
We can finally settle this
Look at me!
- please
- Here
This is all I wrote you since
half are love letters, half are death threats:
they're for you
- Why?
- Because it took a Iong time but
I want nothing to do with you
Nothing with your love, nothing with your death
They're yours
- You knew I was here?
- You're the only one who called me Dove
- Dove, you know
- Kiss me
Kiss me one last time, then Goodbye
- Goodbye
- Stef, put that down
- Who is she?
- This is Dove: my ex
- That's right, I am his ex
- I'm sure it's true
Funny how easy it is to get the truth when you're holding this eh?
Funny
I should have tried this before eh?
I would have known a Iot faster that you led Mom to her death
- Who told you
You know I didn't want to hurt her
I just wanted her to know
- Don't swear in front of me
- I would have told you but Dad
- What you told me was that you don't ever want me to try to help you
Count on me
I don't think there's anything left for me to know, right?
unless there's something else you're hiding, eh Armand?
- careful
- I wasn't talking to you
She seems to know what she's talking about eh?
Is that what excites you?
A chick with a gun?
Am I turning you on, Armand?
- Stef
- What are you waiting for?
Don't you see she's crazy about you?
- Not loaded?
You know, I really do like you
- So, are you going to show me your big - That's right, I am his ex.
- Here, didn't you ordered this?
- Yes
- I haven't felt like this in so long
I mean, I'm with you but
- Goes back a Iong way
- Yeah AII this time, I thought the clues from blanche were leading me to a criminal
When in reality, they were leading me to you
Doesn't matter
hello?
- Lapointe?
- Yes
- blanche's killer it's Catherine
Lapointe?
It's Catherine! It's Catherine
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- Sophie!
- Here
I don't know the meaning of these sentences but I know they will help you, one by one, to save my soul
- Georges, your son is completely stoned
- I have a feeling we'II get along, you and I, Christian
- There's no doubt
The waves producing the images on TV are of identical nature to the ones I was obtaining with my device, ten years ago
- I did things I would never do with him
I just want him back, BIanche
- HeIène, HeIène
- Who could be doing that?
AII of my ex-coIIaborators have been contacted, it's beyond me
- Don't you find that strange?
A neurologist to fix a TV signal problem?
- If there's a link between the two stories, we have a hell of a scoop
The only concrete facts we have are the article about Edouard Paquette found in Doctor Mondoux's hand and the missing file on the Iumberjacks
- If the documents aren't there, he decided it
- We have to open BeIiveau's safe
- The problem is that he's the only one who has the key
And he always keeps it on him
- You wanted Louis-Bernard Lapointe for your gala?
You shall have him
- Out of the question!
- Marcoux
tell Gastonne that Marcoux
She has to find Marcoux
tell Biron that blanche's book is not blanche's book
Did you look? - No
- tell me
- No
- You'II pay for this
- Maryse!
- You looked? - Maryse!
- Why did you look?
You'II pay for this
- Maryse! - You looked!
You looked!
- Pierre! Pierre!
hold him
Attention everyone!
Don't miss tonight, the first ever Super gala of Great Bear
- Hand me that microphone
A one of a kind boxing Iine-up featuring the one and only "Death Hammer"
- Jean-Guy Poitras
You'II get fights, special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
Attention everyone!
Don't miss tonight, the first ever Super gala of Great Bear
- HeIène Marcoux?
special Agent CorbeiI
- Dear God, have you found my husband?
- please follow me
- And then I run, I jump in my car and I drive with the pedal to the metal
- Biron
- Wait, wait, wait!
And then, I come back just in time
What do you think Louis?
- Since when are we on first-name basis?
- well, since yesterday I think
- Wait a minute
OK;
I had warned you but you didn't listen to me
- What?
- well
- Yeah, OK; I saw her again
- Simone, the radio host
- Yes, Simone
She apologized; she realized that she had under-estimated me
- Yeah, I didn't doubt it for a second
- well I don't blame her Even I under-estimate myself
- Less and less I'd say
What's worse is that you slept with her
- How do you know that Louis?
- How do you know that sir?
- How do you know that?
And so what?
- Come on, take a good look at yourself
Biron, she's leading you on
- You should have seen who was leading who
- Yeah, right
Come on "leader"
- Where are we going?
- Pierre
- Sedative With a dose like that, he could sleep for two days
What did that woman say on the phone?
- Sophie?
- Yeah - She said that Pierre wanted us to know that blanche's book isn't blanche's book And that blanche didn't write the thirteenth chapter
- Why does he want to us to know that?
- We're wasting our time
- Pierre Lamy, special Agent CorbeiI
- He's taking a nap
- Pierre Lamy national Security, please follow me
Get dressed
- Jean-Guy, please don't go
Look, I won't take a punch
I only have my left but believe you me, it's gonna be a massacre
- Jean-Guy Poitras - Yeah?
- special Agent CorbeiI, please follow me
- I understand, really, I do I would hesitate too
But if you don't fight, my plan to open BeIiveau's safe is dead in the water
- The lumberjack accident hides something big
Bigger than blanche's murder
Hey, twelve guys died for that secret
We'd make the national News
Lapointe?
- Right
"Be where the thief dances"
- Look Biron
The last clue from blanche
"Be where the thief dances"
The thief; that's Poitras, who rigged his fight
And where does he dance?
Here
- Yeah, exactly
Take off your jacket
- Huh?
- You'II fight
- I didn't say it, BIanche did
- Listen, you only have today to train
And you have quite an adversary, might I add
Look, the fight has to last at Ieast ten no, no otherwise I won't have enough time
- Mr a little something for you
- Ah yes!
- Lapointe?
Lapointe?
Are you all right?
- I'm warning you Biron, this better be worth it
- It will be, it just has to last fifteen, twenty minutes and I'II be fine
Attention everyone
Don't miss the first ever Super gala
The one and only "Death Hammer" Jean-Guy Poitras
What are you doing moron?
Suzanne!
- Do you smell it?
Try this one Powder smells sweet and dry,
like a good scotch - What are we doing here?
Hunting season hasn't started and I hate wild game
- Hunting is good for the nerves
- I'II calm down when the deal's done and when Armand is
- Never mind Armand Stephanie doesn't want him anymore; he has nothing left here He'II leave on his own
- I don't understand why we should give him his share
- Because you don't rob a guy from the Iast thing he's got
You of all people should know that
- Aside from that, I have a problem with Catherine
- Be patient with her
There are a Iot of things you don't know about her
I asked her to marry me
- Huh?
- You heard me
- You asked her
And what did she answer?
- I Iove her and don't take me wrong but I Iove her more than I ever loved your mother
That journalist is cozying up to her
He'II get out of the way, trust me
- Is that why we're here, so you could tell me this?
- What? Afather and his son can't hunt together without
I just want you to know that sometimes, you have to feel like you're losing things to really appreciate them
Give me your shades
The sun's in my face
- Here Dad
Are you all right Dad?
- Yes, yes, I'm all right
- I got it
- You got it Dad Let's go get it
- Thanks for the flowers, last night
And the note
- You weren't home
- I was there
- I'm going a little too fast, is that it?
- Georges, my sister's husband, thinks that once you know me better, you'II dump me
- Isn't he a little biased?
- still, he's probably right
- Do you really think this is a sex game?
honestly Catherine;
I'm not twenty years old anymore
although I might appear to be
- There's no age for chasing skirts
But that's not the point
- Oh, by the way I'd rather you wouldn't be at the gala, tonight
I'm about to do something that I wouldn't want you to see
- And I'm about to show you something I never thought I couId show
- Catherine, what's wrong?
I don't know what you want to show me but Can it wait?
- I won't have the courage twice
- Go away, go away
- Catherine calm down
- please, please
- OK, I'II leave
Fights, special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
Attention, everyone
- I'm fed up, man
We should have recorded it
- Now you think of that! Damn idiot!
- Why don't you shut up?
- When will you learn to mind your own business?
- What is HeIène doing in the interrogation room, have you seen what state she's in?
- She appeared on TV, Iike the other three, we're looking for a connection
- In the mean time, what do we do about Marcoux?
It's been three days since he disappeared
- I won't send out a search party every time a cheated husband slams the door
- But Dad, it's Marcoux
- I'II tell you one last time Gastonne;
you take things too personal
If you want to become any good at this job
- You think I'm no-good too?
- What you need to be a cop is a cool head, common sense and a gun
You're my daughter but all you've got is the gun
Monette?
Monette it's me
Say, do you know wrestling?
What the hell is a "Death Hammer"?
- So, how are things going?
Any headway? - I've wasted my time
They have no idea why they appeared on TV and they have nothing in common
Aside from the weirdo and the nymphomaniac, they barely know each other
The boxer is a retard
The bi-gendered hairdresser is completely insane
The woman only talked about her husband who left her
And the kid wasn't saying anything
- What have you learned since you've been here?
- What is blocking the TV signal is a magnetic field
- Yes But we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmitting from
The antenna on the mountain?
- I checked
To locate the source, we would need to intercept the signal
This means climbing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmitting at that moment
- I've already called Georges Ferron to go with you
BeIiveau and I, we have to prepare a first report, and we have nothing to give them
So if you find anything new
hello?
- hello my handsome Christian
It's Dove
- hello Babe!
I was just thinking about you
- well, well
- About you
- I was calling to tell you I'II be arriving tomorrow,
I'II be alone
- Tomorrow?
Tomorrow's fine
alone?
You're brave
- I decided to trust you Christian
- You shouldn't
- I'II be a friend of yours visiting from montreal
We'II do this in broad daylight
real smooth
- You know
I really do like you
- Thanks, I forgot it
I can't be without that clip
Step right up Ladies and gentlemen!
An evening filled with excitement awaits you
Come in and see spectacular fights
We have wrestling, we have boxing We have plenty of TV's so you won't miss anything if someone else appears
Step right up!
- It's up to you
- Hey!
There's a girl here!
- She's not a girl, she's a cop
- careful, her boyfriend is a hairdresser
- You mean her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- You can't leave tonight Pierre
- I'II take a plane tomorrow:
that will be one less freak in Great Bear
- At least tell me what you saw in blanche's book
- It isn't blanche's book
- will you just explain then?
- You looked
You'II pay the price, Great Bear will pay
Go away
- tell me who blanche's heiress is
Why didn't her powers get passed on?
- You'II know nothing
- I feel that blanche's soul is trapped
help me free her
Pierre, help me help blanche
- You don't understand
- No, I don't understand
Pierre?
- Her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- Here
- Thanks
- Don't let it get to you
They're all afraid they are freaks too, on the inside
They all are a little, and they know it
It soothes them to see people who are on the outside
- When blanche was here, we could just go see her
- Hey, it's starting!
Ladies and gentlemen!
welcome to
- In the spotlight, idiot
- welcome to the Von Trieck hangar, site of the most incredible entertainment
- This better be worth it, BIanche, or you'II hear from me in the great beyond
- And now Ladies and gentlemen, the first fight of the evening will oppose: In the blue corner,
"Bobby the Mayor" BeIiveau
And in the red corner, "Luigi Big Star" Lapointe
That wasn't in the script
- Hey, I just had a concussion here
- people are supposed to root for me
- Be careful
Put everything exactly back where you got it
If he notices anything, we're done for
- will we have time?
- Yes, Maryse is alone here until six o'cIock
- You think Pierre will be able to?
- He read the book, he had visions
If anyone is capable of saving blanche's soul, he is
We must do it before he leaves
- How many fingers?
- Everyone remembers the words?
- Hey, can you see my finger?
- He's knocked out
- Move away
- No, no, no!
- Where are we at?
- "Death Hammer"
- Mrs
Why didn't you tell me?
- Pierre, help me!
help me!
- blanche?
You were right
"Where the thief dances"
- I didn't know what the sentence meant when I wrote it
- But you were right
- If you want But now I'm here to tell you I was wrong
- tell me everything
Who killed you, who killed Dr the TV, the book
- You're the one who must answer those questions
AII I can tell you now is this:
I've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes her discoveries
I have also told you that most of us want to do good, not evil
unfortunately, every thirteenth generation, there is an evil witch
She writes the thirteenth chapter, a bloody chapter, full of maIedictions
- Mom! Stop!
Stop, she can't take it anymore!
- For thirty years, I wrote the twelfth chapter of my book
I couldn't accept that when I died I would have to give my powers to an evil one
So I decided to change the course of things and to skip the thirteenth chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
I chose my son's wife
She accepted to submit herself to a Iong and hard treatment
She fought alone against a thousand demons
I pushed her to the end, in the hopes to save a generation against forces of evil
- Leave Diane alone, is that clear?
- I failed
Thomas lost his wife
Sarah lost her mother
The whole town lost a friend
One last thing
The last victim will serve as a compass
- The last victim will serve as a compass
Thanks Pierre
Now listen
- apparently there are a Iot of bears in the area
- Yeah
A Iot
- November 5th, vote BeIiveau
- And now, the moment you have been waiting for;
the fight opposing, in the red corner, the former Canadian champion, medium weight:
Jean-Guy Poitras
And in the blue corner
You! - Dad!
Dad you can't let that happen
He doesn't have a permit for this
- Come on, can you see me trying to take away their show?
They already hold me responsible for the TV
- Dad, you can't, you can't!
- Leave me alone
- OK, you're right
Good night - calling me a fag, huh?
Very brave when you're twelve against one with baseball bats, but face to face
Come on you cowards, I have one hand tied behind my back
Come on, big guy, Iet's go!
- You put everything back exactly in its place?
- Yes perfectly
- We have a volunteer ladies and gentlemen:
Rick Cyr
- AII right!
Hey
- Thanks Biron
CorbeiI, we have a problem
- What do we do now?
- We wait
Hoping that the madman who transmits on Great Bear's waves sends another episode
- The madman might be just a joker
- Trust me
To do what he does, one must be deranged
- And you designed the device?
You experimented on humans?
- I was doing research on mental imagery
CorbeiI's the one who pushed me
- She stroked my ego
I was going to make history
national Security offered me a laboratory, volunteer test subjects
I fell for it
- Quit whining
Do you know what's going on?
- Someone pushed my research further
I was able to read the nerve influx of the rats to project images
But I was never able to search their memories
I never had the intention to broadcast
- So The rabbits on TV
- They must have been test subjects
- But what we've been seeing on TV That doesn't come from the mind of a rabbit
What we've been seeing on TV, logically, must have come from The mind of blanche Von Trieck
Except that she's dead
- I don't know exactly how but just before her death, the madman was able make an electronic copy of her brain
It's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- That guy isn't a madman, he's a genius
- Yeah, a genius! Who has already killed at Ieast two people:
Von Trieck and Dr
- How many have you killed?
- I never killed anybody, I stopped
They wanted me to continue but I refused
- But still, you must have an idea of who might be doing this?
- It has to be someone who knows my research
Those guys are scattered all over the world
Except LefIaguais who's dead
- LefIaguais?
- A signal
We'II locate the transmitter
- LefIaguais?
No! No!
- So
You got to Grande Ourse two days ago
- You're sending me to a hole
- Out of the blue, you ended up at blanche Von Trieck's
- I was waiting for you
- Then you took a night stroll with the old woman
- I don't know the meaning of these sentences but I know they will help you, one by one, to save my soul
- And mine
It's been a Iong time since I've seen such a beautiful women
I thought the clues were leading me to a criminal
- The last victim will act as a compass
- In reality, they were leading me to you
- Lapointe?
BIanche's killer it's Catherine
Lapointe?
Lapointe! It's Catherine!
It's Catherine, Lapointe
Catherine Open the door!
I know you're there
- Georges
- No Catherine!
- Catherine!
- Get in I have to talk to you
I know
- No, I know
- Stephanie
Stef
- Soon it won't hurt anymore, you'II see
- Yes, I need an ambulance at the La Forge hotel, room number two
It looks like a heart attack, hurry up
They're on their way Georges
- Catherine is not a woman for you
You don't know her
You don't know anything about her
- Forget about that OK?
Don't think about that
- Listen
She's the one I Ioved
She was 15, I was 24
I was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off Suzanne first, her older sister
It was Catherine's idea,
I swear
Catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
But don't think she didn't love her sister
She adored her
It was for her she did all this
Suzanne was deranged, almost always off in her own world
She would have ended up alone, unhappy
Catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
It went wrong when Catherine got pregnant
She cried for weeks, but to protect her sister, she decided to have an abortion
In those days, Thomas Von Trieck's wife was blanche's apprentice Except that she was using what the learned from blanche to do black magic
Catherine went to see her
But the abortion didn't work
She went off to montreal to have the baby
He was born a vegetable and a gimp
She never forgave herself
She hid him
And she became obsessed She dedicated her life to finding a way to cure our son
She never succeeded
She's only been back in Great Bear for two, three years
I thought things were better
- Georges Where can I find her?
- You won't find her
- LefIaguais's bimbo is here
- Yes, that's it
It looks like Catherine, Ferron's sister-in-Iaw
- And his mistress
- Yes, exactly
- Ferron I knew he did it on purpose
- Paquette, couldn't you have thought of that?
- LefIaguais's girlfriend? She couldn't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amoeba
At least she didn't look like it
- BeIiveau?
- Yes?
- Not you, your daughter
Very good work, BeIiveau
I will personally see that your efforts be rewarded by a promotion
- Thanks
- This is a very serious case
You saw what happened in Great Bear, on a small scale?
If the discoveries of what's her name?
- Catherine LapIante
- If LapIante's discoveries were found out, if they ended up in the wrong hands
Do you understand? - Yes
- We have to act quickly so that despite a few errors committed in the past, the information concerning this case remains secret
- That I can't
- Sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the lesser of two evils
In this case, it's better to leave the deaths of a few Iumberjacks unpunished than to risk that dangerous technologies end up in the hands of terrorists, or
- Got it!
I found the coordinates of the transmitter that broadcasted those images last night
- Forget what you know about the Iumberjacks
It won't bring them back;
it's all in the past We need you, right now
- You won't regret it, Captain BeIiveau
- Chief, someone stole a body from the morgue
- Who's body?
- blanche
A bunch of people took her
They're freaking out because of the TV They want to bury her
- Come on!
- BeIiveau, I want my lawyer!
I want my lawyer!
I want my lawyer
- Buy us some time
Let him see Armand but no one else
- Catherine?
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for Stephanie
She got in the car with Catherine and I can't find her
What's this?
- Catherine It can't be true
- What? - Biron is in danger, your Stephanie too
- What do you mean, in danger?
- Come on, I'II explain on the way
- He's my stepbrother?
- genetically, achilles is even closer to you since I'm your mother's sister
But there isn't a name for that, except "bastard"
- When I found out you're the one who killed mom, I wanted to kill you Catherine, I swear
But now
- Revenge doesn't make the pain go away
only forgiveness can
But people are too weak to forgive
You'II feel so much better after
- So, now it's party time
- I'II sleep here tonight
Take me out for dinner and
- Right
- The images that appeared last night were broadcasted from here
- That's close to the old mine
- I'II take a GPS, I'II manage
But make sure your daughter stays on our side until Biron has his accident
After that she won't be able to do anything
This might be a very important day, boys!
- What do you think she'II do once she can search anybody's brain?
- She'II spread joy all around the world
- Chief!
Chief!
- What? What is it?
- It's Biron
He hung himself in his cell
Oh no!
help!
Somebody! Hurry!
Open the door! unlock the door!
Oh my God!
OK, I got him Go call an ambulance, quick!
- hold on, hold on
- I'm proud of you son
You handled it like a pro
I can go in peace now
- C'mon Dad
- Christian, all I have is yours now
But take care of your sister
- Don't say that Dad, our business has just started
We'II get more wads like these, you'II see
- What's wrong?
- Nothing
- No, I know there's something, what is it Dad?
- It's OK son, it's experience
- What?
- Counterfeit
- That two-timing little tramp!
- calm down Christian
- well, thanks guys
- I've had this harness since I played the hanging of Louis-RieI in a college play And now; an escape
- well, it wasn't AIcatraz, but still
- So now we have to go to the morgue, we have to find Stephanie
- The morgue?
- Yes, because the real "last victim" was Dr Mondoux
There's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to Stef - So, he knows everything now?
- You're the one who wanted to split
- Yeah but still Not two days ago he was "that little brat" and now - Get out
- No problem
- The only reason I got you out of there was because I thought your life was in danger because of what you read on the Iumberjacks - I didn't read anything
- Hey!
Don't give me that shit
When they got a hold of you, you were fleeing to montreal with the scoop
- Yeah
- Don't worry Biron, at your age, in those circumstances,
I would have done the same
- really?
- But what hurts me is that you didn't tell me face to face
- I I know
- Yeah
- Now, don't tell me you didn't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or I I'II never speak to you again
I really wouldn't have taught you anything
- well
I took some digital pictures
I have them all right here, on mini-disc
- That's my Biron!
OK, now you can go
- Go where?
- To montreal
- No, I can't go alone; you have to come with me
- No, your time has come
You wanted your chance: you got it
- No, no, I couldn't
- Listen,
I came here to save my soul, not my career
Remember?
- Yeah, right
- Look, Saint-Denis will pick you up in half an hour at the Crooked Lake, OK?
One last thing
Listen, a Iong story but
Catherine killed blanche and the doctor
- What?
No
Didn't I tell you not to trust her?
You really liked her didn't you?
I'm really sorry
- Take care of yourself
- Yeah, thanks for everything
- What do you mean, the morgue is closed? - They've already stolen a body
- Who's?
- blanche's
They're gone to bury or cremate her
They're the only ones left
- It's Dr Mondoux we want to see
- impossible
- The last victim Wait!
Look These are the marks from Paquette and Catherine's device He's the Iast victim
But what does it mean, "The last victim will act as a compass"?
- Armand, if I've learned one thing here it's that sometimes
"The last victim will act as a compass" simply means the Iast victim will act as a compass
- Are you sure?
- Do you have another way to find Catherine and Stephanie?
- I'm telling you, they took the body into the woods
What do we tell her family? What?
What?
I don't understand;
let me talk to him
Hi, Dad? Yes
What do you mean escaped? - Escaped!
He's gone
I have all the roads under surveillance, the hydroplanes too
He won't go far but he can talk
- He wants his scoop He won't talk
Except that there's more than one lake in the area
- I don't have enough staff to check all the lakes
- Saint-Denis
- What about Saint-Denis?
- He's coming down
He's going to Crooked Lake
- Crooked Lake
Easy, easy
Easy
- Don't move Biron!
Stay here!
- You'II take me in
You'II send me to my death? - I have orders You can't leave Great Bear
- Orders from who?
Your father?
CorbeiI? They're in it up to here, Gastonne
- This is a national Security matter
- No, no, this is an anal Security matter
Those two want to save their asses and you know it
- You're only thinking of your scoop, you're not seeing the consequences
- Yes, I'm thinking of my scoop
And the consequences will be the truth will come out and justice will be done
- Don't make me laugh! There always will be injustice Biron
Don't you see?
It won't do any good to play Don Quichotte
Stay here - There's a windmill awaiting me
I know you don't believe what you say
You'd Iike to save your father but it's too late
He did what he did
You'II have to live with the choices you're making today as well
- Come back
- Think about it Gastonne
We never will be
But I've known you for twenty-five years
If there's one thing I know, it's that we'II never be on the side of the liars and cheaters
You might doubt that today
I still doubted it yesterday
But I Iook at myself today, I Iook at you And I'm sure of it
- Biron, don't do this
Biron, come back!
Biron, I Iove you!
I Iove you!
I'm sorry Dad
- You shouldn't be
- My friends
Before blanche can join the spirits of the forest, I have to tell you something
- Catherine
please!
I forgive you
I don't want to lose my memories
- Poor little girl, you're scared
But you'II feel so much better after
I'II only remove the bad ones
You know, at first, I did all this for achilles
With neurology, I was trying to find a way to talk to him To tell him that if I couId start over
But I can't
So I wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
I didn't want blanche to die I thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did, we would be forced to forgive one another
Don't you think?
- Stef?
- Catherine, no
Catherine, please
It's over now, Iet me help you
- I can go in peace now
AII I have is yours
- Don't do anything stupid Christian,
look at it as a game
You lost this one, you'II win others
- No, no
I can lose them all but not this one
- You've already all read blanche's book
- Yes
- blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation, the thirteenth chapter, the evil one, so she could pass on her powers to someone good
But she failed
That's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exists
It will always exist
We have to keep fighting it, all the time, whether it's inside or outside of ourselves
- OK, but
Who would be the thirteenth?
The bad one?
- Yeah, who's the heiress of blanche's powers?
- For me, there's no doubt
She's the thirteenth
Sarah Von Trieck
- Don't you think you've done enough, Pierre?
First, you disrespect my mother's body, and now, her granddaughter
This little girl is grieving so much since her grandmother died that she hasn't said a word
And you want to make her out to be a demon?
- She's the one I tell you
I'm sure, she's the one
Didn't you hear that?
She said she wants to kill me!
Didn't you hear?
- That's enough Pierre Go have yourself examined
Leave us alone
- You don't believe me, you'II regret it
You'II all regret it
- You want to burn her right here?
- Yes
- Let's finish this
- It's over now
Let me help you
- Go
You
Stay here
- You were hiding a Iot of things from me
- I never hid that I hid things
- True
- That I was a monster?
- No, that's not it
- Admit it, I am a monster in your eyes now, Iike in my own
- No, no, no Catherine, no
- The look in your eyes was the only hope I had left
- The look in your eyes was what saved me
Thanks to you Catherine, I've changed
- Sit down
please
- Are you all right?
- Do you still love me, in spite of everything?
- Yes, in spite of everything, in spite of my own will sometimes
Come on, we've got to get help
- would you forgive me?
- I can tell you're going to break my heart
That, I'm warning you, I won't forgive you for
- It's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- Is this a challenge or a warning?
- A bit of both
I thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did, we would be forced to forgive one another
- Catherine, it's useless now
- Right
It's useless
- samuel?
- Marcoux?
BIanche?
- I want to see him again
- Very interesting, so to conclude
- Those inhumane treatments were forced upon twelve innocent people for highly immoral research
- So, there are still missing chapters to this story
You will be reporting those soon
- Oh yes, absolutely, Marc
I can already tell you that the topic of this secret research should surprise everyone
- Very interesting Mr
Tune in next week Marc Bonsecours saying see you soon
- Where are you?
- I'm in front of blanche's house - You're asking yourself if you have saved your soul?
- If I've saved my soul?
well, if it means that I'm able to look forward despite what's behind
Yes
I think so
- Are you going to drop the bottle?
- well, it's actually very quiet in Great Bear, isn't it?
- It is except when you're there
- Bye Lapointe
- Are you there?
Yeah, sorry it was Lapointe
I couldn't - I'm in my bath too now
- Oh yeah?
Sorry, it's funny because It's the first time that
I imagine you
- And?
- well
- To begin I will tell you how I killed my mother
- Hey Luc
You're up late again tonight?
In the Iast episode
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- If I catch the guy who did this
- We'II catch him Marcoux We'II catch him and he's going to pay
- The body seems to have been partially buried then dragged on the ground
- You went strolling outside with the old woman, in the middle of the night, without any apparent reason
AII of a sudden, a kind of shadow attacked you You fainted and you never saw her alive again
- Mr Mayor: you deserve nine out of ten
- Sir? You lost this
You'II be needing it
- Man, that's Poitras' face
- I Iove GiIbert
That's why I'II go down after the sixth round against taylor
- Ah fuck! - I'm not a fag, OK?
- Boys!
- I'II call the others
I'm not a fag
Somebody fired a shot
My God, Sophie, I'm sorry
Is there anything I can do?
Not one word on what happened, OK?
I heard a shot, I came right away but there was no one here
He shot himself before someone else did
Don't say that, the guys aren't crazy
They wouldn't have killed him for a couple grants
You think?
Not for that either:
look
"I'm not a fag"
Can you believe it?
What were you all doing here?
well
We all gather here to talk about blanche
I've invited you before
BIanche is dead
So?
We can still talk about her
You believe she transmitted her powers, Iike she said?
Don't you?
I believe in what I see
And these days, the picture isn't very nice
BIanche also believed in what she saw except she saw a Iot more and a Iot further than we do
I know you've secretly been to see her too
I beg your pardon?
Once or twice
Out of curiosity, Iike everyone else
When the bear growls, it will be exactly 9AM
You're tuned in to Great Bear Radio, with Simone Letendre
So, Mr Mayor?
Everything is under control
still, there have been three suspicious deaths within a week
I can't keep people from shooting themselves
I mean
I'm deeply sorry for the families It's tragic
As for Mrs Von Trieck, I'm grieving like everyone else
The investigation is under way but let's not put the horses before the cart
- Ha! The horses
- still, she's the most liked and respected woman in town
Any leads? Suspects? Anything at all?
- horses in front of the cart
- The priority is the safety of the population
We obviously have several leads, I can't give any details
- Come on! Come on!
Give them details!
- people seem to think that you don't know the details
What people?
- Everybody
- And what about the TV, do you know anything about that?
people would Iike to know when it will come back
I made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
In my days, there was no television
- In other words, you have no clue what's going on
well thank you Mr Mayor for the enlightenment - That's right!
Thank you very much You have no idea what's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- Poor blanche
- She's quite determined, your ex
I'm starting to understand her
Too bad I'm leaving; I couId have told you what to do with her
Never mind Simone
You can't leave;
you're a witness in a murder investigation
Might as well make the most of it and do a story
Biron, I'm tired, I need some rest
- Do you think we ever got any rest?
We worked twelve hours a day and at night
Nothing ever happens in Great Bear
Then, you come here, there's a murder, a manhunt, suicides, TV freaks out
Biron I have nothing to do with your farfetched tales
- I won't fetch anything very far, at my age
When I found you last night, there was this paper at your feet
Are you writing poetry? - Poetry is boring
But at Christmas time, sometimes we'd sing songs
- Yeah, that's it I write poetry
Don't forget what blanche said;
your fate is linked to hers
My fate I'm not dead
What is a dead person's fate?
- Poor blanche
- follow me, I'II show you
- We'd sing What was it that we'd sing?
"The paddle leads us round and round"
The paddle leads us round and round
She got me the old bat!
She got me
And the elections are coming up
Fanatics;
it could cost me my mayor's job
BIanche was all that's good in the world, all put together in the same person, who would listen to them and guide them
She told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - No way!
- How would you know?
Lapointe's deposition
Yeah, that's what he told me at the hospital, word for word
Big surprise!
Why would it have changed?
What did they teach you at police academy?
Why would he lie?
BIanche left him a paper with clues we should follow
Hey, the case is muddy enough without me worrying about the old woman's hallucinations
Forget it!
About Suzanne Ferron; I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time
Proofs were erased, purposely You don't say?
By the way the cleaners will be there tomorrow morning, before Thomas gets out of the hospital
In the mean time, don't touch anything and keep your nose out of it
Look Sarah; Daddy's in top shape
Oh yes!
Now I've got it!
I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner!
Another stroke of genius?
Hey, hey!
Don't mock me little Miss Ferron
I'm thinking of changing my last name
I'II take my mother's
There's an idea!
Your father's gonna have a cow!
I'd say it looks like you hate him as much as I do
I'm sorry about blanche
Yeah
I'm sorry about your mother too
She still hasn't said a word eh?
Poor child
Hey guys!
We're closing up
I've got an idea
Fantastic?
Extraordinary?
Insane?
AII of the above!
Do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us? Because of what we did with blanche's book?
Of course not
gilbert Thibodeau never needed any help to get into trouble
I don't feel so good since blanche is gone
Everything is backwards and
I'm scared
You're too sensitive Honey
BIanche wouldn't have liked us playing with forces we can't control
Sophie was putting us on
You really think she left her body and saw blanche with wires coming out of her head?
She rose above the table, you saw her
well, Iet's keep that between us for now, OK? Yeah
Wait for me; I'II give you a lift
I've never felt that way in all my Iife, Pierre
I felt myself leave
I don't know where but I was floating
Come here
I think I-I-I'm gonna go now
Pierre, Pierre, come lay down, you're tired
No, no
I felt powerful and free
Excuse me
What's the matter?
Hey!
If you're gay too, then I'm the one who's gonna shoot myself
No, that's not it
I just can't! You're played the tease long enough
At first, it turned me on but It's not funny anymore, Pierre
It wasn't my intention Sophie, I'm sorry
If it's because of gilbert, you know there was nothing left between us I have to go
Pierre, I need a man!
I need you
Hurry up Biron; I'm having a shitty day
You better have a good reason to bring me back here
But you'II find the "cream of the crop" of Great Bear here You should enjoy that
I have nothing against cream;
it's sour milk I can't stand
AII right, OK I see everybody's in a good mood this morning
would you put that on, please Gastonne?
I thought all the TVs in town had nothing but snow?
Yeah but this is just a monitor
There's no antenna, nothing to receive the waves, it takes it's signal from the VCR
Biron, I know what a monitor is
OK, now, look at this
Indeed
Look at that
- He can't leave his wife like this - My VCR was programmed to record when it happened
- So I'II go down during the sixth round against taylor That's fine and dandy but
Wait wait wait
- Just for him
Watch this
What?
There
well
I'II be damned It's that bear
The old woman's stuffed bear
That's right
BIanche's didn't tape her meetings with people
No, but there's something there
There's got to be a link between blanche's murder and Poitras and the TV
And the rabbits that appeared during Poitras' fight
- well, why not?
It would be logical I don't know if it's logical but it reminds me that something's not right with your deposition
BIanche's big book you were talking about;
the night she was killed, you saw it, you're sure?
Yes, the book
Very nice, with a leather binding
We searched everywhere;
well, the killer took off with it then?
I've got an idea Come on Biron
Hey! Woah!
What idea?
I don't work for the police But you're still a suspect
It's to your advantage to cooperate
You'II get the autopsy report on the old woman?
Give us a copy and we'II tell you what we have found on our end
OK, OK
But not a word to my father eh?
I'm not supposed to get involved in that
No, no, no
We have a story now, don't we?
What's your idea? To get the autopsy report
That's a good one
But what do we do for Gastonne;
we've got nothing for her You see Biron; we have to reconstitute the events of that night, right?
We have to speak with blanche's son; he was in the house too
The autopsy report should help us reconstruct the facts and put the pieces together
Ah, cool But what do we do for Gastonne?
I have to take a shower, Biron
Come on, Iet's go
A gala?
A gala?
A gala
Sarah, hand me your drawings
Music!
Comedy!
Fights!
Magic!
cocktails! A memorable evening of entertainment!
people are looking for distractions, it's gonna fly big!
So we test the show here, then we take it on the road
Woah, and Sarah; you did all this to illustrate the evening?
Super, Boss!
Where do we start? Listen, we need big names
Poitras, our champion, is in town
- But Poitras he's, shall we say out of commission
- And grieving
- gilbert - Grieving?
So?
I'm grieving too
Life goes on guys
Life is bigger than everything, guys
Live doesn't stop here eh?
Against the odds!
He must have really loved his GiIbert
To be this sad with thirty milligrams of morphine in your blood
Never seen anything like it
What's up with you?
Did you call me here to talk about my wardrobe?
No I want to know how Mom died
You know it, Dad knows it and I don't know why you're protecting him
If he's threatening you, you'd better tell me
I'II help you That time is over Stef
I don't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
If someone falls down, you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
And when they're too much of a burden
You take off
Look at me Look at Mom
You're such an asshole
Oh yeah! That's another thing;
I'm done being nice
As of now, I'm an asshole
Now, if you'II excuse me, I have a meeting to get to
- Excuse me Stephanie;
I'm looking for Dr Mondoux
It's for an autopsy report
My mother's?
No blanche's
Because your mother Yes, she was incinerated the same night
I know Everybody knows
Yeah
Anyway
Don't bother Gastonne, it's useless now
According to Mondoux, she was partially buried, and then dragged for a good distance after her death
Why would a killer bring his victim back in her own house?
I don't know
Yeah
These marks are identical to the ones you'd find on the skin of people on whom they tested a device invented by a certain Doctor Edouard Paquette
Edouard who?
Paquette
Edouard Paquette
Mondoux has tried to contact him but he couldn't get a hold of him
- No, no tell Mondoux tell him, I'II take care of it
Everything's under control
I can help you, trust me What did I tell you?
There's no "Dad" on the job OK?
Why don't you go out for a while?
I have to think now
Josee, call agent CorbeiI from national Security, it's urgent
Good; I taped my stand up
Quite a number that one!
Soft, vulnerable one minute, cold and cruel the next
I wish I'd figured her out that quickly
She gets to you doesn't she?
Yeah, but I'm done groveIing Good for you
I know the type
They use men either as a doormat or as a pedestal
The important thing is that they can walk all over them
In fact, these girls are born unhappy and stay that way
You seem to know what you're talking about I've known a Iot of women Biron
Before finding the right one
You, Biron
You wouldn't do that would you? Use someone to get ahead?
Uh no, no
I mean, love has to be an exchange Otherwise it's unhealthy
well, Miss Catherine
You know, I've done a Iot of thinking, in fact,
I haven't slept all night And
I've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you'II accept a date
You bargain your indulgences
Ah but it was my friend Biron who said that love has to be an exchange
I accept but find something original
That's another type one should stay away from
That's more the type you'II never get close to, Biron
I'm not interested anyway
Where are we going?
I didn't see anything the night of the murder
I was at home watching TV and I had a seizure
Now, I don't want to hear about my mother's scary tales anymore
Biron, you should know that
Yes but, it's important, it might be linked to her death
I always said it was going to kill her
I don't want to hear about her or her books anymore, OK?
Don't you see I'm trying to forget? Ah yes, that's right, she told me she had two big books
You know, with leather bindings
They seemed very important to her
Right, two books
According to the stupid legend, my mother's powers were passed on from one woman to another and they would each write their chapter full of nonsense in there There would be thirteen chapters per book
well now, the the books have disappeared
Just as well
Honey, we're in a bit of a hurry right now
What's the matter?
Kitten? Do you have a fever?
You're burning up
You're all red Kitten
In two years, it's the first time that it's so
I don't know
No, no I wasn't saying
I mean I don't want to sound corny but
When I wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
I'II always remember the first day I set foot in here and blanche introduced us
She knew right away that it wouId work between us, huh?
We'II miss her eh? Oui
Sorry
It's the emotions
That little brat!
Where the hell is Gastonne?
About time
Here's the autopsy report
What have you found?
We spoke to Thomas Von Trieck at the hospital
would you have a pocket-knife or something?
No, why?
BIanche didn't have one big book; she had two
Yeah, so? well, I don't know
Do you have a screwdriver?
We'd have to read them to know
We'd have to find them first
And the piece of paper that blanche gave to Lapointe in the woods, did you find it?
Oh, that
hello
I Iove you
You're the only one
I hope so!
Christian doesn't want to see me anymore
I don't understand; he hates me
He doesn't really hate you
AII my Iife, all I've been trying to do is save the world And I can't do it
That's not true
You saved me
When you found me,
I was all messed up with a biker gang after me
Without you, I was lost
still today
You're sweet, but I'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
From now on, it an eye for an eye
What will revenge get you?
Look at Lapointe who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
What was that?
Hey!
Moron!
You want me to to book you in?
Thank you
We don't have much for you but after our visit to the Von Trieck's, we should be able to help you Biron!
Don't go in there
It's a secured area
Sam
Sam
Come on, it's late
- Hey! hello Gorgeous!
Hi!
Hey, guys! Look how nice she is to her little brother
Eh Sam?
She's so nice to you
It's not lack of respect; I worry about you
It was an accident
It'II pass, we must look ahead
I don't believe in accidents
And not only for Suzanne
When something happens, when someone is born
Stop, Catherine Stop
Stop torturing yourself
If only you wanted to
That child is my son too Stop!
If only you had wanted
I Ioved you so much Georges
And for so long It's not possible anymore
Catherine
You and me; we can't let it end
It lasted this long, despite everything
Take the time to think about it
You should get some rest
Yes, you're right
I have to get some rest
I have to get some rest but
Stay right where you are!
From now on, I'm your partner What?
I take a third of the profits on everything that's illegal
I don't give a damn about
But I have plans for the bar
There'II be shows in here We have to hurry
There's no TV, people need entertainment
But for starters, you'II tell me all about the deal you were making when I walked in with Mom
I want my share
You have about ten seconds to decide
You want to go to jail?
Fine, I'II go too but you're not going to blackmail me
Christian, we can talk about it but
hello, Gastonne?
Christian Ferron Hi
Uh What's up?
Christian?
Christian?
hello Marcoux?
BeIiveau
No, not Robert, Gastonne, Smart-ass!
You're not on duty tonight
I have a question for you
What's that?
honestly
Do you think I'm a good cop? Eh well
That's what I thought
Sophie, where's your daughter now?
At her grandmother's
I think blanche's soul is still close to us
Yes, when I saw her, she was tied up, she seemed imprisoned
Imprisoned by what?
By what, I don't know
But when GiIbert
I mean, there was a bang and I fell back down
Sophie, Sophie, we'II just go now
Yeah Aunt Sophie, or we'II stay and you can go get some rest
No, no, no We can't leave blanche in that state
What can we do?
We have to decode blanche's book
I'm sure the answer is in there
Her book BIanche never allowed us to touch it
Yet, she gave it to Pierre
Why him?
Good question
well, there's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
BIanche gave you that paper You threw it out
Then a little boy brought it back to you
And when you were on the verge of giving up, the crazy old man at the restaurant started singing: "The paddle leads us round and round "
Biron, that was the purpose of the first sentence
Keep me from giving up and keep me here, in Great Bear Yes!
That's just like blanche
OK Read the second sentence
"He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again"
"He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again"
Isn't there a story about some golden mane?
The mane the mane
According to Gastonne's report, they found nothing in the bear's fur, nothing in blanche's hair
It's not really a mane but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
That's odd, isn't it?
Yeah but with all people that come to see her, it's kind of normal
But Biron, there certainly wasn't twelve people that went under the chair in one day
He who gathers the mane the mane
There must be a hair salon in Great Bear?
- Who works there?
It's it's
He does
You're trying my patience son
Come on, get the strap!
You never hesitated before!
Georges, Iet him go
- Mr Ferron?
- What do you want Mike?
Turn on your TV, quick!
I'II let you think about it until tomorrow
It's not that you're not a good cop It's it's just not natural for you Your mind is too nuanced, know what I mean?
So, to be a good cop, you have to be narrow minded?
No, seriously, Gastonne; what made you become a cop?
Why?
You mean, "who made me?"
You followed someone to the academy?
I ran away from someone who hurt me
You, the first day you arrived in Great Bear, you found the woman of your dreams
Two years already
I spend my Iife in Great Bear and
- Attention all units There's someone else on TV
It's
Keep an eye out in case things heat up
Who is it?
Marcoux! Find that person and make sure they're safe
So far, it has meant bad luck to
Pierre Lamy, it's Pierre Lamy
It's Pierre Lamy
Her?
She doesn't know
I couldn't tell her Because she loves me and I don't want her to stop
Gastonne loves me because she thinks I'm a man
No
To have both sexes isn't being a man
I have one ovary and one testicle
I'm not a man
If you could see it
If Gastonne saw it
Yes
I'd rather hurt her
I'd rather she went away
I'd rather
Anything but that
Hey! Imagine that!
You can with yourself
Yeah
How do you do it?
That's it!
That's him!
Him what?
That's why blanche gave him the book
Pierre is the heiress to her powers
Oh my God!
hello?
Doctor, are you in your office?
well, yes, obviously
Doctor
Doctor, tell me you're alone?
alone?
Of course I'm
Doctor?
Doctor!
In the Iast episode - Avery bad cycle has begun
- hold me tight Armand
- They can't stand themselves without TV
Look at them!
They're all watching out for the next scandal
- Look at them closely; they're shaking They're all shitting their pants for fear of being the next one
- Gastonne loves me because she thinks I'm a man
- What about the TV, do you know anything about that?
- I made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
- Paquette is the only one who can help us to understand what's going on
- He reads the rats' thoughts?
- Better than that, he turns them into images
- If he knew I slept with practically everything in a uniform in Great Bear
- well thank you Mr Mayor You have no idea what's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- She's quite determined, your ex
- You seem to know what you're talking about
- I have known a Iot of women Biron, before finding my own
- See you again soon, Mr Lapointe
- So, the next one would be: "Got cells"
- Yeah, well, they've been in order since the beginning
- Got cells, got cells, got cells, got cells, got cells
- Come on, come on!
- My glove
That's Armand
Stop it Sweetheart
Mommy's doing this for your own good
What's wrong?
Oh no
Biron, samuel said: "Got cells"
Georges, have you seen it?
What should we do?
- I don't know
He hasn't said anything yet;
maybe he won't say anything at all
About us anyway
- I doubt that I'II call you back, OK?
- OK
Mommy will be back
Madame Von Trieck;
promise me that you will never tell Stephanie
- Armand, what hurts people the most isn't what we tell them but what we don't
- No
If I told Stephanie I'm still mixed up with my old gang and that I do worse things than before, she wouldn't understand that I'm doing it for her
- I know
- No, you don't
- Yes
Her name is Dove
She's beautiful and wild and she's after you because you betrayed her
That's why you're hiding in Great Bear
- But how
- You told Stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- It's true I didn't want anything to do with the business anymore and Dove had put a hit on my head
- Yes, beautiful Dove is mad at you, but it's not a business matter:
it's her heart you betrayed
like you're betraying Stephanie by not telling her
- No I Iove her
- Yes, and you will tell her
- No!
Never!
- Oh yes, I can see it
She will learn everything from your own mouth
Never trust anyone, Sarah
No one
Ah!
Lapointe
Biron, she kissed me, right here!
- Good for you In the mean time, HeIène Marcoux's brother said the fourth sentence
And Armand LafIamme appeared on TV
This is where you were coming from the other day
- You must be very careful; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bicycle
- Hey, don't give me orders, Buddy
- Hey, calm down!
I wouldn't have expected that from you
I only told them who to call to find the material and the ingredients
From there, it's just a recipe
hello?
Yes, Armand is here What?
OK, fine we'II wait here
- What's wrong?
- Nothing we wait here
- What's going on?
- I told you, nothing
Hey, what do you do with that?
- You are the worst liar I've ever heard
- Don't you get it?
The days when you pretended to be a good boy and fucked my sister are over I'm the boss now
You're acting just like your father and you always said he was a dumb-ass
- You never stop, do you?
My father said to wait here
I don't know what's going on but if something's happened to Stephanie
You believe Pierre's story now?
- Biron, I said, "let's suppose"
Listen to this
The night she died,
BIanche leaves with me for the woods, OK?
meanwhile, Pierre goes into the house to look in the book
In the woods, someone knocks me out, kills the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught, probably by Sarah and her friends, who, according to Pierre, brought the body home
So, chances are Sarah saw the killer
- well, probably probably according to Pierre there's a chance
Come on, that story will never fly
- No, no, Biron
It would explain the footprints in the kitchen, the haIf-done burial and the return of the body to the house
- Let's suppose, Iike you say
But it's probably after ten o'cIock right now
little Sarah, who doesn't speak, is probably asleep
And according to me, chances are Stephanie won't welcome you with much hospitality
- Ah! Biron, you're absolutely right
- Right
- So
Oh no!
That girl intimidates me
- Biron, all girls intimidate you
- Hi
- Hi
This might seem strange but it's a Iong story but
I'd Iike to talk to Sarah - Sarah's in bed
Come back some other time if you want to play with her, OK?
- It's really important
I I have some questions for her
Biron, she hasn't said a word
Yes, I know but
That idiot Lapointe sent you, is that it?
Can't he mind his own business?
- No, that wasn't him
I mean I'm quite capable of myself
I just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- She saw someone take off on a four-wheeIer
That's all
- On a four-wheeIer
- The little brat is here!
Come on Biron!
Armand
Stef!
Are you OK?
I thought something had happened to you
- You were right
Just tell me you're not associated with my father
Oh no Oh no
- What is it?
- I saw him He can't be very far
- Who?
- Got him!
Come here!
That's the little boy who gave me blanche's paper
- Luc, what are you doing here this late?
- You like staying up late, don't you?
Look You gave me that paper eh?
Where did you get it?
And how did you know it was mine?
- Luc, Luc, Luc You and Sarah and the others, when's the Iast time you saw Mrs Von Trieck?
- I don't remember
- Listen Luc, huh?
It's very important that you tell us when you saw
Mrs Von Trieck for the Iast time
- The last time? - Yes
- Yes
- It's when she gave us pops the other day
Stay here
You little bastard, get over here
Get over here!
- Your son stays out late
- He's not my father
- Stay here
- What's your problem?
You fancy little boys?
Is that it?
- Come on Rick, relax
- You're right Luc: run
You're better off outside than with him
- I have to bring him back to his mother if I want to have any fun tonight
Come on, get over here Hurry up!
But we'II see each other again, you and I
What will become of this child?
- He doesn't look like the kind of kid who would be dragging corpses in the middle of the night
His problems are elsewhere
- Some days, Biron, humanity discourages me, you have no idea
Don't listen to blanche Don't listen to blanche It's dangerous
- But somebody's got to do it
- No, not you
- Somebody's got to do it
- No - Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to
Somebody's got to do it
- Diane, Diane
- Thomas, Thomas
Thomas
It'II be OK
It was just a mild one
- Yeah
You called me Diane
Thomas
I can't take it anymore
I'm worried about Sarah
She's weird
Sometimes I think she's talking to me in my head
She needs her father
Everybody keeps calling to find out when blanche's funeral will be
I don't know what to tell them
You act like nothing happened
You spend your whole days organizing boxing matches, I
I'm really sorry Stephanie
You really loved Armand, eh?
I just want him to come back
- well, Gastonne said if there's no news soon, they'II organize a search party
- Just want him back
Did SamueI say anything, since last night?
- He mumbles all the time
Sometimes you can make out words, sometimes not
- He's like that since, uh
- Since the accident
About ten years ago, a bunch of Iumberjacks left in a helicopter to work in the North
Coming back, the chopper crashed
They all died except Sam
Some hunters found him, Iike that, two weeks later
- He wasn't hurt?
- No
- Got cells got cells
cells cells
You're tuned in to Great Bear Radio with Simone Letendre
At the bear's growl, it will be exactly 9 o'cIock
Rise and shine my little bear cubs!
How are you this morning?
The awakening wasn't too hard?
No, TV still isn't back but we were treated to a new episode starring one of our citizens, last night
Poor Armand, poor Stephanie
Ah, but it's not easy finding love
Each time we open the door to our heart to let love in, we never know what else can get in at the same time, huh?
Fear, pain, malice
But maybe also tenderness, joy, happiness
Who knows?
We never know
- Happy Birthday darling!
But, Marie, I don't drink
One glass of wine and I'm drunk
- This is for the day I leave you
You won't be able to do without this
- I Iove your sense of humour
- Yeah, it's yours rubbing off
- Keep it
But I never want you to use it because I'II never leave you
- I promise
Where is my real gift?
- Come here
Marie!
OK, the paper in Doctor Mondoux's hand: did you find out what it is?
- Yeah
- And?
What were you doing at the Von Trieck's last night?
- We wanted to talk to Sarah
- What did she say?
- well Nothing
- What was the Doctor's paper?
- Give me a break OK?
We had an agreement
Since the beginning I've given you all I've had and I don't get anything back in return
- Yes I know - You're hiding things from me
You went to see Pierre too
Did he give you the idea to talk to Sarah?
What did he say to you? - Go ask him, you'II find out
He doesn't want to speak to me and everyone at the station thinks he's a freak
- You don't say?
- Hey there, bottle Neck
Quit it, all right?
Spit it out or else
- Swear that you won't use it against Pierre
- Biron, you can't sell out your sources to the police like that
- You can't treat my friends this way either
- Hey That's him
- Pierre was at blanche's house the night she died
He said he saw the kids bring her body back
- Come on The kids didn't kill blanche
- No, I don't think so either but Stephanie said Sarah saw someone take off on a four-wheeIer
- Aren't you
That famous journalist ?
- Yeah, aren't you ?
Bernard
- Yeah, yeah, Louis-Bernard Lapointe
- That's it!
That's it! - well hi
- Hi
- Hi
So what about SamueI's sentence? "Got cells"?
- Lapointe thinks it has to do with the accident ten years ago, but
- The Iumberjacks?
- Yeah, the Iumberjacks
- Don't you have, Iike a talent, a magic trick or something?
Or a malformation or a scar
- Come on
- What? Scars are cool
- No, no I won't be a clown in your freak show, all right?
- If you change your mind
- No, I won't change my mind, forget it OK?
- Let's go We'II stop bothering Mr Big Star
- So, now that the stool pigeon has talked, could we find out what was on Doctor Mondoux's paper?
- A small piece of a scientific magazine
- Like any of the hundreds in his office Great!
- Like any of the hundreds, yes
But why that one?
I did some research;
it's from "Neuroscience En Avant"
And guess who's on the cover?
Edouard Paquette
The scientist who's in Great Bear to fix the TV signal
I ordered the magazine from the national Library
- Which will probably get here in two to three days
So, in the mean time
Biron?
In the mean time, tell me the story of the Iumberjacks
- There were twelve guys
- We call them the Iumberjacks but they didn't really have any skills
Kind of the losers of the area
And when you're considered a loser in Great Bear
- Cream of the crop for sure
- The municipality hired them to work on a piece of land where they would have put up a radar station
- A radar station?
But, that's not municipal department
- I just called the mayor's office
The documents about that contract have disappeared from the files
- We have to talk to the mayor, to your father
- He won't say anything
If the documents aren't there, he decided it
If they still exist though, I know where they are
In the safe in his office
- Let me guess; the problem is that he's the only one who knows the combination
- No, the problem is that he's the only one who has the key
And he always keeps it on him
- I have good news and bad news
- The bad news?
- There's no doubt The waves producing the images on TV are of identical nature to the ones I was obtaining with my device, ten years ago
- incredible The good news?
- I've identified what could be the emitting source or at Ieast a relay
Those dishes down there
- We're getting closer
- Who could be doing that?
AII of my ex-coIIaborators have been contacted, it's beyond me
- exactly Whoever is doings this is beyond you Paquette
I find this most exciting
The more reason for me to worry
I don't want to interview Edouard Paquette
I just want to talk to him for two minutes
What's the difference?
Listen, can you just tell me where I can find him?
- Even Gastonne can't talk to him
OK, after "Got cells"?
"Be there where the thief dances"
What does that mean?
Every time we get a lead, it goes absolutely nowhere
We have a new sentence which gives us a new lead and it's a complete mess
- No, no Biron
Those leads don't stop, they slow down
And they all point in the same direction
- Oh yeah?
Which one? - I don't know yet
But I trust blanche's clues
- So, go join Pierre Lamy's gang
- The hairdresser?
actually, I'm certain we'd find very interesting things in that book he took from blanche's house
- blanche's big book is full of old wives' tales spread over thirteen generations
- Biron, to solve a problem, you have to go back to its origins
You have to cut it at the root
Fine OK
Not only are the leads we have absolutely ludicrous, they're cold as ice
The only concrete facts we have are the article about Edouard Paquette found in Doctor Mondoux's hand and the missing file on the Iumberjacks
- Edouard Paquette, don't you find that strange?
A neurologist to fix a TV signal problem?
- That accident always seemed very strange to me
And now, the TV freaks out
We have to open BeIiveau's safe
- No, that's illegal
- I don't give a damn
At least, it isn't "esoteric blah blah"; it's concrete stuff
- Picking the Chief of police's pocket never did anybody any good
I have an idea
BeIiveau might be the chief
hello?
This is EmiIe Biron, yes
You wanted Louis-Bernard Lapointe for your gala?
You shall have him
- Out of the question!
- Under one condition
- No, no, no!
- Did you hear what Armand said on TV?
He's in deep shit
- Christian, the merchandise isn't for you
- To be a good salesman, you have to know your product
- We only have one buyer and they're very satisfied;
it's not necessary
- only one buyer, for now But I have some expansion projects
- Georges, your son is completely stoned
- Never mind Christian
What were you doing with Lapointe?
- What, Lapointe?
- Yes, Lapointe
- Yes - You spend a Iot of time with him
- I'm not denying it either
He's a charming man, we have a Iot in common
Anyway, it's none of your business anymore Georges
- A Iot in common! We have a son; we have a family in common What do you want; you want us to get married?
Then we'II get married
- No, you don't understand
- Mr Ferron!
We're ready
- Where are you? Who are you talking to?
There's an emergency here, Christian isn't in any shape
montreal will be phoning in two seconds
- I'II call you later, OK?
Love you
Christian Ferron
hello
- Christian, you'II have to admit that our second date can't be any worse than the first
- Did you know that your voice is really sexy?
- I won't say I've never been told before
I have a feeling we'II get along, you and I, Christian
Our deal will go a Iot smoother this time, right?
- The first time, we didn't know each other
I've told you my name, what's yours?
- call me Bird - It's Dove, isn't it?
- What?
- I guessed it, didn't I?
Your voice is so soft, it suits you, Dove
- You don't scare me with your big guns
You don't want to tell me your real name?
I'II call you Dove - OK
- Dove?
help, somebody!
HeIène, HeIène!
I just want him to come back blanche
Make him come back, I beg of you!
Hush, you can't make any noise
people will hear you, stop it
I don't know what I was expecting by coming here so late tonight, if only to see you again for a moment
Hope to see you soon
Sarah is asleep
Don't worry, things will work out
- I just wonder where Great Bear is going without blanche
- To hell most likely
But you know, she isn't really gone yet
- You feel her too?
But it's like she's mute, like Sarah
- Do you know why the Natives never settled near Great Bear?
- No
- When I was young, one of my really old great-aunts came to visit from holland
My grandfather showed her around the mine and the town
In those days it was still the "Von Trieck Mine"
He was proud
Then my great-aunt, who had pretty much the same powers as blanche, asks my grandfather what "refracting stones" are
So my grandfather explains;
refracting stones are rocks used to build chimneys, stones that you can heat up as much as you want they will never crack
When she hears that, my great-aunt is overtaken by vertigo and starts shouting: "Stop!
Stop!"
You should have seen it;
the guys in the mine were freaking out
So my grandfather takes her by the shoulders and asks her:
"What's the matter?"
She manages to catch her breath, and all cross-eyed, starts saying: "You shouldn't move this rock, it is rock that never burns;
God put it there to block the gates of hell
If you keep digging, demons from the abyss will come to the surface and torment you "
Then my grandfather grabs her, shoves her in the truck and says: "Crazy old woman, go back where you came from, you prophet of doom!"
well, you know what?
The Natives had the same legend Pretty much word for word
That's why they never settled near Great Bear
- So what?
You think that
- I think I don't like prophets of doom!
- Come on, BIanche wasn't a prophet of doom!
- How would you know, Ferron?
No, but really
How would you know?
- Rum and Coke, just the way you Iike it
I'm glad you came by
I have things to be forgiven for
- Oh yeah?
What's that?
- You can go
I'm not keeping you
- You know very well what I want
- You know very well that I won't give it to you
You'II have to wait until the deal is done to get your share, like the rest of us
- I need money to leave town
And if Dove knows I'm involved, it's not good for you either
- I know, but if Dove finds you, she'II kill you
So I bet you'II make sure she doesn't know you're here
See how much I trust you?
- I'm not alone in this
What about Christian?
Do you really trust him?
- He's my son
I'm giving him a chance to earn my trust
Lay low for a few days and everything will be fine
- You like it?
- Huh? What?
- You like it, eh?
- Yes, yes, yes, EmiIe, EmiIe!
EmiIe, EmiIe!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Let's go
- Where?
- I don't know
AII she said was: "I have to talk to you"
then she hung up Come on, hurry up!
- No, I'm much better now
I should be going
You got what you wanted?
Yeah
It's been clear, lately, that I will never have anything else
Even this, I didn't think anyway
- emile
What Lapointe said about me That I'm an opportunist and unhappy
- Ah, forget about that
- No, no, there's truth in that, I know
But I'd Iike you to give me a second chance, because
I don't want to stay unhappy
Think about it, OK?
Yeah, OK
I'II think about it
She's here
- would you stop saying "She"?
- He, she it doesn't matter
- Forgive me girls I haven't slept in two days
I'm translating the book
- And what does it say?
- A Iot of things but
This isn't blanche's book
- What do you mean, it isn't blanche's book?
BIanche gave it to you
- She didn't give it to me
I took it
- So, what does that change?
- You stole it
That changes everything
He's not the heiress to the powers
- explain yourself
- Every one of these books was written over thirteen generations
- Yes, one chapter per generation, and?
- The thirteenth chapter of this book has already been written
- Then blanche wrote the thirteenth
- blanche didn't write in this book
And she didn't write the thirteenth chapter of any book
- What do you mean?
- Get it out of here!
Get it out!
- Take the book outside!
Pierre, Pierre, it's all right
It's OK, it's all right
We have to get him to the hospital
Go look in the back, there must be a wheelbarrow
We'II roll him to the car
The
The book is gone
Are you sure?
At dawn on a spring day in 1528, a Spanish fleet from Cuba prepared to land an army of conquistadors on the shores of North America,
They had come to find new lands of gold
It was Thursday the 14th of April, 1528, when they came ashore.
The beginning of the most disastrous of all the expeditions of the conquistadors, and yet one of the great epic stories in the history of the Americas.
The Spanish had called this Florida, the land of flowers,
But they found a strange and evil country,
That summer, over 300 conquistadors struggled through these swamps,
Their leader, Panphilo de Narvaez, was arrogant and incompetent,
They had no interpreters, Their food supplies ran out,
And worse, they were picked off by hostile tribes,
The last survivors of those native peoples are still here, the Seminole,
They have fiercely defended their independence ever since,
So you are the only Native American people within the USA who never submitted...
Right. The only tribe to never sign a treaty of submission.
The elements of Florida, a very, very good ally.
Snakes and alligators, Europeans worried more about them.
Again, these people had no knowledge of Florida.
Narvaez had been licensed by the King of Spain to discover and conquer Florida,
He hoped to find cities here with large populations and gold
Instead, he found a poor landscape totally unsuitable for colonisation,
But he pushed his army on further into the nightmare,
"If only Narvaez had come here to seek the well-being of the Indians, " one Spaniard wrote, "and not to wade through their blood to gain ill-gotten wealth, "
But his capacities did not come up to his dreams,
With autumn coming on, the expedition was on the point of collapse,
Hoping now just to save their lives, they struggled down to the sea below Tallahassee,
But there was no sign of their ships,
The fleet had given them up for dead
They're starving, disillusioned, and Narvaez weighs up the situation.
He thinks the Spanish settlements in Mexico are only a few leagues down the coast.
In fact, they're 1,000 miles.
So he decides to build boats to escape.
And on the 22nd of September, nearly 300 survivors set sail in five barges.
(THUNDER)
In terrible weather, they tried to sail across the Gulf of Mexico, past the Mississippi,
Narvaez himself was never seen again,
We would know nothing of this story, but for the captain of one of the barges, a young Spanish gentleman called A lvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca,
Cabeza de Vaca wrote a remarkable account of his adventures and with it we set out to follow him across the Gulf of Mexico, to find out which way wind and tide might have taken him that autumn,
He was coming out of this part of Florida,
The green arrows indicate the current and speed and, as you see, it gets pretty swift.
- Along the Mississippi delta.
- The arrows show the predominant direction?
The predominant direction of the current.
0ccasionally, a lot of fronts come through, push the wind offshore and those tend to be very strong winds that'll push offshore.
The predominant wind is from the southeast.
That's interesting.
When they pass the Mississippi mouth, they get caught up in a storm coming from the north that blows them right out to sea and nearly drowns them, in fact.
"In the end," says Cabeza de Vaca,
"we commended ourselves to God and the dangers of the sea,
"And there was not a man among us who did not think that death was certain,
"None of us had any idea of havigation,
"For six weeks we were lost, "eating rotten maize, drinking sea water, which drove some men mad
"I was at the helm that night, I had prepared to die,
"And then, in the darkness, we heard breakers, "We were near land"
It was the 6th of November, 1528,
At dawn, they came inshore,
But the boat capsized in the surf,
Too weak to swim, some of the men were drowned
They found themselves on a windswept shore unseen before by white men,
Galveston Island, Texas,
How far up do you think they went?
You know, given how weak he was, I don't think he probably went much further than you're going.
0ne of them climbed an oak tree to see where they were,
- I can see it!
I can see the bay!
- Yeah.
I think they guessed the island was about half a league wide.
Maybe a mile and a half or so. That would be about right, would it?
- At the widest point.
- Yeah.
And then they could actually, on a good, clear day like today, see the mainland across the bay.
And you recognise that you're on an island.
But the island was inhabited by Karankawa Indians.
They were hunter gatherers and they only came here during the fall.
They usually left at the end of February and the beginning of March and would return to the mainland and...
But this was what you might call their winter residence, like the New Yorkers go to Florida.
"We had expected to be sacrificed," says Cabeza de Vaca,
"But when the Indians saw our misery they sat down with us and began to weep, too,
"Those uncivilised, savage men were sorry, for us,
"And they shared what little food they had"
You know, you look at all these great expeditions of the conquistadors and the terrible events that happened in the New World, Pizarro and everything else.
And here is a story where the man begins here on this spot
- to become the other, doesn't he?
- Exactly.
And it's the Indians who give him the first clue to this transformation, isn't it?
They cry for him and he realises the common humanity, don't you think?
They saw people destitute, in pain.
They were moved by compassion to help them and aid them in the process and so they saved Cabeza de Vaca, to their own detriment.
It's...
- They were exterminated in the end. - They were.
The Karankawas began to die of European diseases that same winter,
They vanished for good in the course of the 18th century,
But they kept Cabeza de Vaca alive with the food of the island
That's razor sharp.
So there's an oyster bed running all the way down this little inlet?
Yes, and there are places out here where there are oysters for several miles and, during low tide, they're exposed, probably at the time when they harvested them.
I don't know how many people they were trying to feed, but I wouldn't starve.
The expedition had been scattered to the winds,
The men from another barge were slaughtered by Indians up the coast, one group reduced to eating their dead shipmates,
But Cabeza de Vaca survived on oysters and roots,
This plant...
This is a cattail.
And this is probably what he was speaking of when he said that he was breaking those nuts off to eat.
It is like a nut.
Extraordinary.
It was easy pickings.
They could just walk out and pick it up and there are acres and acres of oysters that are exposed at low tide.
But of the 300 men who left Florida, only four would survive,
(TANN0Y) Please do not walk or stand in front of any vehicle while the vessel is approaching... (MICHAEL) The Karankawas were nomadic, In the spring, they crossed over to the mainland
And they took Cabeza de Vaca with them,
They had thought him a superior man, but with no skills, he was an extra mouth to feed and he became their slave,
He was brutally treated, but they kept him alive,
After five or six years of that life, Cabeza de Vaca decided he'd had enough.
It was time to escape.
Not out to sea, but into the interior.
The interior of Texas at that time was completely unknown to the outside world
But during those years, Cabeza de Vaca had got to know many of the nomadic tribes who lived inland
Some of them he describes for the first time,
Coahuiltecans, Tonkawas, Atakapan,
But that was not all, He'd also discovered that one of the coastal tribes had sheltered three other survivors of the shipwreck, who were still alive,
They met up and made their break for freedom,
Their plan was to walk 1,000 miles to Mexico City,
They couldn 't go south because of hostile tribes,
So they decided to walk to the Pacific, but which way?
It used to be thought that they took a northern route through New Mexico and A rizona, down into Spanish Mexico,
But there's another possibility - that they crossed the Rio Grande near the sea and turned west inside Mexico,
The clues are in Cabeza de Vaca's book, 0ne of the few copies to survive is in San Marcos, and there I met Don 0lsen,
So this is an original copy of Cabeza de Vaca's story?
Yes, it is.
And the page we're most interested in, in the research we did, is page 40.
There are four physical clues, all that happen on the same page here.
There's a mountain of seven leagues, which would be 20 or 21 miles long.
"Una sierra de sieta leguas." Yes.
And the stones there were like scoria of hierro.
- Iron slag. - Iron slag.
Down near the bottom of the page, he finds some trees.
Pines with pinones.
And there again you see the pinones.
And the words that really catch our eye down there are right there.
That means their shells were very thin.
So this is a very particular kind of pine tree.
A very particular kind.
The other two clues are much harder.
He says, "They gave us many small sacks of margarita and alcohol molido."
Now, those are minerals.
People before us have translated that word, or transcribed it, I should say, as margarita, which can mean pearls or pearl mica, which is abundant in the deserts of Arizona and New Mexico and they've used this to support the northern route.
If you look closely, do you see what I see? That word is not margarita.
- The second R isn't the same as the first R.
It has a descender down to the left which prints very faintly.
You see it there?
If you look closely, you see it's actually margaxita with an X.
Margaxita.
What does that mean?
- What that means is iron pyrites.
- Iron pyrites.
So the Spaniards walked into a land rich in minerals, To follow them, we crossed the Rio Grande and entered the desolate landscape of horthern Mexico,
, searching for Cabeza de Vaca's route into unknown America, Just over there.
(READS SPANISH) "We marched along, mountain range seven leagues long."
They walked the whole length of this sierra in one day.
They were the first Europeans to walk across the continent,
They gave us the first account of the people here,
But it's never been traced on the ground
Maybe we can ask them about the pine trees.
Do you want to roll your window down?
(SPEAK SPANISH)
Much of his story, is still misunderstood because we don't know for sure what route he took,
We're looking for the pinones with very, very thin shells.
If we knew his route, then his account might begin to reveal a lost history, of these lands, And now, as then, local knowledge is all,
- The old man knows about them.
- (THEY SPEAK SPANISH)
Muchas gracias.
Gracias.
Bye-bye.
- So the old man knew about them?
- Yeah.
Fantastic.
Great.
We're on the right track.
The old herder had sent us on to a dried-up river bed and there were the pine trees,
- So this is one of them?
- Yeah.
It's amazing to think that paper shell pinon was only identified by science in 1979.
And how easy to imagine the Spaniards feasting on the kernels,
- There's still some on the floor.
- Yeah.
It was the best food they'd had for days,
- This year is not... was not a good season.
- Yeah?
When they're still green, you just grind them up, make a ball and eat them, If they're dry, eat them with the shells too,
(CRUNCHING)
You see how thin it is.
That's what Cabeza de Vaca's talking about.
That's what the Indians here used as food along with the nopal cacti that we passed on the way.
But to clinch his route, we needed to find his mountain of iron,
The locals sent us up a place called Mercado, the hill of wealth, 5,000... more than 5,000 feet up the mountain.
Cabeza de Vaca says the people here smelted metals,
They gave him a worked copper bell,
There are copper deposits here and there's also a huge quarry,
It's golden brown with iron ore, Strewn with pyrites and iron slag,
So this whole vast excavation here has been done for the iron?
Yes, they've dug out this, made the hole.
Then some rocks have fallen in from the sides.
(MICHAEL) Some of the other clues you might be able to help on, as a geologist.
They find something, which everybody argues over.
They call it alcohol molido, powdered alcohol, which some people say could be stibnite, lead sulphide.
There's also black manganese around the outside here.
It's called pyrolusite.
The Indians used it as paint.
And that's exactly what Cabeza de Vaca says,
"A black powder used by Indian women to paint their faces, "
0K.
I found it.
Hey, we've got some manganese here.
Fantastic.
So you think this could be it?
Well, it's the kind of manganese we call pyrolusite and it sure comes off black.
Wow.
Brilliant.
I left Monclova feeling sure Cabeza de Vaca had come this way,
He wasn't moving through the nomadic peoples of central Texas,
He was among the settled communities here in north Mexico,
People who lived in houses, worked metals and had long-distance trade,
The ancestors of today's people,
The next few weeks, he tells us, they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry plains into barren mountains,
They were heading northwards now, back up towards the Rio Grande, But they weren't wandering aimlessly,
They spoke the languages and moved from one community to another on ancient trails, which now crossed and recrossed a great river,
These trails are marked on US military, maps from the 1850s, 0ne of them was called the Great Comanche Trail,
Going back down into Mexico, it met the Rio Grande at the Grand Indian Crossing,
These trails can be thousands of years old, maybe even used by the first migrants over 12,000 years ago,
We took an expert guide with us, Linda Walker, and team archeologist Bob Mallouf.
And all along the trail, we found places where human beings had once lived
Cabeza de Vaca's journey had begun to reveal the vanished map of ancient America,
The sheltered part and it probably ran further out.
This is one of the better pictograph sites that we've come up to.
You can see that they're all over this panel.
(B0B) Those are beautiful pictographs.
Late prehistoric pictographs.
- What's late prehistoric?
- 500 AD to as late as 1550.
0n the basis of art size.
We could still make out the finger marks of the artists,
What are they depicting?
This looks like something with legs.
Uh, it...
They're difficult or impossible, as a rule, to interpret accurately, although a lot of people try. 0h.
So could any of these be religious in significance?
We can probably assume that they practised certain kinds of shamanistic religion.
Certainly with healers and this sort of thing.
This was the kind of religion that Cabeza de Vaca and his friends encountered along this route.
And they thought Cabeza de Vaca was a shaman.
They went to him to become healed and they would go to him just like people would go to a medical doctor today and it's possible that could have saved their lives.
What's the lifestyle of these people?
- Well, they're... - (LINDA) Hard.
There wouldn't have been great hospitality at the table in the evening.
(B0B) We have hard archaeological evidence that they would eat just about anything they could get their hands on.
Bob's hard evidence came from the ancient human excrement in the rubbish dumps on these camp sites,
When Cabeza de Vaca said they were eating worms and spiders, he wasn't telling lies,
The Spanish gentleman was tasting the life most humans had lived since the Stone Age,
That night we found a campsite overlooking the desert, , on the great prehistoric route into Central America,
The place was an abandoned Indian settlement,
We found grinding holes, just as Cabeza de Vaca describes,
These are probably 2,000... 3,000 BC to as late as 500 AD.
See they're very tapered... So you have a wooden pounder and pound the seeds or whatever you used inside.
Seeds, mesquite beans, things like that they would ground.
They would ground up in these and powder them to make meal.
- Wonderful.
- These are good examples.
Cabeza de Vaca says these holes were used to grind mesquite beans to make the hallucinogens for the Indian ceremonies,
He also describes the way they cooked food
(LINDA) Look at that.
Boiling the water with hot stones from the fire,
That is hot.
I've never seen that done.
- 0oh.
- There we go.
So they do this because they don't have ceramics.
They don't have...
They can't put a pot on the fire to heat water.
Probably because they moved about frequently.
Pottery is not very conducive to a lot of movement in this country especially, because it's so rocky and it's easily broken.
- So where are the teabags?
- Come on.
- English breakfast or Earl Grey?
- I don't know.
(LINDA) You guys are supposed to be the experts on this, Michael.
As Cabeza de Vaca said, "How diverse and strange are human beings and their ways, "
The four men had now reached the very, middle of the continent, But did they still feel like conquistadors?
Did Cabeza de Vaca, the gentleman?
He had the chance to see this world before it was destroyed by the conquistadors and exploiters who followed But how much he leaves unsaid
(LINDA) Some burritos?
(MICHAEL) Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.
0ne thing that I keep wondering about as we're travelling in the footsteps of Cabeza de Vaca is that he's away for seven or eight years...
You've got some?
Great.
...and he tells us all sorts of fascinating things about the Indians, but he never speaks about his or any of his friends' relationships with the women.
I don't think he would have lived that long in a native society without having taken on a woman and I suspect it wasn't one that was just a short-term scenario either.
It was probably the first infusion of Spanish blood into America.
You can bet he wouldn't mention it, though.
It would have caused him problems with the Church probably.
He had to write this to the audience that were now feeding him, which was Spain.
And he doesn't want them to think that he just ditched Spanish values and went native.
And went, "These values that I was raised with I've now decided are suspect."
No, I don't think he could do that, but I concur with you.
I think there was an unwritten story there.
And so they continued, following the sun, across the ridges of the Sierra Madre,
"Though we could speak six Indian languages," says Cabeza de Vaca, "we found 1,000 differences in their ways of speech,
"But we were always understood and kept our authority with the Indians,
"Though still naked, shedding our skin twice a year like snakes, "
(LINDA) This is a tenaha.
This would hold water year round.
It can be anywhere as deep as ten feet, or as shallow as a foot and a half, but there's always water there.
- (MICHAEL) And it's good water?
- Good water.
(TRADITl0NAL F0LK MUSIC PLAYS) And we finally reached the little town of San Carlos,
Enrique.
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.
We finally made it.
- Do you want a beer?
- I'd love one.
(SINGS IN SPANISH)
- A thrill.
- Yup.
You know what?
It was sure fun.
It had been fun, but it had also told us more about Cabeza de Vaca and the man he was becoming,
Something has happened to him.
He has been transformed somehow.
He is no long either an Indian and he is no longer a Spaniard and a Christian.
He is a new man.
You speak of him as a man situated in between those two cultures.
I suppose, in a sense, he's the first modern man, in a way.
Do you think?
learned something that very few Spaniards knew, that the Indians were human beings.
And many in Spain didn't want human beings at that time.
They wanted slaves.
Everywhere on their journey now, they were treated as people with powers, people who could heal,
To we modern people, this is the least believable part of his story,
And even in his day, he was accused of fantasising, And worse, claiming supernatural powers,
"The Indian healers do their cures like this," he says, "By blowing on the sick person and then using their hands to cast the illness out,
"We did the same, but with the sign of the cross, praying to God to make them better, " And he did
(W0MAN SPEAKS SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) This is the sacred heart of Jesus.
He appears to me when I cure the sick.
0h, and this, this is my protection against the evil spirits who can harm me.
Absolutely wonderful mixture of Christian symbols and yet the way of working with them is much more traditional and Mexican.
It touches back to what was the religion of the whole of the Americas in ancient times, this sort of shamanistic religion.
In a sense, Cabeza de Vaca was the first person to try and cross the boundary between the two and use them both.
"It pleased God to give them health," says Cabeza de Vaca, as a 16th-century, man would
"In the future," he wrote to the King of Spain, "these lands will be brought to the true faith, "And though my story, may be difficult to believe, I assure Your Majesty it is the truth, "
And however we might explain it, thousands of Indians clung to them now, asking for their blessings, walking with them through the wilderness,
The natives were astonished that Cabeza de Vaca and his friends could walk for a whole day without needing food, "But by then," says Cabeza de Vaca, "we were so inured to suffering that we felt no fatigue."
Their guides now led them towards another great native trade route across the Americas - the Shell Trail, which came down from the pueblos of A rizona and New Mexico all the way to the Pacific,
"We saw many towns now," says Cabeza de Vaca, "built by civilised people,"
They were near the ruined city of Casas Grandes,
This astonishing place was once a centre of the shell trade,
The archaeologists found a ton and a half of shells in these warehouses.
Shells for grinding up, for use as decoration on the face of the walls.
Shells for personal adornment, necklaces, bracelets.
Shells like the pink spondylos, which was used for religious rituals all the way along the Pacific coast down to South America.
This place was abandoned a century before Cabeza de Vaca's day.
But the commerce and the trade routes on which it was carried still continued.
Winter was coming on now as they climbed out of the plains,
Their last hurdle, the immense fissured landscape around Copper Canyon,
0ne of the biggest native groups in the Americas still lives here, the Tarahumara,
"The people here are the most open and intelligent folk I met, " says Cabeza de Vaca,
"Their women more modestly and better dressed than in any other part of the Indies we'd seen, "
The Tarahumara are descendents of the peoples who once spread all over the high plains of horthern Mexico,
They have borrowed from the Europeans only a handful of useful things - the violin, the goat, the apple tree and the metal ploughshare,
A plow...
There are no roads through their lands, You still have to go on foot,
They call themselves the people who walk straight, And they mean in their hearts, as well as with their feet,
By now Cabeza de Vaca had seen the first signs of the Spanish presence, an Indian wearing a sword hilt as an amulet,
His world was not far off,
This is where we'll be sleeping tonight.
And jolly comfy it looks, too.
He knew now he must leave the Indian world
But however much he wanted to, he also knew that what he was leaving behind had true worth,
Reading his account, I think that he remained a Christian gentleman,
He still believed in the civilising mission of Spain, but he was no longer a conquistador,
If you had to explain to somebody what it is about this life that is so good, what would the things be that they think are so valuable?
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
He had understood that the peoples of the Americas were human, too,
As the Tarahumara would put it, Cabeza de Vaca had learned to walk straight,
He said, "What's good about life is that there's goat shit.
"There's goat droppings and that's good, "because we put it on the land, so that the corn will be born to make tortillas with, "to make pinole with and to make tesguino with."
I said, "Why do you make tesguino?" He says, "To have a fiesta."
So that you can dance this special dance they do all night, so that God will bring water.
"Why do you need water?" He says, "So that the corn... will be born."
There's the circle. If we kept asking, it would go round.
- Fantastic.
- (SPEAKS TARAHUMARA DIALECT)
(B0B) They don't walk straight any more.
So people like me, we don't walk straight any more?
He says, "Not hardly at all.
Sorry."
But how would Cabeza de Vaca use his knowledge on his return?
The odyssey of Cabeza de Vaca was drawing to its close,
That winter they came down forested canyons towards the Pacific,
After more than 2,000 miles, he was about to reenter the world he'd once known,
"We came down into a wonderful landscape, " he says, "fertile with rivers, forests and fields,
"Nowhere in the world, in our eyes, could be so rich and beautiful,
(CALLS 0UT IN SPANISH)
Cabeza de Vaca ran into Spanish slave hunters,
It's a moment which has been portrayed in novels and films,
(YELLING)
And so Cabeza de Vaca met his old self the man he'd been all those years before,
They threatened to enslave his Indian companions and to kill him, but he stood his ground and forced them to let him and his Indians go,
And finally, nearly ten years after he left Cuba, he walked like a ghost into the town of Culiacan, to the astonishment of the local Spanish colonists,
They had been the first people to walk across the continent,
They'd seen things no outsider had ever seen,
But there's no happy ending to his story,
When he got back to Spain, he argued for benevolent rule in the Americas,
But he was ruined by his enemies and he died a pauper, His only legacy, the book of his adventures,
While he'd been lost, the world had changed as never before,
The conquistadors had carried their swords from Florida to Chile,
Their bravery, and their greed had led them to Lake Titicaca and to the heights of Machu Picchu,
And the cost?
Ancient civilisations overthrown,
Tens of millions dead from European violence and disease, And the plundering of the natural world of the Americas,
(M0NKS CHANTING)
Back in Spain, these events woke the conscience of the age and people now began to question the justice of conquest,
All the great civilisations had treated people not of their own colour or creed as alien,
But now, in Catholic Spain, these assumptions were questioned Did the Indians have human rights?
What does it mean to be human?
In 1550, the King's counsellors gathered here in Valladolid to listen to two great figures of the age, the Dominican Las Casas, speaking for the Indians, and the philosopher Sepulveda, for the mission of imperial Spain,
This is where the debate was held.
It's quite a moment in the history of the world.
The first time that principles of universal human rights and global justice were worked out took place here.
Sepulveda concluded by saying this - that human beings are not equal, that some are superior to others and that the inhabitants of the New World were natural slaves because they were barbarous and inhumane.
"How can it be doubted that they have been justly conquered "by our most humane nation, which excels in every kind of virtue?"
Las Casas spoke second.
Staggered in, an enormous pile of documentation, 40 years of research.
The King's counsellors' jaws must have dropped.
Must have thought he was going to talk for days and he did.
He talked for five days.
And the nub of his argument was this - that the conquests in the New World were wrong and had to be stopped, that the only way was peaceful conversion through love and kindness.
"There's no nation on earth," he said, "no matter how savage, cannot attain humane civilisation.
"All the peoples of the world are human beings.
"And the definition of a human being "is that we are all rational things.
"We share the same faculties of will and capacities and understanding.
"We all take pleasure in goodness.
"The war against the natives of the New World is wrong "because it is unjust to wage war against our fellow humans.
"And all the peoples of the world are human."
(BELL RINGS)
The King listened He ordered a stop to the conquests while the issue was debated further,
But he couldn 't stop history, 0n the ground, the conquests continued, driven, as ever, by the lust for gold
And what of the conquistadors themselves, the men who won the New World
What did they think, looking back?
He died in...
Stuart Sterling's ancestor was one of them,
He fought in the battles in Peru, saw Atahualpa dead, married an Inca princess, But he had blood on his hands,
He wrote this extraordinary document, which he addressed to King Philip II.
0n his deathbed, aged 78, he addressed to the King a remarkable confession,
"I, Captain Mancio Seirra de Leguizamo, make this my last will and testament.
"Firstly, for the peace of my soul, I declare for many years now "I have wanted to speak to His Catholic Majesty, to King Philip.
"I wish Your Majesty to understand the motive that moves me to say this
"is the peace of my conscience, because of the guilt I share.
"For we have destroyed, by our evil deeds, such a government as was enjoyed by these natives "and now they have come to such a pass that these natives, from doing no evil, "have changed to people who now do no good.
"And so I have unburdened my conscience.
"There is nothing more I can do to alleviate these injustices, other than by these words,
"for I'm the last to die of the conquistadors."
In the winter of 1527, a boat arrived at a lonely island off the Pacific shore of South America,
It had come to rescue a ragged band of desperadoes who'd been searching the unknown for lands of gold
Their leader was an old conquistador called Francisco Pizarro,
Pizarro still believes that somewhere to the south there's an undiscovered world.
But his men now have had enough of his promises.
They just want to get out.
"He's a butcher, a savage!
Get us off this hellish beach!"
Then Pizarro gets up and he takes his sword and... draws a line in the sand.
"Friends and comrades," he said, "this side of the line is danger, death, hunger, abandonment.
"This side of the line, comfort and safety.
"That side of the line, go back to Panama and you'll be poor.
"Cross over this side and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams."
13 of them cross over - the glorious 13, they called them.
They would participate in one of the most amazing events in history - the conquest of an empire which until that moment was unknown to the whole world, the Empire of the Incas.
Unlike the Europeans, the Incas still lived in sacred time,
For them, the sun was god and every, day they worshipped his first appearance from the bitter Andean night,
"And we thought this was the whole world," said one of them,
"For we knew of ho other,"
Until the Spanish came,
In 1532, Pizarro returned to Peru with a small private army,
With him were the survivors from his island, his hometown friends and four of his brothers, as close-knit as a Mafia clan,
Ahead of them lay a vast empire and the great Inca himself Atahualpa,
In November 1533, after months of trekking south,
Pizarro reached the foot of the Andes,
We set out to follow in his footsteps,
(HE GREETS HER IN SPANISH)
At first, the local people fed the strangers,
Pizarro himself slept in their houses,
I'll be reasonably comfortable!
I shouldn't have imagined a mattress.
He taught Spanish to two Indians so he could converse in Quechua, the Inca language,
The Spanish gathered their first impressions of this great state and its people,
"How rational the Indians are," said P izarro's secretary,
"The people seem very, obedient to their rulers, "
Here, the Spaniards tasted potatoes for the first time,
Along with more exotic dishesl
There's an old story that in ancient Inca times, there was a period of famine.
The people were starving.
They discovered this furry rodent among the rocks.
It was good to eat and it saved them.
They only eat it for special festivals - religious festivals and so on.
They're doing it today because they've got a foreign guest.
Next day, we loaded up to follow Pizarro into the Andes,
It's an unbelievable thought - Pizarro had 62 horse and 102 foot plus some native allies from further up the coast.
He's entering an empire of five or ten million!
Maybe if he knew, he would go back!
He hadn't seen the Inca army, had he?
Amazing.
Amazing.
He's a canny character, Pizarro.
Illiterate, middle-aged, tough as old boots.
And very, very clever.
He understood that the Incas were a civilisation that, for all its wonders, would be at the level of the Bronze Age and that with guns and Toledo swords he could strike where it really hurt.
The roads of the Inca Empire stretched 3,000 miles, from Chile to Ecuador,
And this one led to the camp of the Inca himself at the town of Cajamarca,
"We followed a narrow steep path," the Spanish said, "straight up to the mountain peaks,"
It's still there, with its Inca steps,
Look at this!
Is this Inca, Ricardo?
Nobody but the Incas made this kind of work.
Look.
I've got the account of Pizarro's secretary of their journey up this pass. He says how steep the pass was.
When they got to the top, it was defended by a fortress surrounded by stone walls, built on a hill with very steep rocks on either side.
That's it!
We're on his tracks!
- Almost nobody knows this place in Peru.
- Really?
It's amazing.
The Spaniards were seeing things no outsider had ever seen,
The last moments of a world untouched since the dawn of history,
After five days' march over the mountains,
Pizarro came out above the town of Cajamarca,
The campfires of the enemy that night were a terrifying sight, the Spanish said.
"Like a brilliantly star-studded sky."
Atahualpa's army, they reckoned, was 30,000 strong,
The Spaniards were on edge now,
Why had they been allowed to come on unopposed
Were they walking into a trap?
Pizarro's secretary, tells the tale,
"Few of us slept that night.
We just talked about what we should do.
"All were full of fear, for we were so few, and so deep into the land.
"And with no hope of rescue."
The Inca, Atahualpa, was taking the waters at the hot springs outside the town, And it was here that the two worlds first met,
The Spanish advance party told A tahualpa that Pizarro loved him dearly and would fight for him against his enemies,
"And he smiled," said the Spanish,
"as if he didn 't think much of us,"
Atahualpa told them they could stay in the town,
0minously, when the Spanish entered the town, they found it empty,
They occupied a building on the square and waited to see what the Inca would do,
Atahualpa's spies had been watching them all the way,
His chief spy, Apu, reported back,
We know, from several chroniclers, what Apu reported.
He reported to his boss the following.
- 0ne, they are not gods.
- Not gods?
- The Inca knew that.
- Doesn't mean the people knew that.
0K? "I have seen them," said Apu, "I have seen how they get tired."
0r sick. And a few of them died.
Gods don't die.
They don't get sick.
But they decided a plan.
They said let's kill them all except three of them, who are going to be castrated.
The horse-breaker,
- the iron man...
- The blacksmith?
The guy who does the horseshoes and the weaponry.
And the barber.
The horse-breaker and the other one, of course, to establish the cavalry of Atahualpa.
But the barber because, Apu said, "He knows something.
He has powers.
"I have seen the people lining up in front of his tent.
"They're tired, really messed up.
"And when they come out, I have seen them rejuvenated, "fresh, health, "and with their skin fresh as a baby's butt."
Yeah!
Atahualpa wanted to have Pizarro for lunch.
But Pizarro had him for breakfast!
Down in the square, as the hours passed, the Spanish still waited
"And I tell you," said one of them, "we were wetting ourselves in terror,"
At last, Atahualpa entered the square on the shoulders of his courtiers,
He was around 30, handsome and intelligent, the red royal tassel on his forehead and a silky soft cloak made of the skins of vampire bats,
It's funny what people remember at such moments of high tension,
The Spanish remembered the lilting song with which the people welcomed him,
It's still sung today at festivals in the Andes,
(RHYTHMIC CHANT)
Pizarro watched with his captains and his priest, Valverde,
Atahualpa took his seat in the middle of the square,
Valverde stepped forward with a cross and a prayer book and made a speech about Christ and the Pope.
He called upon the Inca to abandon his false religion and embrace Christ.
"I follow my religion," said Atahualpa.
"The undying sun and the ancient gods of the Incas.
"What is your authority for your religion?" he said.
The priest held up his book.
"Give it to me," said Atahualpa,
"so I may see if it speaks to me."
He turned the pages carefully and then looked up.
"Why does it say nothing to me?" he said, and he threw the book on the floor.
That was what Pizarro had been waiting for.
It was the moment on which his whole career had converged.
It gave him his pretext for war and he gave the order to attack.
From the porticos all around this square the Spanish came out and opened fire on the masses of people crowded here.
Inca sticks and fans were no match for Spanish guns and steel,
Some said 6,000 people died that night,
As the rain fell, the square ran red with blood
But Atahualpa was captured alive,
They took him in chains to a prison close-by,
It's still there,
And now Atahualpa made an astonishing offer - to ransom himself
If they would set him free, he would fill the room with gold
0n his desert island, had P izarro ever imagined this?
In his wildest dreams? The story's still told and retold across the Andes,
But there are other Inca versions of the story, 0ne of them a unique manuscript discovered only in the 20th century,
(MAN) Thank you very much.
This is it, the famous "Nueva Cronica y Buen Gobierno."
It's really exciting to be facing this document, a document which is unique.
Because here, you not only see things that are valuable for the past, but also things that will help you to understand the present.
The author, Guaman Poma, was a man of Inca descent,
(0SSl0) This is the point of view of a vanquished.
0f one of those Indians who were conquered by the Spanish people.
He's always insisted that the real owners of the Indian territories are the Indians and the Spaniards are the owners of Spain.
And each one in their own realm is perfect.
0rder is perfect.
But if the Spanish come here and pretend to be the owners, then that is representing the disorder of the world.
The world is upside down.
- (W00D) The world is upside down?
- Yeah.
To gather the gold, Atahualpa ordered his people to allow the Spanish to travel freely through his empire,
And the Spaniards set out on the greatest plundering raid in history,
So why did A tahualpa do it?
According to Guaman Poma, the Inca had never seen the strangers as a threat, Now, he thought, if he delivered the gold as promised,
Pizarro would simply go away,
"At that time," says Guaman Poma, "we Indians lost all sense of direction, We forgot our gods "and lost the authority of our rulers,"
So Pizarro's men stripped the gold off the greatest shrines in the Americas,
Atahualpa filled his ransom room with seven tonnes of it, one of the greatest treasures in all of history,
He'd kept his word But what would P izarro do?
Pizarro put Atahualpa on trial for treason, The jury, - the Pizarro brothers and their friends,
The verdict - "The Inca must die,"
"It was the most despicable thing we ever did in the Americas, " said one conquistador,
In the Andes, the people have never forgotten,
(HE SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Corazon?
The heart of a puma, si?
They killed him like a llama.
For the Incas, these events were almost beyond belief
This was a "Pachacuti" - the world turned upside down,
Pizarro now marched his army in triumph south, on the Inca royal road, a thousand miles to the capital of the Inca Empire, Cuzco,
"0n November 15th, 1533,
"we Spaniards reached Cuzco,
"It was a wondrous thing to behold
"No prize ever equalled this,
"The streets were grand, "the palaces of finely-jointed stone blocks of great antiquity, "
It was the richest town in all the Indies, founded by the first Inca and refounded in 1533 by Francisco Pizarro,
And so, at last, Pizarro looked down on his prize,
The city of the Incas, with its great ceremonial square and the huge palaces of the Inca royal clans,
It was a turning point in the history, of the world
The Inca believed this place was the navel of the earth.
It was the sacred centre of the last of the civilisations to arise independently on the planet.
And the fall of the city to the Spanish, coming so soon after the fall of Mexico, seems now like the beginning of the end for the traditional civilisations of the world.
The end of sacred time.
The triumph of profane time.
For Pizarro's expedition was a profit - making venture backed by the bankers of Europe,
From now on, across the Atlantic, the talk was of hothing but Peru and gold
Europe was amazed Spaniards flooded into Peru on a gold rush,
The Pizarro brothers flaunted their new-found fortunes,
For them, these were days of wonder as they tightened their grip on the people and the riches of P eru,
To win hearts and minds, the Pizarros appointed a puppet king, Atahualpa's half-brother Manco,
But the Spaniards treated him with contempt,
To the Incas' horror, Gonzalo Pizarro raped Manco's wife and took her for himself
Word soon spread of a war of liberation,
Manco summoned his leaders to a secret meeting,
Perhaps it took place in the Inca sun temple which still stands today inside a Cuzco church,
Manco's words were recorded by his son Tito Cusi,
"I've summoned you all here," said Manco, "because we all know now clearly who these foreigners really are.
"They're not worthy people sent by God, "but children of the devil.
"We've endured a thousand insults, they treat us like dogs "while swearing to be our friends.
"Now I want you to send your messengers throughout the whole country.
"Summon all your forces to gather here in Cuzco in 20 days' time "to attack them.
"Make sure the bearded ones hear nothing about this "and we'll kill every last one of them.
"Then, perhaps, we may waken from this nightmare."
Manco's plan was a concerted attack all over Peru, Above Cuzco, a vast Inca army gathered in the hills,
The Spaniards were surrounded Cut off in Lima, Francisco Pizarro sent frantic pleas to Mexico for help,
Three relief columns were wiped out by Manco's armies, Here in Cuzco,
Spanish survival hung on whether they could take the Inca fortress which controlled the city at Sacsayhuaman,
The Spaniards were outnumbered and, at times, outfought,
Juan Pizarro was killed But in the end, the Incas were outgunned
The last battle for these walls was fought with a desperate heroism by the Inca warriors.
Like the Aztec battle for Mexico City, it recalls the great classical epics like the "Iliad", the siege of Troy.
The last of the great Inca heroes, they say, stood on top of these rocks armed with a European sword, throwing the Spanish off, killing members of his own side if they thought of surrendering to the Spaniards.
In the end, when it was clearly all hopeless, he threw his weapons down, stuffed his mouth with earth, scourged his face and threw himself off the rocks in fulfilment of his vow that he would die rather than give in to the Spanish.
"And so our encirclement was broken," says Guaman Poma,
"The Spaniards had bought themselves a breathing space, "
The Pizarros now took savage reprisals against the civilian population, the women and children who helped Manco's army,
A massive exodus followed as those who could fled north into the Sacred Valley,
The Sacred Valley was the Inca heartland
Here they built their finest palaces with huge terraces to grow maize and coca leaves,
Here, Manco and his high priest could call on the help of the ancestors,
At Machu Picchu, the mummies of the dead Incas could be brought out of their womb-like chambers to greet the sun,
Their dead eyes regaled as in life with the vistas of the sacred peaks,
- ~Buenos dias!
- ~Buenos dias!
According to Guaman Poma, Manco built new terraces and houses here to feed and shelter the influx of troops and refugees,
You can still see them at 0llantaytambo, with its Inca housing plots and water channels,
The Incas boasted that Manco had made this the strongest fortress in all Peru,
And it was here that the Pizarros launched their next attack,
They fought their way through the narrow lanes of the town,
Then they attacked the fortress which towers above,
The Spaniards now sent their force of commandos up to try and seize the rocks above the fortress.
Hernando Pizarro led the assault up these steps while the Incas rained down missiles, spurred on by Manco, who rode the terraces above on a Spanish horse,
"Suddenly, the Indians hit us from every, side,
"To hear the roar of their army,
"it was as if the mountain was about to crash on top of us, "
For the first time, the Spanish had been beaten in a pitched battle,
"0ne more day and we would have killed them all, " said Tito Cusi,
"My father's men laughed heartily at the Spanish rout "and how we celebrated our victory,"
Manco planned to make a new Cuzco here in the Sacred Valley,
He even built a great council chamber, carved with the royal pumas,
"By such monuments, he hoped to be remembered always, " said Guaman Poma,
But Manco knew that Spanish colonists were pouring into Peru every, month,
Within a year, Manco realised he would have to pull right out of Spanish reach, to the jungles the far side of the Andes,
Peru would be partitioned
It must have been a heartbreaking moment for the young Inca,
When Manco had decided to retreat up the valley into the jungles of Vilcabamba he made a speech to his loyal followers.
A moving speech, too, a little like Bonnie Prince Charlie going over the sea to Skye.
He asked them to remember his ancestors, the Incas of the past, had been good rulers, had cared for the people and provided for them.
"Don't forget that," he said.
"Don't let your children forget it."
Then he said these extraordinary words which are all the more striking now.
"I know," he said, "that one day, in the future, "the time will come when they will force us to worship their gods.
"And when that day comes, "do what you have to do in front of them, but in private don't forget our ceremonies "and our gods.
"And if they try to force you to destroy our shrines, "only reveal what you have to and keep the rest hidden in your hearts."
So the Inca Empire was to be divided
Manco's court and his army began their long march over the Andes, demolishing the road behind them as they went, Nearly 13,000 feet.
Good Lord!
No wonder my hands are freezing cold!
But even now, the Incas still dreamed that one day they might return,
0n the far side of the mountains, Manco hoped to organise a new resistance, As Manco put it, "To free the land of our forefathers,"
Manco destroyed the rope bridge here, The river was to be the boundary, between the two worlds,
But no one crossed the Pizarros,
Gonzalo Pizarro now prepared to hunt Manco down, Manco's line of retreat had led him to a remote jungle hideaway at Vilcabamba, the lost city of the Incas,
With him, Gonzalo took 300 of the toughest conquistadors, more than his brother had led to Cajamarca,
We set out to follow him,
I've now got fleas. You may wonder why I'm scratching my hands.
I've been bitten by the dreaded "puma wacachi" - which is the fly that makes even the puma cry!
- It's got me all over. It's true!
- Puma wacachi!
Me wacachi!
The first stage of our trek in Pizarro's footsteps took us across bleak uplands over the last of the high passes towards Amazonia,
Manco had retired to the farthest corner of the Inca world to create his new kingdom,
(MEN ENC0URAGE H0RSES)
- Is this the Pass Colpa?
- Yes, this is Colpa Pasa.
- The Colpa Pasa?
- Yes.
- What does that mean?
- That's the highest point on the trail.
I'll catch you up in a minute.
The Colpa Pass, the high pass.
About 12,400 feet.
This is the last of the passes before the road goes down and down and down towards the headwaters of the Amazon and down into Amazonia itself.
When the Inca resistance headed this way, they were saying goodbye to their old homeland.
According to Guaman Poma, Manco had pushed new roads into the interior, And on the second day, we found them,
- This looks like Inca steps, yeah?
- Yes, it is Inca steps.
They're quite well preserved up here.
Yeah.
Pizarro now scented blood
"We cannot fail to get Manco now," he said, "dead or alive,"
But Pizarro was too confident and he fell into Manco's trap,
(SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Don Juvenal told us how the Incas had rolled stones down on the Spaniards,
There are still piles of rocks up there,
36 conquistadors were killed
Gonzalo was forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements before he dared push on,
And Manco taunted him,
"I am Manco Inca,
"We have killed 2,000 Spaniards and we will kill you too, and free our country, "
The following day, we came down through the clouds into sodden rainforests,
In places, landslides had taken the path away,
Such conditions must have sapped the morale even of P izarro's hardened conquistadors,
we came in sight of Manco's lost city,
- This is Espiritu Pampa?
- Espiritu Pampa.
Si.
There it is, the Lost Valley of the Incas.
The site of their last city.
It's so secluded, so hidden, you can understand why it was never discovered until the 20th century.
You can understand too why the last of the Incas thought they might be safe here, hidden away from the rest of the world.
Pizarro had had to fight his way this far, But when he got here, the city was empty,
Manco had disappeared into the jungle,
This is la plaza principal, Don Juvenal?
Si, plaza principal.
(D0N JUVENAL SPEAKS QUECHUA)
Today, Manco's city lies scattered over a square mile of forest, so choked with vegetation it takes time to make out the shapes of the buildings,
It's all on such a huge scale.
This is the terracing of the great plaza in the middle of the city on which stood the temple.
They brought all their most sacred relics here from Cuzco - the mummies of the last of the dead Incas, and above all the most sacred relic, the golden image that symbolised the rising sun in whose chest was a heart made of dough
They brought it all here to try to rebuild their world in the jungle.
Gonzalo searched these forests for two months till sickness and starvation forced him to retreat,
By his fingernails, Manco had survived
In his fury Pizarro took revenge,
He ordered Manco's wife shot with arrows and floated her down the river in a basket to be found by the Incas,
Manco was grief-stricken for he had loved her very, much,
Meanwhile, Pizarro's private empire began to fall apart,
Like all Mafia families, the Pizarros had made bitter enemies,
In a scene from "The Godfather", Francisco, the discoverer and conqueror of P eru, was murdered by the son of his first business partner,
Manco, meanwhile, had made his new capital at a place called Vitcos,
Fantastic!
There's the Vilcabamba river.
The Spanish described the place as being on a high mountain with wonderful views over the province of Vilcabamba.
0n top, they say, was a substantial flat area where majestic and sumptuous buildings had been erected with great skill and art.
You can see their ruins even from this distance.
Manco held court here for seven years,
The Spaniards were now fighting among themselves and he sheltered enemies of the Pizarros,
But there was a price on the Inca's head, and in the end they got him,
This is all that remains of Manco's palace.
Here's the finely-sculpted lintels that the Spaniards mentioned.
And here's the plaza where it all happened.
Manco was about to play a game of quoits with horseshoes with his Spanish guests, a game he liked.
His son Tito Cusi tells the story.
"My father was about to throw," he said, "when one of the Spaniards stabbed him in the back.
"He tried to defend himself, but there were seven of them and he was unarmed.
"They stabbed him and stabbed him.
I wanted to defend him," Tito says, "but I was only nine years old.
"They turned on me and I was terrified and ran off into the bushes.
"Though I was wounded in the leg, I escaped.
"But my father was killed."
Manco had been the one Inca who offered hope of long-term resistance.
So the Inca Empire ended.
The political order was destroyed.
But things exist at different levels in history.
And empires are really just on the surface of history.
Below them is a much deeper structure that lasts much longer - the long-lasting, tenacious, deep-rooted culture of the people of a region, shaped by their landscape and climate.
Up here in the Andes, the Inca people survive and the beliefs survive, just as Manco Inca had said.
The people themselves did not forget.
Nearly 500 years on, the people of the Andes still revere the ancestral spirits of the Incas,
Every June, they go up in their thousands onto the glaciers of the Sacred Mountains,
Just before dawn, at a breathless 16,000 feet, they worship the ice of Qoyllur Riti, the Lord of the Snow Star,
And afterwards, like their Inca ancestors, the people greet the rising sun,
And then they sing the lilting song they sang to Atahualpa all those years ago,
"When the last Inca is dead," said old Francisco Pizarro, "the people will weary, of resistance "and take our part,"
"In the beginning," said the Aztecs, "the white men came in one boat,"
Nearly 500 years ago,
Spanish adventurers landed on a small island off the coast of Mexico,
It was the first contact between the civilisations of the old world and the new,
The prelude to one of the greatest events in history,
It's a story of almost incredible endurance, heroism, greed and brutality.
And all the more poignant today as we see its long-term effects unfolding across the globe.
It's known still in the Americas as the conquest, the "Conquista".
And the larger-than-life men who achieved it are the conquerors, the "Conquistadors".
"Most mighty prince," wrote Hernan Cortes to the King of Spain,
"Let me begin at the beginning, We sailed our ships to the land called Yucatan, "
Cortes was a poor boy from a small town, trained in law, not war, But he had dreams,
A self-made man, he'd financed his own expedition - 11 ships, 500 soldiers,
Like Columbus, he didn 't know what lay ahead
He thought the land they could see beyond Cuba was just islands, through which they could sail to China,
It was April 1519,
Gracias!
It's hard for us to imagine the shock of the new for people of the 16th century,
For us, it would be like landing on another planet,
To discover that the New World also had great civilisations, with law, writing and architecture, this was a revelation,
"What rational beings live here?" Wrote Cortes,
"This is the best and richest land that ever there was, "
The awe-struck conquistadors christened one place "El Gran Cairo",
Cortes headed west to the Tabasco river, the frontier of the Mayan and the Aztec-speaking worlds,
Still perhaps unsure of his next move, he landed in Frontera,
The key to any close encounter is language, But Cortes couldn 't talk to the Aztecs,
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
He'd already found a Spanish sailor who spoke Mayan,
Then, here in Frontera, he had his lucky break,
Cortes was given a slave girl by a local chief Her name was Malinali, but here in Mexico everyone calls her "Malinche",
Malinche spoke Mayan and Nahuatl, the Aztec language, Through her, he could talk to them,
(W0MAN SPEAKS SPANISH)
(TRANSLATl0N) Malinche was treated well by the Spanish.
Especially by Cortes.
Some say she fell hopelessly in love with him.
- Afrodisiaco, #si?
- Si.
Yes, some say she was dazzled by the power of Cortes.
And how she's paid for itl "Traitor, whore, goddess of death,"
For nearly 500 years, Mexicans have argued about Malinche and her relationship with Cortes, But Malinche was the one who would lead Cortes to his destiny,
Cortes sails on up the coast, Malinche at his side,
He keeps asking about gold And everywhere they tell him of a mysterious empire in the interior,
A land called Mexico,
He anchors at an island off the coast, "The Isle of Sacrifices", , just off the modern port of Vera Cruz,
And it was here that Cortes had his first encounter with the Aztecs,
In his letters, you can still feel his sense of wonder,
Since then, the tale has become a myth, It's even immortalised in the movies,
0n Easter Saturday 1519, a magnificent embassy arrived from the ruler of Mexico,
Even more strange, they seemed to have been expecting Cortes,
Dona Marina, find out who honours us in this royal manner.
Yes, my lord.
(THEY SPEAK NAHUATL)
Malinche translates their Nahuatl,
Tell the royal ambassador I am pleased to welcome him to my camp.
To his amazement, the Aztecs offer him wonderful gifts of gold
Though Cortes was pretending to be the ambassador of a great king, he couldn't respond in kind and as gifts to the Aztecs, he scraped up a chair, some trinkets and a velvet cap which their ambassador accepted, though he looked at them as if they were excrement!
Then came the crucial moment in the conversation.
"Do you have more gold?" says Cortes.
"Because we suffer from a disease of the heart that can only be cured by gold."
"Yes, we do," said the ambassador.
There could hardly have been a more dangerous admission.
Cortes now gave the Aztecs a show of his power,
He fired his guns, rode his horses down the shore,
The Aztecs were stunned They'd never seen such things before,
Their ambassador had his artists paint them, as we would take photographs,
"The strangers," he said, "have sticks which spurt fire,
"They ride deer, high as a house, which snort and foam, "
Cortes was invited to make a camp, He built a base here at Villa Rica,
You can see it all from here.
The little bay, the little headland where they built their fort.
Tiny, isn't it? Just a first enclave in the New World.
But it all started from here.
And perhaps it was only now that Cortes dreamed up the plan to go to the city of the Aztecs,
Could he somehow get them to bow to Spain?
Those nights by the sea, the locals told him of what lay ahead
How the Aztec empire was built on fear and tribute,
A tribute not only of things, but of people, 0f human hearts,
The name of the Aztec ruler was Montezuma,
But Montezuma was haunted by a prophecy, a legend of an exiled god who one day would return to reclaim his throne,
So the Aztec spies urgently looked for signs,
The strangers' white food Was it food of the gods?
Their pale faces, could they be divine?
It sounds incredible, and it probably sounded incredible to the Spanish, but Aztec gods weren't like Christian ones.
They were more like the gods of the ancient Greeks, capricious, wilful, mercurial, cruel.
And the most enigmatic of them all was Quetzalcoatl.
And according to the legend, when Quetzalcoatl was expelled from Mexico, he promised that one day he would return and regain his kingdom.
That he'd come back across that sea out to the east, back here, with his chalky white face and his beard in the Aztec year 1-Reed.
By an amazing chance, 52 to 1 chance this was that year!
And for the Aztecs, nothing happened by chance,
Cortes's men are getting nervous now, They know a great empire lies inland, and they know Cortes wants to go there,
He acts fast, Kills the ringleader, Then, so no one can get away, he decides to pull his ships up on the beach and scupper them,
It's a gambler's throw, isn't it, destroying your own ships!
They won't talk about going home any more.
Typical piece of Cortes.
He knows what he needs to know about the Aztecs.
But to persuade his men into the interior, he needs to hitch them to his dreams.
To leave them, as he put it, with nothing to rely on but their own hands and the assurance that they must either conquer or die.
The hesitation was over, Cortes heads inland with some native allies from the coast who were keen to throw off the Aztec yoke,
He took a back road towards Montezuma's capital, Tenochtitlan, hoping along the way to find friends among Montezuma's enemies,
The towns they came through are still here - Coatapec, Xico,
"Every place we passed through," says the conquistador Bernal Diaz, "we saw altars for human sacrifice, By some, there were thousands of skulls, "
The Christian in Cortes was revolted
Here in Xico, he told the people they must give up their idols,
Speaking in Nahuatl, the Aztec language,
Malinche gave a potted history of Christianity.
Then she explained to the people the pope gave the King of Spain authority over their lands in the name of God.
There's a story that two chiefs who heard this were prepared to believe that there was one all-powerful God, but as for the idea that the pope had given their lands to somebody else, the pope must have been drunk!
The Spaniards were still trying to make sense of confusing signs,
The stench oo blood mingled with the scent of flowers,
Familiar European categories of life and death, nurture and feeding, were upside - down,
To quench their thirst, the Spaniards were given juice bled from the fleshy white heart of the Mage cactus,
Wow! It's absolutely beautiful.
0nly to learn this was the drink given to sacrificial victims to dull the senses of those who were about to die,
"Every, day,"says Bernal Diaz, "we were told they'd kill us "and eat our flesh with chillies, "And the warm drink made from the cacao bean,
"was prepared for the eagle warriors who feasted on the flesh of their enemies, "
Whilst human sacrifice is long gone, chocolate is still drunk here at religious feasts,
(W0MAN SPEAKS NAHUATL)
That's "Buenas tardes"?
How do you say "Gracias"?
(SHE TRANSLATES T0 NAHUATL)
Amazing!
And with the language, hints of Aztec attitudes to love and sex,
For all their obsession with death, the Aztecs still loved life,
(IN NAHUATL) We'd better not... (HE REPEATS HER W0RDS)
I can't tell you what that means!
Cortes pushed on, And now we had to follow him on foot,
"Ahead of us, " says Cortes, "we saw a great range oo beautiful mountains, "the peaks so white we think they must be covered with snow, "
With him, Cortes had 300 conquistadors, 40 of them crossbowmen, 20 musketeers,
There were several hundred Indians, and Cuban servants, And, of course, his precious horses - 15 of them,
After a summer on the Caribbean coast, the Spaniards were in for a shock,
0ne of the conquistadors, Bernal Diaz, said when they came into the mountains, it rained and rained.
The path turned into torrents.
All they had was their cotton armour for the tropics.
They were unprepared for the change of temperature, going up 11,000 feet.
Soaking wet and freezing cold, some of their Indian servants died.
So far as we know, Cortes had no military, training, But he never lost the respect of those who marched with him,
The thing you have to remember about the conquistadors is that, putting themselves through this, they were all volunteers.
They were in it not for religion but a share of the profits.
They were free men.
They acknowledged their leader's authority but he had to pay attention to and respect them.
And they called each other "compadre".
Comrade.
They're all in it together.
- Is that the path up here?
- Eh?
- That's the path, is it?
- Yes.
That little path up to the top,
Cortes called it "Nombre de Dios" - "The name of God."
(RAIN DR0WNS 0UT W0RDS) 13,000 feet!
Can't see...
~Muchas gracias!
Those nights, the native women he'd brought from the coast made them tortillas,
Some compensation,
We have tents tonight and we are certainly going to be soaking, cold and miserable, just as Hernan Cortes and his men were, as Bernal Diaz tells the story.
Those clouds are not going to lift.
As they marched deeper inland, they heard more about what lay ahead
"The locals said that to capture Mexico would be impossible, " says Bernal Diaz, "and we would all die, "But the more they told us that, the more we longed to try, our fortune, "
After the mountains, though, things got no better,
Through autumn hailstorms, they trekked across a desolate plain of salt lakes with no food or water,
Cortes was heading for the fertile land of Tlaxcala,
Tlaxcala was an independent city state,
They hated the Aztecs,
Cortes was hoping they'd shelter him, but his luck was out,
They attacked him in a savage battle, 0n the battlefield, they still plough up the debris,
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.
Estoy buscando la ruta de Hernan Cortes.
#La batalla?
#Es aqui?
Ah!
~Si, si, si!
Looks like glass, but this is obsidian.
See the sharp edge?
They had a row of these things set into the wood of the clubs that they used.
Nasty wound, but nothing like Spanish steel.
"There were 149,000 of them," Cortes wrote to the King, in Julius Caesar mode,
It was touch and go, He hung on grimly on this little hill for two weeks,
Then, with their own losses mounting to the Spanish guns, the Tlaxcalans offered him a deal,
They welcomed him to their town and laid on a fiesta, even offered their daughters in marriage,
The Tlaxcalans had realised that these strangers with their guns could help free them from the Aztecs,
Ever since, they've been accused by other Mexicans oo betraying their country, But of course, that's not how they see it,
(MAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
(TRANSLATl0N) Xicotencatl, the elder, reaches for Hernan Cortes who returns the embrace, but doesn't let go of his sword.
The old Xicotencatl knew the future of his people was at stake.
He believed this alliance would ensure that Tlaxcalans would not disappear from the map, would not disappear from history.
The alliance of the Tlaxcalans is the turning point of the whole story, the turning point in the history of the New World.
With them, Cortes found allies who hated the Aztecs and would fight them to the death.
Allies who would give him support, provisions and manpower.
The possibility of conquering Mexico was now on.
So Cortes marched on, with several thousand Tlaxcalan warriors behind him,
To the greatest pilgrimage city in the Americas, Cholula, under the volcano Popocatepetl,
These were friends of the Aztec ruler Montezuma, and the Tlaxcalans warned Cortes to expect trouble,
As the Spanish moved through the town, they saw roadblocks in the side streets.
Piles of stones heaped on the rooftops, women and children evacuated.
Then Malinche heard a story that a plot was being hatched to ambush Cortes.
He decided on a pre-emptive strike.
He summoned the 100 lords of Cholula to meet him in the temple of Quetzalcoatl - it's now the Church of San Gabriel - and there Malinche told them in Nahuatl that they'd committed treason and they'd die.
The doors were closed.
The Spaniards killed them all.
And they killed 3,000 more Cholulans assembled outside.
Then their Tlaxcalan allies sacked the town.
"And so death came to Cholula," says the Aztec account,
"When we got the news, we were seized with fear,
"It was as if the earth itself were shaking,"
"My heart burns as if it 's been washed in chillies, " said Montezuma,
From Cholula, Cortes continued up the old track through the forests of P opocatepetl,
It was erupting then, as it is now,
into the valley of Mexico,
In the distant haze, they began to make out a vast blue lake, And then, at last, far away, approached on immense causeways, was the city of Cortes' dreams,
"It seemed like an enchanted vision," wrote one of his men,
"Indeed, some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream,
"It was so wonderful "that I do not know how to describe this first glimpse "of things never heard of seen or dreamed oo before,
"The city had traders and warriors, priests and lawyers, "musicians, jugglers, courtesans and scribes,
"It was the most beautiful thing in the world, " wrote Cortes,
Believe it or not, that's where the causeway came in in the 16th century!
This is where the lake ended and the city began.
This is where Cortes walked that November 1519.
The Aztec city started here.
To find the place where Cortes and Montezuma met, you have to go right into the commercial heart of modern Mexico City,
The site today is inside the Hospital of Jesus,
To get there, you have to go through Accident and Emergencyl
The Aztecs led the Spanish into a great courtyard framed by a beautiful building that was on this spot.
The tale of that momentous meeting is told by the Aztec eye-witnesses,
This is where the two worlds met.
It's where Montezuma addressed Cortes.
"0h, my lord," he said,
"you are fatigued, you are weary after your long journey.
"At last you have come down to earth.
"You have come to your city of Mexico which I have guarded for you for a little while.
"They said you would return, and now you have done so.
"But first, go to your palace and rest.
"And go in peace."
Mysterious words, but what do they mean?
Was this the language of Aztec diplomacy?
0r Montezuma's acceptance of destiny?
No one knows,
But in the Aztec calendar, that day, the 8th of November, was 1-Wind, the day of Quetzalcoatl, a day of robbery violation and deceit,
And the Aztecs knew that nothing ever happened by chance,
"It was as if we'd all eaten stupefying mushrooms, " say the Aztec witnesses,
"We kept our children off the streets and the city went to sleep
"in a fearful slumber,"
The city woke as it always had
In the streets of the modern world, we can only dimly imagine its splendour,
The flutes and conch shells greeting the dawn, the bustle of merchants, the thousands oo blooms carried each day to markets drenched in the scents of the Americas,
The Spaniards were open-mouthed at the sights, the gleaming stucco of the palaces and pyramids,
They wandered the courtyards, gawped at strange gods,
But on the wind, with the scent of flowers, they caught the ever-present smell of death,
And in their hearts, they feared that Cortes the gambler had led them into the jaws of hell,
Montezuma, though, was still unsure who Cortes was, and who his master was, the great King Charles across the sea,
So now Montezuma proudly shows Cortes the pyramid of the war god on whose summit thousands of captives had had their hearts cut out, Perhaps the gods would recognise each other?
Trying hard to appear calm, the Spaniards entered the chamber,
The first thing the Spanish noticed when they came inside was the disgusting smell.
As their eyes got used to the darkness, they saw the eyes of the Aztec gods staring at them, gleaming with precious stones.
The war god, Huitzilopochtli, was sitting down with a golden bow and arrow.
In front of him was a brazier full of human hearts, still warm.
All around, the walls were encrusted with dried blood.
Cortes then said this to Montezuma -
"I don't understand how a prince as great as you "and a man as intelligent as you, could think that these are gods.
"They are bad things called devils "and I'd like your permission to put a cross and a picture of the Virgin Mary in here."
Montezuma took offence at that.
"If I thought you were going to be so insulting to our gods, "I would never have brought you to see them.
"We hold these things to be good.
"They bring us health, harvest, rain and water "and we must sacrifice to them.
"So please don't mention this again."
It was quite a gulf
For the Christians, God gave his blood to redeem mankind
For the Aztecs, mankind must give its blood to redeem the gods,
A week passed Cortes had to act,
He raises the stakes with an unbelievable gamble,
At gunpoint he arrests Montezuma,
"What we want you to do is to come over to the palace where we're lodging.
"Quietly and with no fuss.
If you raise the alarm, we will kill you."
Montezuma is amazed.
Nothing he learned in the Palace of Nobles prepared him for this.
"My person cannot be taken prisoner," he says to Cortes.
"Even if I were to like it, my people would never accept it."
The argument goes on for four hours, Montezuma in tears at one point.
All the while, Cortes's captains are pacing up and down, getting more and more nervous.
0ne of them says, "Either he comes with us now or we kill him now."
And when Malinche translates that, Montezuma caves in.
Montezuma was now in Cortes' power, maybe under his spell,
He continued to issue orders as if things were normal, but he'd lost the trust of his people,
The tale has been told many times,
How the angry, mob besieged the Spanish, how Cortes bullied poor broken Montezuma to plead with them,
But Montezuma's aura had drained away and his people killed him,
The Spaniards were trapped inside the city, food and water cut off,
His dream slipping from his grasp, Cortes was forced to give the order to escape,
You have to remember the city was on an island completely surrounded by water, linked to the mainland only by three great causeways.
All the bridges had been broken by the Aztecs.
So in those final few hours, the Spaniards built a portable wooden bridge out of the ceiling beams of where they were staying.
They would leave at midnight.
The night was clear, with a gentle rain,
The Spaniards marched in silence, hugging their gold
Half-way into the lake, they were spotted
The alarm was raised and the city woke,
Cortes was trapped The Aztec witnesses name the place, Today it's by the little post office on the Tacuba road
Three quarters of the Spaniards were left behind - 800 men - killed, drowned or captured.
The captives could expect only one fate at the hands of the enraged Aztecs.
They were taken back into the city to the Great Pyramid.
There their hearts were cut out and offered to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war.
0n the far shore, Cortes gathered the survivors by a huge ceiba tree, It's still there,
Malinche, they say, showed no emotion,
But Cortes, for once, couldn 't control his feelings,
They said there were tears in Cortes' eyes that night, "the night of tears".
But of all his comrades who died, he asked after only one -
Martin Lopez, the shipbuilder.
When Cortes heard that Lopez had survived, although badly wounded, he said, "Vamos.
Que nada nos falta."
"0K, let's go. For we lack nothing."
"And when the Spaniards had thus gone," say the Aztecs,
"we thought they had gone for ever and would never return, "
But across the mountains, the Tlaxcalans stood by Cortes,
And what he does now is one of the most amazing things in history,
In the middle of the land, he builds a fleet,
That's why he needed Martin Lopez,
They're going to build 13 brigantines.
All of them are more than 40 feet long.
Then they'll take them to bits and carry them to Mexico City!
What does the maestro think about this?
(TRANSLATl0N) They disassembled the fleet as there are no navigable rivers round here.
For Mexicans, Cortes was a very cruel man.
But from a buccaneering point of view, he was great!
Cortes would not let go of his dream,
And now, inexorably, the net began to tighten around the Aztecs,
Cortes transports his prefabricated fleet, carried in pieces by a train of 8,000 Tlaxcalan porters,
Across the mountains and back to the lake,
0n the lake shore, he waited, reinforced now by thousands of hative allies,
It was May 1521,
Cortes' moment of destiny had arrived
It was to be nothing less than a war of the worlds,
Cortes' plan was to lay siege to the city and cut off its food and water supplies, Then, supported by his ships, he would attack it along the causeways, whose line is still marked today by the main routes into the city,
It was a new kind of warfare for the Mexicans, involving the ordinary population, women and children, starving them.
This wasn't part of war in ancient Mexico, but Cortes was a modern man.
It was total war, The siege lasted for 80 days,
A quarter of a million people were reduced to eating lizards and grass,
Devastated by European diseases, the Aztecs under their new king, Cuauhtemoc, still refused to negotiate and the Spanish had to win the city street by street,
In the last battle, the Aztecs were squashed into the warren of streets round the Great Pyramid in the north, in Tlatelolco,
I'm looking for the ancient barrios of Mexico City, not the modern ones.
I want to go to the area of Tepito.
- Tepito?
- Yeah. Do you know it?
Yes, but it's a little dangerous.
You don't care?
- Well...
You know it?
- Yeah.
- Yacacoco?
- No.
- Lacolchoko?
Amashak?
- No, I don't know anything about it.
- Do you have a map?
- Yes.
Show me.
Maybe I can help...
Jesus Christ.
What kind of map is that?
- It's from 1772!
- You have a rum deal, man!
Mexico City's got a bit bigger since then!
0K.
It seems crazy, but this map, drawn in 1772,
Mexico City is still inside what was the old island.
You can still see the network of canals and the main roads of the Aztec city are still there.
To the end, the Mexicans viewed the Spaniards as contemptible people who killed brave warriors at a distance with guns,
In the Aztec calendar, the final day was 3-Serpent, the beginning of the time of lamentation and remembrance,
The day human beings were reminded of their place in the remorseless cycle of time,
This is where the war ended, the exact spot.
This little church was built on the place where Cuauhtemoc surrendered.
I find the Aztec version of this story as powerful and moving as Homer's "Iliad", the tale of Troy.
The Aztecs accept their fate without a trace of self-pity.
It's as if, in their vision of time and destiny, the cycle of history, the bundle of years, had just been loaded against them.
The Aztec lamentations have been handed down to us,
"Broken spears line the streets,
"We have torn our hair in grief
"0ur houses are roofless now, "our walls red with blood
"0ur inheritance, our city, is lost,
"The shields of our warriors were its defence "but they could not save it,
"0ur heritage is gone,"
A year or two after the conquest, while a new Mexico was rising on the ruins of the old,
Cortes founded a hospital for the good of his soul on the spot where Montezuma had welcomed him,
By then, the King of Spain had showered him with honours,
The poor boy from Medellin had become the most famous man in Christendom,
His talents served him well.
The gambler who gambled everything and won.
But maybe in the end it was a hollow victory.
For in achieving his dream, he had to ruin it.
It's given to few people in history single-handedly to destroy a civilisation.
(SL0W DRUMBEAT)
Trujillo, Spain.
In the early 16th century two boys grew up here, dreaming of gold and conquest,
But when they left Spain for the New World, they became deadly enemies in one of the epic dramas of history the search for El Dorado,
(TRAIN'S KLAX0N BL0WS)
This is the old route from the Pacific up to Quito in Ecuador, In the 1530s and '40s, it was travelled by adventurers and conquistadors, all hoping for riches beyond their dreams,
Even at the time, there were those among the Spanish conquerors who realised the immense historical significance of the fall of the New World.
"These are the greatest events," wrote one of them, "since the beginning of the world."
And the most cataclysmic of them took place in just a few years, 1520s, the fall of the Aztecs, and then the fall of Peru in the 1530s.
And then the story shifts here to Ecuador, as thousands of Europeans flood into the continent, seeking new lands of gold.
Among them was a Spanish captain called Francisco 0rellana,
A veteran of the Inca wars, 0rellana was to be the hero of one of the most amazing journeys of exploration,
Early in 1541, he came here to Quito,
The old northern capital of the Incas, Quito was now a Spanish frontier town, 0rellana had come to find his cousin, the new governor Gonzalo Pizarro,
Handsome and cruel, Gonzalo was in his early 30s now, the greatest warrior in the New World
But Gonzalo was a man whose greed had not been satisfied even by the gold of the Incas,
0nly four years after the fall of P eru, Pizarro was dreaming of hew conquests,
From the rooftops of his palace in Quito, he could see the Andes rising to the east,
Early in 1541, a rumour began to sweep the city that beyond the mountains there lay a land richer than Mexico or even Peru,
A land of gold
The ruler of this land was said to be so rich that he covered himself in gold dust every, day and washed it off each evening,
He was the golden man of El Dorado,
"I was fascinated," said P izarro,
"And I determined to discover that land and to conquer it, "
And we set out to follow him,
We took an expedition doctor with us, John Colley,
Above 10,000 feet, you get altitude sickness potentially, so where are we at now?
Yeah, we're coming up to 12,000 feet here.
All through these campaigns, they had to operate at high altitude.
They developed this kind of cotton, thick, quilted cotton armour to fight in the tropics.
But, of course, you're dead on the equator here, but you come to this altitude and you're in serious trouble.
Beyond the peaks, they entered a drenched green world, with streams and waterfalls, which eventually become the Amazon,
They might as well have been wanderers on the surface of an alien planet,
Pizarro's route has never been traced on the ground
We know that for the first few months, he explored in a vast circle eastwards, But when his cousin 0rellana joined him, they set off from their camp near Baeza northwards to the River Coca,
(MAN WHISTLES)
(MAN CALLS 0UT) - 0K?
- Yeah.
0h, Jesus Christ.
(GR0ANS)
How many people did Pizarro bring down here?
It's quite slippery here.
Be careful.
(WHISTLING)
Are the horses with us?
- (MAN CALLS 0UT)
- Yeah, good.
- How many people did he have with him?
- 220 conquistadors.
4,000 native bearers.
200 horses, hundreds of hunting dogs.
Hundreds of llamas to carry gear.
Incredible.
To Pizarro's alarm, his vast army of native bearers was rapidly wasting away,
The Spanish had 4,000 native bearers with them from the highlands, but they all died by the time they reached the plains.
The history books say they were highland people who came down here and couldn't cope, but why should 4,000 have died, do you think?
Was it malaria?
Not malaria.
That was something the Spanish brought over with them.
0f course, there were all these other infectious diseases like measles and smallpox and so forth.
But these big waves of epidemics would have been through already, before this expedition set off, so I wonder if there was something else.
We should ask Delphine.
He's the expert.
Starvation, I think.
Delphine.
(SPEAKS SPANISH) 0ur guide Delphine was a man who knows how to survive in the forest,
(B0TH SPEAK SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) I don't think it's possible to find that much food for that many people, because you can't always rely on the jungle to provide you with food or fruit.
I think it would be impossible to feed them.
Starvation.
You can imagine trying to find food in this area for that huge number of people.
So the 4,000 Indians basically were starved to death.
I presume they'd be the bottom of the feeding chain as well.
And basically left to fend for themselves as things got really tough.
"The terrain was terrible," said P izarro,
"We had to hack our own path through,
"And we were worn out already from the crossing of the Andes, "
Frustrated and angry Pizarro took it out on his native guides, torturing them, burning them alive and feeding them to his dogs, Not a man to argue with,
Food was a growing problem, even for the Spaniards,
"In the end, " says Pizarro, "we were forced to eat the buds of a plant like a vine stalk, "
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
0nly the little curly bud on the top.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
That was before they started eating their precious horses,
At last we reached the first landmark described by the Spanish,
Hidden behind the falls, legend says, was the gold of the Inca Atahualpa,
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) Those who are in touch with nature believe that the spirits exists here.
(SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) Yes, this is a door to the spiritual world.
The real story of what's behind the falls, not that it's gold as the Spanish believed, but behind there is the entry to the world of the spirits.
Isn't it wonderful?
Everything the Spanish understand literally that the Indians actually mean metaphorically.
"And so we pushed on through thick forest," Pizarro says,
"hacking with axes and machetes,"
"0ften it was impossible to get our horses through, "
See what an effort it is just to hack a path through virgin forest.
You're lucky if you do a mile or two each day.
Can you imagine what this was like for hundreds of people and all their baggage and their animals trying to get their way through this?
It just doesn't bear thinking about.
At last, after six months in the jungle, they emerged from the Andes foothills and saw this view, an immense flat horizon,
Even with their limited knowledge, they must have known this stretched all the way to the Atlantic, But how far was that and what lay in between?
(MICHAEL) The big stones.
There's a branch under there.
They marched on down the Coca,
"There were many days," says Pizarro,
"when we were wading knee-deep, waist-deep or even worse, "
It's deep.
And still no sign of El Dorado,
By now, seven months in, the army was demoralised Many were too sick to move,
Though he hid it from his men, Pizarro was desperate,
0rellana now tried to persuade him to turn back, but Pizarro wouldn 't give up his quest,
He ordered his men to build a boat to carry, the sick and wounded and the heavy gear,
It took his starving troops a month to make, smelting their horseshoes to forge the nails,
But there was an easier way, Using renewable balsa wood, we made a traditional raft with hardwood nails and ropes oo bark,
With this, we hoped to follow Pizarro down the Coca to the River Napo,
It just goes to show.
The Spanish went to all that trouble about getting nails and you only need some hard wood and some soft wood and you can do it without metal.
We'll see if it works.
(SH0UTING)
It's our brigantine.
I don't think we'll do the full 3,000 miles on that, though.
I don't mind.
Pizarro's army set off again on the 9th of November, 1541, 0f the beauties of the landscape around them, there's no mention in his account,
This is what you never read in the history books.
You never feel the sense of this immense forest, stretching for 2,000 or more miles.
This immense blue sky and this great river.
Even with the boat, progress was painfully slow,
They could still only go as fast as the army, trudging along the bank,
(THUNDER)
They marched on for 43 days, Christmas came,
By now some of the Spaniards were dying of starvation,
Their Christmas was made even more miserable by the news that a vast uninhabited region lay ahead, where no food was to be found
It was Pizarro's nightmare,
Mutiny was in the air, And then 0rellana stepped forward
That Christmas, in their camp here by the river, the whole expedition deeply depressed by the struggle of the last ten months,
0rellana came up to Pizarro and said, "Look, give me the brigantine, give me the boat,
"and a few canoes, some of the men and I'll go downstream
"to try and find some food and I'll come back in three or four days."
Pizarro looked at him and said, "Whatever you think's best."
0rellana left next day with 57 men,
But within days, so he said later, he realised the current was too strong and he couldn 't go back,
"So we chose what seemed to us the lesser of two evils, " 0rellana said,
"trusting to God we'd go on and follow the river
"and either die or see what marvels lay ahead"
What he didn 't know was that ahead of him was the greatest river on earth,
The first few days they passed through an empty landscape, chewing their boots to stay alive, so close to death, they were hallucinating,
Then, on Monday evening, the 8th of January they heard drums, 0rellana landed and nervously went into the forest,
They were the first Europeans to walk in the interior of A mazonia, - Do you think they might be asleep?
- I don't think there's anybody home right now.
They've got their boots right here.
But they're obviously...
It's closed up.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
There's nobody here.
Well, they did run away when 0rellana first landed.
Left their cooking pots and their food.
0rellana's men were starving, so, of course, they stuffed themselves.
The Indians were very nice about it when they came back.
The man's name was Tapui, Nelson Tapui,
He farmed here with his family, pretty much cut off from the outside world
(SPEAK SPANISH)
He spoke Quechua, the Inca language,
(SPEAKS QUECHUAN)
0h, he'll have to talk slower than that.
And language would be the key to 0rellana's survival,
(SPEAKS QUECHUAN)
He began to put words down in a notebook,
What's the name in Quechuan?
- Lomo.
- Lomo.
So yoca is lomo.
That's very...
"The captain made a point to get to understand the native languages, " says the diary,
And he made his own primer to help him, So if you ask for good water to drink, to drink.
(SPEAKS QUECHUAN)
Nelson sent his son up a tree to bring seed pods for us to eat,
The native people here were called Imara, They gave 0rellana food, too,
They let the Spaniards stay with them for a month to recover their health,
Saved them from death,
(THEY SPEAK QUECHUAN)
Can I open?
0K.
I could get into these.
Delicious.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
At this moment, 0rellana was still thinking like a conquistador, He told his hosts that he was claiming them and their land for the King of Spain,
Bye-bye.
But maybe a change was beginning to take place in his mind, for kind treatment of the Indians, he said now, was the right way to follow,
0ver the coming months, 0rellana would make contact with many different Indian peoples,
Some, like Nelson, would feed and shelter him,
Some would try, to kill him,
The mum gives us a smile.
She thought we were aliens at first.
Back upriver, Pizarro was waiting for 0rellana to return, his men now dying around him,
And as the days turned to weeks, he began to suspect that his loyal cousin might have betrayed him,
0rellana's encounter with the Imara had offered hope of survival,
Now he and his men decided to get their story, straight,
They appointed a scribe to put down on paper why they'd deserted P izarro,
And each and every, one of them put his name to it,
"We've travelled 200 leagues through savage jungle," they said.
"We've all seen it with our own eyes.
"We've felt constant fear of losing our lives because of suffering and hunger.
"How much more danger and death would there be were we to turn back now?
"Therefore we all beg you," they say to 0rellana, "not to ask us to do this.
"And we ask our scribe to write it down.
"And we are all willing to follow you by any other route to save our lives.
"But not to turn back."
But was 0rellana being quite truthful?
0r did he hope to claim the secret of El Dorado for himself
We continued on his track, down the Coca to its junction with the Napo,
Not so long ago, this was just a mission station, Now the town of Francisco 0rellana is a Wild West place which has boomed with the opening up of the forest to the new conquistadors, the loggers and the oil men,
Just looking round ourselves and seeing the open sewers and dogs running wild and the terrible overcrowding and you suddenly understand why it was that diseases evolved in cities, where there are huge concentrations of people, rather than in the far healthier lifestyle of the jungle.
And this is, I suppose, the second conquisto, isn't it, you know.
First they came looking for gold and El Dorado and now the forests are being plundered.
They've had their rubber and now it's the hardwoods and it's black gold - oil.
- Adios, amigo. - Yeah, bye-bye.
When you get to Manaus, remember, if you go swimming, don't have a pee.
And so we said our goodbyes to Dr Colley, 0h, dear.
0ur next leg would take us down the Napo, the conquistadors' river of cinnamon,
Here's to the River Napo.
0rellana sailed on past other great rivers, the Aguarico, the Curaray, down into what is now Peru,
"We made good speed," says the diary,
"Sometimes more than 20 leagues a day, for the river's flow was swift and strong, "
0rellana was now on one of the main tributaries of the Amazon, heading east through a vast fluid wilderness,
From the air, it's a bewildering maze,
0ut here nature seems to have no bounds,
0rellana and his men must have gazed on the scene, part in wonder, part in terror,
A few days later, they came to a gigantic confluence, the Napo and the Maranon, the beginning of the Amazon proper,
And as 0rellana reached the Maranon, far to the west, Pizarro had finally given up hope of seeing him again and ordered his men to turn back,
There's a shift now in the tone of the expedition diary, kept by the priest, Father Carvajal,
It may be hindsight, but he seems aware now that the journey was turning into an epic of exploration,
"It seemed to us, by our continuing survival,
"that our Lord Jesus was pleased with such a great venture into the unknown,
"For such a feat of discovery, surely might not otherwise have taken place
"for many centuries into the future,"
Ah.
Muchas gracias.
- (W0MEN SING) - 0K.
- Bienvenido a 0rellana.
- Muchas gracias.
Buenas noches.
It was here that 0rellana first heard strange stories of a fierce tribe of female warriors, like the Amazons of Greek myth,
(RHYTHMIC F0LK S0NG)
His contemporaries never believed him, but he always swore the tale was true,
It's a myth which crops up in many places and maybe it's not just a myth,
The Spanish say that when they came down the Amazon, there were all these tribes that were ruled by women and only when they wanted children did they go and raid and get the men and have sex with them and get pregnant
and then they'd boot the men out.
Are there still...
Can you still find women like this on the Amazon?
(W0MAN TRANSLATES)
(TRANSLAT0R) Ah, dominant.
Yes, there are woman who are dominant.
0f course.
Yes, there are women who have power over the men.
(W0MAN SINGS NATIVE FOLKBALLAD)
No one knows for sure whether the Amazons really existed
But they gave the river the name it still has today, Rio Amazonas, the river of the Amazons,
(W0MAN SINGS FOLKBALLAD)
All the way through what is now Peru, the local people treated these strangers from another world kindly,
But did 0rellana ever see them as fully human like himself
I think he remained a conquistador,
Nonetheless, he was still carefully recording words from the river languages,
(W0MAN SPEAKS L0CAL DIALECT)
"Next to God, " says the diary "the captain's understanding of the native languages
"was the deciding factor in saving us all from death, "
(THEY SPEAK L0CAL DIALECT)
0rellana's diary, is the first description of the peoples of A mazonia,
"This part of the river, " he says, "they were part of a great federation, the Aparians, "
In the two centuries after the coming of the Spanish, 90% of the population here died from violence and disease,
Today the survivors are people living after a holocaust,
It was a tragedy which went almost unrecorded
Here in Iquitos, Father Joaquin is trying to set the record straight, to recover the lost history, of A mazonia,
(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)
In the 16th century these were big towns, large and well-organised communities,
So maybe what you see now is a distant reminder of what 0rellana saw,
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
(TRANSLAT0R) I had studied the case of 0rellana for a long time and I concluded that 0rellana met a huge diversity of peoples here.
We wondered what happened to all these people.
We reckon there were over six million in the whole of Amazonia.
(MICHAEL) The Spaniards were amazed by the natural produce of the forest and the river, the huge quantities of fish of every, kind, parrots, turtles as large as leather shields,
(SPANISH)
In his library Father Joaquin has a copy of the original diary,
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
This is the hand...
This is the handwriting of Carvajal.
(TRANSLAT0R) "This account was written by Friar Gaspar de Carvajal, "a friar of the order of Dominicans,
"of the voyage of discovery down the great and famous river."
The famous great river.
(READS IN SPANISH)
"And I was an eyewitness to these amazing things, " says Carvajal,
"A man whom God chose to play a part in such a strange
"and hitherto never experienced voyage of discovery, "
This is the next stage of our Amazonian journey, the Natalia Carolina.
It says, "Heading for Cubagua today, six o'clock.
"Por mi madre sin falta." "0n my mother without fail."
Well, it's about half past six.
Well...
This is Amazon time.
0rellana stayed with the Aparians for two months to build a second, bigger boat, a 30-footer,
A boat strong enough for the sea,
When he left in late April, he still had 2,000 miles of river to go,
(W0MAN SINGS)
The dream of El Dorado is distant now, And for me the voyage had begun to gather like static the history, of the intervening 500 years, The later conquistadors, like the demented Aguirre, the so-called Wrath of God
The missionaries, the prospectors and the debt raiders, they all came this way,
And the clamour of history, rose like the sound of the forest in the night,
And in the ghostly shapes we passed, it was easy to imagine the Spaniards on their fragile craft,
"What hardships, what suffering and what extraordinary, dangers we passed through, "
wrote Friar Carvajal, He lost an eye in one attack,
"The people are more hostile now,"
And as for 0rellana, too kind-hearted a soul by far, some said He had learned to read the signs and to negotiate fear, Most of all, perhaps, in himself
They now began to see canoes everywhere, They were approaching even richer lands,
By the middle point of the river, they came past huge settlements, extending for many miles, without any gaps between the clusters of houses.
These were large, well-organised communities, with thousands of people, real high cultures.
They were now inside the territory, of a huge native federation, which stretched for hundreds of miles along the river, the 0magua, They passed so many towns that they could only remember them by giving jokey tags to people and places,
Main Street, Chinatown, Viciousville and Stupidville,
So 0rellana's diary, offers a new history, for Amazonia, an elaborate series of ancient kingdoms, networks and alliances, which had developed over thousands of years, united by the river itself
After three days' sailing, we reached the Brazilian frontier,
0rellana had to pass a border here, too - the frontier of the Machiparo state,
He had to fight his way through,
It's so relaxed today I couldn 't find anyone to stamp my passport,
Immigration?
Immigration?
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Thanks.
Gracias.
But the spectre of Gonzalo Pizarro still haunted 0rellana and his men,
0rellana never forgot the potential cost of crossing Gonzalo Pizarro, a member of the most powerful family in the Americas.
Desertion, after all, was punishable by death.
And their boyhood friendship would count for very little.
So he and his men, all through the journey, covered themselves.
This is the second main document they drew up, formally petitioning 0rellana to be their leader, and every single member of the expedition has signed it, with loud protestations of loyalty to the governor, Gonzalo Pizarro.
But, at this moment, they had no idea whether Pizarro was alive or dead.
Pizarro, though, was a man who could face death without flinching,
The tale of his hellish return has inspired movies, plays and books ever since,
"For suffering, famine and misery " wrote one conquistador,
"this was the worst journey ever in the Indies,"
Attacked all the way, Pizarro didn 't know where he was or what direction to take to reach Peru, or any place Christians might be,
"We ate all our dogs and horses," he wrote,
"and we got back with only our swords and the rotten rags we stood up in, "
Plzarro's only thought now was revenge against his boyhood chum, the worst liar that ever there was,
And 0rellana sailed on, as amazing spectacles of nature came one after the other,
In early June, 0rellana arrived at the site of Manaus, where the river stretches to the horizon, as wide as an inland sea,
Manaus was built in the centre of the rainforest, Founded as a Jesuit mission in the 18th century when the opening up of A mazonia really started
Where the opera house and the grand mansions now stand, 0rellana saw huge settlements of hative people lining the waterfront,
There are few places where you feel more strongly the all-consuming march of history,
Looking centuries into the future, 0rellana's diary, says this -
"It was our desire that, if possible, the land and its barbaric people
"should not have negative feelings about our first encounter,
"So that one day the country, might be tamed for pacification
"and reduced to obedience to our Christian civilisation, "
The western conception of a city was a new innovation in the Americas which came with the conquest.
They require a new way of life, new laws and customs and institutions to make a new identity, to reshape humanity, if you like.
They also suck in the products of the natural world, of the forest and the river, and consume them.
And in that, cities like this, Manaus, represent a break in that continuum of thousands of years of life here in the Americas.
There may have been five million indigenous people here, when 0rellana came through.
The present population of the natives of Amazonia is 250,000, less than a quarter of this city.
That's the scale of the revolution.
At last, after eight months on the river and against all the odds, in August, 1542, 0rellana reached the mouth of the Amazon,
They had sailed 2,500 miles down the greatest river on earth, They had seen unknown empires and encountered lost worlds,
"It had been less of a journey," said one of them, "more of a miracle,"
But even as their makeshift boats carried the 47 survivors to safety in the Caribbean, back in Quito, Gonzalo Pizarro was petitioning the King for revenge,
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Pizarro accused 0rellana of treason, a crime punishable by death,
"Captain 0rellana paid no heed to the duty that he owed Your Majesty,
"and to the wellbeing of the army and the whole expedition.
"Instead of bringing us back food, he displayed to us all the greatest cruelty
"that ever faithless men have shown.
"And he's the worst traitor that ever lived."
In his defence, 0rellana used the documents that they'd drawn up on the river.
"Pizarro wasn't telling the truth.
What happened was his responsibility.
"The fact was we couldn't get back to him.
"And, in the end, it was God's will that we went on to make such amazing discoveries."
Pizarro never came home,
He died fighting the Crown for his family's empire in Peru,
His house is still there, the garden where he and Gonzalo crossed toy swords as boys,
He married a wealthy young wife, Anna, but he couldn 't settle back in Spain,
He petitioned the King to send him back to HIS river, with the title of Governor of the Amazon,
But his luck ran out, The expedition was a disaster,
This is how Anna remembered 0rellana's death.
"My husband couldn't find the main channel of the river
"and, for 11 months, we wandered around like lost people.
"And in that time, we suffered such hardships,
"because of hunger, disease and incessant rainfall.
"We ate all the horses and the dogs
"and, in the end, almost all the expedition died.
"My husband among them."

The easiest way to understand it is referring to the heatwave of 2003 we have well known, may be more in the countryside with agricultural production.
In 2003 this is my place that's what grew and I did not harvested.
When we see this as a farmer one has the right to wonder about the future.
That's why I brought you wood that I will distribute.
Touching wood, I think it's good
It makes you feel calm.
It's nice and it smells good.
Here's a piece for each of you, if you want to distribute.
It's cherry and plum.
There are probably few in Paris.
Pass it to the others and we will do a simple experiment
to show that these branches are the future of agriculture.
It seems crazy !
We hear of Agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the brink and we are on the brink.
I'll show you the same experience as I had.
You take the branch and you do like that.
It can be shaped like a circle very easily.
And what I experienced in 2003, in 2004 I did not experienced.
Because the flexibility of these small branches that are produced every year growing every day the forest makes them.
The best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans.
Agriculture has derived to the assistantship, to technology.
Farmers who don't understand ground anymore.
Farmers have forgotten that the best model and pragmatism of life encourage us to watch the living.
From the living, the forest is the best example.
No human intervention no watering, no fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides it works alone.
When I discovered the flexibility of the small branch I wondered :
why the branches of large diameter break easily ?
Whereas we can shape small branches as a circle that represent the virtuous circle of trees which produces branches in huge quantities.
I found on the internet an explanation of the forest and its soil.
We learn that leaves are attached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall.
They restore 50 to 60% of their content to the branches.
In this branch you are holding,
there all the nutrients which allow buds in a few months to make new branches which contain branches for the following year.
Trees restart their growth only with the content of the small branches.
On large diameter branches there are no such nutrients.
As you read this, you think you can already act individually and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches.
The more we are numerous and the more is the occasion to meet, to live well then we cut the branches, we gather them we make pile and grind it in a machine.
This is a technical operation, but not insurmountable.
In Africa, we do it with a machete.
We spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm, no more.
We realize that this is not prohibitive for a garden with this material which is hidden here.
I will open it later.
When it is placed on the ground in winter, spring we incorporate it.
You mean there is something about seasons?
Yes, indeed.
At the arrival of winter, the branches store nutrients.
It's going nowhere but in the branches, only at that time.
In the spring, those elements are diffused again.
So we proceed to what is called incorporation.
After a few weeks the agricultural soil that was here mainly stones has become this.
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer.
Here is the top and there underneath.
We see mycelium, the real mushroom.
The mycelium is our collaborator to do what nature does only with mushrooms food chain with the lignin molecule.
The lignin molecule is very energetic and here comes a complex food chain of the soil.
The cultivated agricultural land becomes a forest soil.
It is a copy / paste of forest soil / agricultural land.
It works surprisingly for this stony soil with the RCW to grow wheat
with yields almost higher than normal.
The surprise is enormous, because the trees grow too as well as vegetables.
There you are on limestone plateaus of Quercy I invite you to my place.
I brought you bracnches from my place, but here it is.
Zucchini grow in full sun.
No watering, just seedlings.
I plant the seeds in the ground and wait for it to grow.
This year, with 12 zucchinis, I picked up 190 kilos.
No watering, no phytosanitary treatment, no weed control.
It might looks like the Garden of Eden we put the seeds in the ground and harvest.
These are my productions.
Unfeasible on the plateau.
When you say you are going to grow carrots on limestone plateaus everyone says it, agronomists, experts there are 30 to 40% of stones,
30 cm of soil, impossible.
No water, no fertilizer, no treatment.
Yields are 160 to 170 %.
The amount of dry matter is 30% extra.
Which means that the plants have less water and are tastier they overcook less easily and preservation is much longer.
No evidence of disease, plague, aphids or pests
It seems magical.
No human intervention.
It is like facing the forest without human intervention.
Is it still agriculture ?
Is this a new concept?
Even in Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, gestures are the same, the results are the same.
When small branches are grinded, we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenomenon.
Mushrooms of a certain family will take nutrients triggers a food chain which induces life returning in soil.
I have not mentioned the name, but it is RCW
W for Wood
R for Ramial, branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree bearing leaves, where photosynthesis happens.
Energy from the sun, transformed by the leaves is stored in the branches
This concept bothers agronomy, the farming profession must be reinvented.
You imagine a farm with 20 to 30% of forest area or wood.
It can occur without soil conditioner with 50% less water at least and a yield of 160 to 170%.
You do it every 4-5 years.
It is about sustainability
This concept affects many people but research has difficulties to take it in account.
This package, for those who want, we can share it because it works in the garden, in a flower pot, with a lemon tree or a plant that you like.
You put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
You will have the most beautiful fruits less watering needs and besides it's beautiful, it smells good.
For those that want to smell and take some there is a characteristic smell of forest.
I invite you to share this meal with the ground.
Note:
C of RCW stands for Chipped

This is a rocket stove.
Rocket stoves generally create much more efficient combustion and are better able to store heat than conventionnal stoves.
And so, I decided I wanted to build this stove rather than use the previous one that I had because I wanted to be putting less pollution into the atmosphere but also this stove, you actually feed wood into the top
which means that you can put long pieces of wood, directly into the stove and it doesn't have to be cut to be able to burn.
So, I can put the wood in here and the burning actually happens down in the bottom of this area and then, the flue gas will travel through the stove there is a riser up inside the barrel itself
that creates a draft so that you can actually have the wood feeding in through the top and then the flue gas will travel up, hit the top of the barel on the inside and then there is an opening on the outside.
On the inside of the barrel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle.
All the flue gas will travel down around the outside of the barrel and out through the back and up, out of the chimney.
All this cob here that surrounds the stove is designed to capture the heat from the combustion so that it's not just all going straight up the chimney.
With a conventionnal stove the heat tends to travel out of the building very quickly.
This allows for more of the heat to be stored in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the cob.
So, this is the sky house rocket stove
It is a sort of a wall in between our dinning room and our living room.
Basically, you got the intake here the barrel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of cob surrounding most of the barrel here.
This entire wall is actually a cob wall.
Basically we got a lot more mass to store heat in we've got a little bit of area where the barrel is exposed so that is gonna through heat in the room quickly when you first light the stove but for the most part we are looking at the stove
to store heat for a long time and we burn the fire here in the morning, we can run it for a few hours and all of this cob will still be warm into the evening.
So, here we are on the other side of the wall, in the dining room.
Here is the other side of the barrel encased in cob and then the flue of the rocket stove runs all the way through this bench and up that chimney.
One of the benefit of the rocket stove is that you can have a long horizontal run of your flue pipe and you can monitor a bench or under a bed or wherever you want to store that heat.
Normally we have a table here so this one of the seat of the table, that is very popular when we are in winter cause this area gonna stay warm pretty much all day until the evening if we fire the rocket stove that day.
There is about 4 to 6 inches of cob on top of the flue here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it heats up.
I would say 2 or 3 hours but then it wil stay warm throughout the day.
The front of the rocket stove there is only about 2 inches between the flue and the front and that heats up a little faster sometimes it is almost a little too hot so that 4 inches is really great if it's going
to be an area, where you are physically in contact with.
Like this bench.
We oil the bench to waterproof it cause it is near the table.
The chimney runs up as cob all the way up into the second story and that, again stores thermal mass up into the bedrooms, upstairs as well.

welcome to Basalt Mountain located on the northern rim of the Roaring Fork valley in Colorado.
The climate here is hot and dry in the summer and frigid in the winter.
To the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here.
until now no one would have considered farming in this dry rocky nutrient poor soil.
But thanks to our current understanding of nature's natural processes one man has built up a nutrient rich soil upon this dry undesirable clay forming the foundation for a thriving ecosystem
Jerome Osentowski is the man behind the ecosystem and the Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute.
nestled on the side of Basalt Mountain lye one acre of edible forest garden guilds and four passive and active solar greenhouses which have become a large part of Jerome's most recent Permaculture endeavors
I came to Colorado in 1969 and I spent about the first seven or eight, ten years As a ski instructor.
and gradually got interested in healthy foods
Through having somewhat of a health crisis with hyperglycemia so I decided to look into wild foods and that lead me into growing my own gardens and using wild foods when it was available
Jerome began gardening in the lowlands of the Basalt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on Basalt Mountain due to the arid soils and difficulty in harnessing water but once I learned about permaculture
I found that it was totally possible to create these beautiful gardens using recycled materials, and building compost, sheet mulching, using perennial and annual vegetables
In combinations of designs
So, we started annual gardening here for ten years or so and then we gradually segued into perennial polycultures outside and now inside and we've taught hundreds of people here through internship programs and through the different design courses and workshops here.
what's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combination of plants in our forest gardens and see how we build our greenhouse
But Jerome's success in Permaculture hasn't come without some major road blocks
In 2008 a devastating fire burned down one of his first tropical greenhouse's Ironically named Pele [after the Hawaiian fire goddess] to the ground.
the fire in Pele was actually a blessing in disguise.
because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger, better greenhouse.
So I worked with Michael Thomson my partner in Ecosystems Design to redesign the new greenhouse.
At the time that Pele burned down Jerome had been working with well know local architect Michael Thompson on advancing greenhouse design by introducing what Jerome called "Climate Battery Technology"
The destruction of Pele gave the two the chance to put their latest research to the test and in the spirit on new beginnings the new greenhouse would be named Phoenix after the mythological bird that burns itself and rises from the ashes to live through another cycle.
Hi I'm Michael Thompson,
I'm chief architect with ecosystems design in Basalt Colorado and partner with Jerome Osentowski.
The climate battery as we now call it, is a series of tubing in which air is taken in at the high point of the greenhouse, pumped through tubing, and exhausted at the south end of the greenhouse.
and then that air circulates over and over again picking up heat and then delivering it underground and storing it.
So at ecosystems design, we create designs for greenhouses and passive solar buildings and homes as well as outdoor landscaping perennials and annuals for organic agriculture in the rocky mountain region.
in addition to designing indoor and outdoor Permaculture and edible landscapes
We create the buildings that allow that indoor growing, such as this one in Steamboat Springs.
This is a large thirty six by eighty foot greenhouse that will support sub-tropical and anything below that.
and here we have inside the greenhouse, all of these planting beds that we have created above ground and under ground we have these forced air heat storage systems
So all of these fans are delivering air through these vertical risers which then underground distribute the warm air through these horizontal manifolds through these perforated tubes that deliver the heat and the moisture from that air into the soil for use later in the cold nights.
So as a result we get these indoor environments that are very well insulated and heated against winter conditions such as this last year.
and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experiencing is uhh...
This is when we began the planting of this greenhouse last autumn, and this spring we had this much growth in there.
So we have flowers, we have other plants that support the insect populations for beneficial controls and for pollination, and we have all of the soil conditions and the climate conditions to grow tropical Banana plants, and Guavas and Figs and Papaya etcetera.
and these greenhouses also function very well as early propagation centers
Where we can start the plants in February that will grow outdoors as annuals.
We also have climate control equipment like these curtains that draw across underneath the glazing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insulating layer for accomplishing that.
So we also do solar homes solar energy productive buildings.
in addition to designing greenhouses for private investors CRMPI and growing spaces are building growing domes for local schools in colorado in order to raise awareness about the importance of a local food economy.
the institute has currently built a growing dome at Yampa Mountain High School in Glenwood Springs and the Roaring Fork High School in Carbondale both facilities will be utilized as classrooms for sustainable agriculture curriculums and the food produced will be integrated into the school lunches. there you can find out more about our services and browse our design galleries.
for more information about the Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute and how you can contribute please visit CRMPI.ORG there you'll find detailed information about our growing dome projects via the community food initiative as well as workshop dates and internship availability.
and built the Geodesic Growing Domes used at the local high schools and special thanks to John Cruickshank for his role in the technological advancements of what is now called the Climate Battery

Water
Water is
Water is life.
Bassin de rétention d'eau à Tamera (Portugal)
avec Sepp Holzer et Benrd Müller
Water is life.
Water is the most important thing.
The whole world is 70% water.
We, animals, everything-70% water.
Water is the key issue for the survival human kind on this planet.
Nature has provided enough water everywhere on earth;
but, a billion people do not have sufficient access to clean drinking water.
More and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need.
Centralized systems of artificial water management cannot solve this problem.
We need de-centralized systems of natural water management.
We are in Tamera Peace Research Center in southern Portugal, where a water retention landscape has been in development since summer 2007.
Bernd Muller is responsible for Tamera's ecological research work.
In 2007 the community of Tamera still had the question whether a site of this size threatened by desertification could provide food, water and energy for 300 people.
We visited Sepp Holzer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water landscape.
Sepp Holzer, an Austrian mountain farmer, is a well-known specialist and visionary for permaculture and landscape healing.
Water is always at the core of his work.
For me water is the most important capital.
Wherever it's possible, you should create retention spaces and collect the rain water and re-learn with the water how to maintain a balance.
This is the most important thing because once you've created the right hydrological balance,
70% of the work is done.
ou help rich vegetation to develop, diversity ecause nature can reveal itself and develop in the right way.
Traveling through the world I have not seen a single situation, nation or land in which the development of a water retention landscape would not give the first important healing impulses.
In many parts of the world, countries are not able to feed their population anymore. They have been unable to maintain their natural wildlife for a long time.
As a consultant in many countries
Sepp Holzer sees the consequence of deforestation, monoculture, overgrazing and industrial agriculture.
All these factors destroy the natural water balance.
The soil is drying out. Water is being lost and the retention space, the natural water storage system of the earth, is becoming dry and the flora and fauna disappear.
In the end the land will turn into desert or burn ecause it's so dry.
You can see these problems happening all over the world, bringing huge catastrophes.
And the heavy rains come anyway.
What happens then?
The water rushes down the slopes because the dry soil does not absorb the water.
When the soil is hotter than the falling rain it rejects the water.
Only when the soil is cooler, when the vegetation is giving shadow then it attracts the water and lets it seep in.
This is the construction site for a new water retention space in Tamera.
Wherever you work with soil you can read the signs of erosion.
Topsoil should actually form a thick, living layer everywhere on the ground which enables rainwater to filter in.
But, this layer has been eroded away.
Now the topsoil lies in layers many meters thick in the bottom of valleys or is found as mud in rivers.
The surface of fields and sites higher up is depleted and barren.
De-centralized water retention landscapes give the water time to filter back into the earth body.
People always have the same questions, always the same worries, where will all this water come from ?
in such dusty dry soil without streams or a river.
How can I build a lake here ?
People have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the catchment area and the rain, the blessing of the water in the right way.
When I use the catchment area, thereupon, the lake will fill very quickly.
How much water can change a landscape in a short time.
We can see here, comparing Tamera before the creation of Lake 1 and today.
Water retention landscapes can be built everywhere.
Anywhere on earth.
A water retention space must not be sealed with concrete or plastic.
It is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the narrowest point of a valley.
You dig a ditch until you reach an impermeable layer.
On that solid ground you apply layer after layer of fine material, like moist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water barrier.
This water barrier is the core of the dam.
For the outside of the dam I take course material, it doesn't have to be dense and water-proof. Of course,
I will also have to compact it by driving on it and rolling it.
And like this, I build the whole dam, the water barrier in the core nd on the outside in a slope of 1 to 2, 1 meter up and 2 meters along, like this I build the two layers together, up to the top.
The water retention spaces have winding banks, shallow and deep zones, a diverse vegetation of water plants and are built aligned to the prevailing wind direction this way the water is always moving, is enriched with oxygen,
The water in a water retention landscape stays fresh and alive by itself.
Since we created the first retention space, we can already keep much of the water from the winter rainfalls on the land.
In this way in can unfold its full healing capacity, the wildlife is responding and is returning and the vegetation is recovering.
We can plant fruit trees again, the forests recover and we can grow our food for people and for animals in the direct surroundings of the first retention space.
The water which used to run away and which is now stored here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole groundwater system.
In the first year, a spring developed below this lake which now gives water throughout the year.
Since we built this first dam, we no longer have such big variations with a lot of flowing water in winter when it's raining and droughts in the summer.
We have a more constant water situation throughout the year, which is of course a huge benefit for nature.
Nature shows you how this works, you just have to ask her, have to contact her, to communicate with her, then you will be fine anywhere on earth.
Ask nature, think with her and not against her.
Put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need.
Make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen.
A forest garden is a three dimensional garden of useful plants.
So there's trees, shrubs, ground cover plants, perennial plants all designed to maximise beneficial interactions and minimize competition, designed to be sustainable in the long term by having plants that feed other plants by having plants for bees to sustain a pollinating population,
sustainable from other ways too, because most of the plants are perennial, you know trees or smaller plants and so the soil is not dug most of the time and not digging the soil is really important in term of sustainability
because every time you dig the soil, a lot of carbon goes into the air.
This is Chinese dogwood, which is as you can see, a fantastic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edible fruit which follows later in the year.
Apart from food, there are various other things you can grow and I do in this forest garden so I include medicinal plants,
I include plants for dying, for basketry use, plants for fibers, there are of course a lot of bee plants, sometimes plants are here specifically for bees, so you might look at a particular plant in this forest garden
and I won't necessarily harvest that plant myself it might have a system function in terms of feeding another plant, or it might be here specifically for bees because if flowers are at a good time of year for bees
and so on. So there is plants for all sources of different uses.
There's ... I think forest gardens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gardens.
Of course mainstream agriculture of course is completely dependent on oil, and you know what happens to oil will have a big effect and of course the oil price will may certainly go up and up over the decades to come,
because, you know, demand will exceed supply. In this country particularly, you know, tree ... you know, farmers don't tend to know much about trees and foresters don't know much about farming and agroforestry which is kind of in the middle of the two
therefore is quite ... seems quite difficult for people and farmers to access because, you know, they are not comfortable with trees.
So that's a potential problem that could slow down, you know, the implementation of more agroforestry based systems on farming.
But I think it needs to happen and I think slowly it will happen but ...
I think it will take ... unfortunalety I think it will take a crisis or two, you know a serious crisis or two, to actually jolt the powers of be into actually you know, making it happen quicker.
This is one of my main salad leaves from the forest garden, it's the young leaf you use, this kind of leaf, not the old one, the old ones would be tough.
An interesting parallel to times which may be coming you know, when in the cold war years the soviet union did a lot of fruit breeding because they wanted to be self sufficient in fruit, you know, they didn't want to have to import fruit from a long distance,
well typically from, you know, the West.
And so they did a lot of interesting fruit breeding, this is one of the plants they bred in fact, And you know that has a parallel in that ... of course in the moment, as a country, you know, we import a lot of our food and there is no reason why we couldn't, more or less,
grow most of it here.
And of course that's got to be sensible from our sustainability and our resilience aspects, it's got to be sensible and our governments haven't got it yet.
Forest gardens are resilient because of the ... because of the diversity, really.
So, it's diversity of structure so lots of different plants at different levels but also diversity of species, so this forest garden has about 550 species in it, which is probably more than most because I am doing a lot of research and experimenting as well,
but, it's very common for forest gardens to have 200 species and, you know, the majority of which would be food plants you know which ... to ask when we're used to, you know, eating 20 types of vegetables or something,
you know if you're talking about 200 types of food plant, people, initially, might be slightly overwhelmed, but actually ...
I regard that as actually proving much more normal than relying on 20 you know I think ... if you look at if you look at our near relatives, things like orangutans they regularly eat 400 different types of leaf and fruit,
they know everyone, they recognize every one, you know they know exactly what they are picking that's no reason we couldn't do the same.
And I suspect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more resilient people as well.
Bamboos are fantastically useful plants and of course in China and Japan or other parts of Asia they use bamboo for more things that you could think of.
This one is growing about 20 cm a day at the moment, because of this warm weather so ... and you can actually hear them growing, bamboos are the only plants I can claim to have heard growing because when it's growing that fast and you put your ear near the top
you can hear the fibers unfurling and crackling away.
So, if I just cut the top of that, and cut it down in the middle, it's very interesting inside, you'll see ... you can see what are going to be the nodes which are these bits on the bamboo cane
and everything inside this white or light green is edible, so you peel of the outer leaves and then the inside bit is edible you normally steam that ... just steam it for 5 or 10 minutes and then ... because they're normally bitter raw.
This garden is now 16 years old and ... I've certainly seen I've seen climate changes in that time mainly, you know, increased average temperatures and fewer spring frosts.
Dry springs is something that most farmers hate because they've just sawed all their spring crops, or horticulturists for that matter, you know, and dry weather is just what they don't want in spring so that can be quite severe in terms of growing annual plants
so, you know, obviously if you're growing perennial plants a dry spring is, more or less irrelevant you know, won't have very much effect at all and similarly, you know, extremes of weather at other times of year are gonna have much less effect
on perennial crops than on annuals as a rule.
Fungi are probably the most important organisms of all in this forest garden, and of course most of the time we don't see it because they are under the soil surface and ... the fungi I am talking about are mycorrhizal fungi
which are beneficial fungi that form relationships with almost all plant roots.
And they do some amazing things :
when they form an association with plant roots they basically give the plant hard to get nutrients because fungi can get those out of the ground much more efficiently than plants and the plant gives the fungi some sugars in return, so it's kind of symbiosis.
But they do other things as well, they protect the plant from diseases and ... they move nutrients around in natural ecosystems and in something like a forest garden if there is more nutrients of one sort in one part of the soil
and a lack in another part of the soil, this fungi will move it, physically move it from one place to another and then the tree in another place will use it.
So that's how things like nitrogen from my nitrogen fixing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fungi move it for you.
The other thing that this fungi do, which has really just been discovered in the last few years is critical in sequestering carbon in stable states in the soil.
So without them you wouldn't get sequestration into the soil.
And of course you don't get these fungi where you dig the soil.
And this huge potential you know for sequestering more carbon into the soil you know ... and certainly you know, everybody seems to want to do that but ... but to do that, you gonna have to move to a much more perennial system.
This is pokeroot which is a quite a well known American wild edible.
Weedy shoots that come through which tend to be at the beginning of June so it's kind of very late spring crop really and the shoots come as really thick like you can see here.
You cook those and they have a sort of healthy asparagus flavor to them really, really substantial vegetable.
But poisonous when it's raw, you know, so you have to cook it but there's lots of plants you know that we eat have little poison in one state or another otherwise I think if potatoes were discovered now they probably wouldn't be allowed in this country
because you know green potatoes are quite poisonous.
I mean my estimate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden.
I use a lot of aromatic plants down in my perennial layers so a lot of different side sauce of mint for example and lemon balm or oregano, and other herbs some of which of course is harvested but,
it's doing some useful functions that's some useful functions even if you don't harvest it down this layer because you know they are rich in essential oils, mints and other aromatic plants and essential oils are anti bacterial and anti fungal so having those in the understory layers should have a protective effect you know for other plants in term of reducing bacterial diseases and fungal diseases.
The medlar is a fantastic fruit tree which a lot of people don't know but you can see the young fruits here these grow to about 3-3.5 centimeters diameter and ripen on the tree in warm summers otherwise you pick them
at the first frost and taken indoors and then they ripe in with are sort of very sweet sort of date, baked apple type flavor to them really nice edible fruit ... and also, you know, again very low maintenance it doesn't have any pests or diseases it just looks after itself.
Monoculture crops have been dominating all agriculture research for hundreds of years and even now you know mainstream agriculture scientists they don't like looking at more than one crop in one place, it makes things very complicated for them.
This is Sichuan pepper which is obviously a commercial crop grown in China mainly but it's a shrub as you can see a largely shrub and you can see it has just finished flowering it's just starting to form the peppercorns here
and each of those will form a roundish fruit so the black seed in the middle and a sort of pink shell round the outside.
It's actually that pink shell which is the spice you don't have to use black pepper if you have something like this.
Welcome to the New Afrika Shrine.
Tonight Femi Kuti is going to be playing on stage his regular Sunday jump.
All Afro-beat lovers, music lovers from around the world come here to have a ball.
And a ball they have.
You're a white man, yeah, and I'm a black man!
Africa, one love!
Shoki oh!
Femi oh!
Femi has a show at 9:00.
But, being a good musician, he's doing the right thing:
He needs to rehearse, do his voice training, play his sax, tune it before the show.
Even if you come on Monday, when we're not working, you'll still hear him playing his sax, his trumpet, maybe his keyboard... he does that all the time.
In the bathroom, he plays his trumpet!
Hey, your tickets, bros!
Your tickets!
Femi live and direct!
Brothers and sisters, welcome to a Sunday jump at New Afrika Shrine, and the last day of recording of our new album.
Anyway, say your feet come here all the way, in these times of trouble in our country, no money, no salary, no hospital, everything...
So you come all the way from Apapa, Victoria Island...
Fadeyi, Isale Awori, Ajuwon, Omole... And all over Lagos!
We're delighted that you are here with us tonight.
You say: "They talk too much for Sunday jump", we're here to make you happy, give you the good vibes you deserve.
Yesterday dem tell us say
Say today na we go gain
So we struggle suffer dey
For this new democratic change
But the truth of the matter be say
Them disguise another way
To continue their crooked ways
O yes dem bobo
Dem bobo your mama
Dem bobo your papa
Dem bobo your granmama
Dem bobo your granpapa
Dem bobo the market women
Dem bobo your journalist
The human right activist
In the name of democrazy
We have about 2000 people on Tuesdays and Thursdays at rehearsals.
And it looks like many of them feel part of this place, feel like this is their home.
They feel like my life revolves around their life, they feel like they're part of what's going on here.
I just thought that if they feel part of it, why don't I make everything open?
So that I have no secrets when I am writing a song.
Everybody's here while I do it.
I feel comfortable because of the life I'm living.
So... I know them, it's like a participation.
They're all like "What's on the next album?".
All of you vote for it.
I'm confused myself.
Tell me what you'd love to say...
Let me tell you...
Can't Buy Me and Shoki, we want them on the album!
What we can do for you is this: We can vote democratically.
Democratic elections!
Yes!
Put your pen away, and be practical.
And so we say:
I say:
"Shotan?" Yeah...
Everybody loves Shotan.
No, so we cannot do that for all 18. You'll choose.
What you can do is, you can go find your supporter's club.
Write an official letter:
"This is what I want recorded..."
"We contest your presidency!"
You know you lost, even if you go to court!
Go to court, you will see!
You can even appeal!
Yeni, can you explain what's going on?
Some of us are protesting that our numbers didn't go in the charts.
- You don't agree with the choice?
- No, not at all.
We're complaining about a special number:
Can't Buy Me.
Who dat man talking to?
Him think say him dey talk to fool
Him work his way- to come near me
Just to come disturb my peace
Him ready to dash me many thing
Him wants to buy my loyalty
But he can't buy me
Can't buy me
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey boast to me
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey yab to me
Can't buy me!
Who dat man talking to?
Him start boast of him property
Him get land here, Him get land there
Him don get land for everywhere
Him get 12 car Him get 10 house
Him wants to buy my loyalty
But he can't buy me
Na so I dey watch am
As him dey boast to me
Femi, the voice of Africa!
Ambassador of Africa!
Your Majesty!
His Excellency!
Positive Force!
Son of Fela Ransome!
African president!
Ambassador of Africa!
You're the best!
His Excellency!
Let him through!
We do not have to remind ourselves of the announcement of Shotan, also known by the name Shé wéré.
Do not throw any type of beverage, including... Chelsea, beer, Squadron, stout.
If you think I'm a squadron leader, all you have to do is go to the barracks.
Do not throw your Don Simon or Araga.
Whatever may be the drink, do not splash water on your fellow human beings, you wouldn't do it at home.
Can you throw it on your father?
You can't.
If Tinunbu came here, you would be shaking.
As I was saying, do not!
Do not throw water on him!
Obviously you are too drunk to listen to my announcement, so, let us continue...
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your heads?
Shotan, shotan, shotan
We don tell you many times before
Say na you go come to regret
So the government of Obasanjo
Go carry all of us go for hell
You carry your ponpose self about
You say you no want to hear
Now everything don scatter for your face
Senior mugo shotan o
Shotan, shotan, shotan
They enjoyed it, especially during Sunday jump.
Did you see how full it was?
Everybody was happy, enjoying themselves, and jumping and everything, which is good.
And then they relax, you know?
Because in Nigeria, life is not easy for anyone.
Cost of living, there's no lights, no water, the schools are poor...
It's not easy.
The salaries aren't paid, pensions aren't paid, so everything isn't going smoothly.
We want to have somewhere you can sit, forget everything, go there for some time. I think it's great.
Femi's doing a lot for them that way.
That's another way of getting to the people.
If he continues like that, there's no trouble.
There's no trouble in the Shrine when he's there.
Everything's cool and organized.
Whereas with Fela, it was tough.
There were always problems there.
There were always problems.
Education doesn't work, hospitals don't work properly, people are poor, police aren't paid...
I mean, no security, life is totally a mess here.
The papers tell us a different story from the reality of our lives.
A lot of people are in pain here now.
Even me, I'm comfortable, but when you see so much poverty, how can you be happy?
After 40 years of independence, there is no area in Nigeria where you have light constantly, water running constantly.
And we call ourselves independent?
Independence means you're independent of asking for favors.
We can't say we are independent, because we are still relying on many things to keep our country going.
I wanna be free from all these yeye politics
I wanna be free from all these yeye politicians
I wanna be free from all these corrupt monsters
Because of the ideals of Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, he has always found a positive way to project the black man.
We believe in Black Power, and that we can be trusted.
We want to convey that Africans can mind themselves properly.
We want to do away with the myths in black mentality that the black man can't do what he wants to achieve.
We're trying to say things can work in Africa, if our leaders do the right thing.
But most of all, if no one can do that, we should free ourselves.
I think that Femi has found a better way to project this and continue Fela's hope to project the black image right.
To try to create another way to see that things can work in black Africa.
I wanna be free from all these corrupt monsters
Wey want to chop man
The king is dead
Na dem kookuma kill the king For political reasons
Dem no fit talk as e be
Oya back to politics
Dem start to scheme For the same corruption and thief
No plan for you and me
When we dey sleep
Dey dem dey meet to plan their evil strategies
To control our resources
African leaders
And their foreign counterparts
E bi like from these evil monsters
We shall never be free
I wanna be free I said every day
Every night
I ask myself
Why, why, why
Chee because Fela die
That is why dem dey try to
Confuse I and everybody mind
Last Sunday, I had my beret.
It was stolen today.
What do they want?
- They stole my beret.
- Sanctioned.
What do you mean, sanctioned?
I told you they stole it!
Did you hear him?
I lent mine to him, over there.
They only gave me the shirt.
Isoko, anyone give you a beret?
He said he doesn't have it.
I'm wearing Michael's beret.
I had a beret, last week.
Each time we go out in this uniform we hear people yell:
"Femi's child!"
Or "the Shrine boys!"
They do recognize us as one of the "Shrine boys".
Fela, himself has already made the Shrine popular for all the Africans.
So when his son took over for him, people respect him like they respected his father.
When we put on this uniform we look as if we're close to Femi.
It's hard for people to see Femi, so when we wear this uniform, they say "this is Femi's security".
That's why we're proud to wear this uniform.
I'm proud to be working at the Shrine, I'll always be proud.
When I'm going home, a policeman will ask me:
"Where are you coming from at this hour of the night?"
I tell him I'm working security at the Shrine.
He asks if I have my ID card,
I tell him I don't have one.
This is the symbol of where I work.
As long as they can see this, they know that I work for Femi.
So they allow me to go.
If dem want to hear We go tell them plenty things
If dem want to see We go show them many things
Wey the African man Wey the African woman
Find it very difficult to succeed
Na today dem no say Mubotu no good
She na today dem no say company no good
See this African leaders
Dem don kill all their people finish
Look again Obasanjo don kill Nigerians
No not Obasanjo and his padi paddies
Dem dey try to give us different reason
To tell us say Obasanjo no guilty
Na today dem no say Charles Taylor no good
Na today dem no say Mugabe no good
My son Omorimade Afolabi Anikulapo-Kuti
See those African leaders Rolari
Dem don kill all their people finish
As we ought to know the reason why
The African man and the African woman find it difficult to su... Su...
Because you like to drink beer too much!
You like to suck breasts too much!
You'd like to be sucking pussy too much!
... Succeed!
With the dancing... with the dancing, the anger, the suffering you still find joy and peace.
We're letting so much frustration out of our system.
And all that is a language, without talking.
There is communication on that. I go to sleep,
I can wake up the next day, move forward without stress.
If my body's aching me or my girlfriend or...
Why do we need to have stress?
And I hope the people who come here have that same kind of vibe.
I mean, what is life?
To have peace of mind, know what to do the next day, how to deal with life.
So if the Shrine can do that to everybody, or anybody, I won't call it a church or mosque,
I'll just say it's life, Shrine.
I won't say God is here, God is not. God is here, but He's everywhere.
I will not go under the umbrella of religion, I'll make it spiritual. It's limitless.
I will not say:
"This is where to be", but "at least you can be".
Keyboard!
Yeah, I play the base guitar.
I dance.
He plays guitar.
I dance on stage.
I play the trumpet.
I play the shakers.
I'm a percussionist.
This is the band leader!
If I can take this country, then Africa is settled.
Once there's a good government in 1 country, they'll be liberated.
Only one straight, progressive clean government that knows what it's doing.
No diplomacy, no compromises,
and no Marxism-Leninism, no capitalism.
Africanism!
The time don come
For me to talk
Before I talk
Make I thank everyone
For the support You na give my family
During our troubles
You my friends Una dey with me Ninety-seven
I shall never forget
Ninety-seven The pain! The sorrow!
I want to thank you my friends
Jigbolo, Jijigbolo, Jigbolo!
Oh Yes I remember
The day all of us we gathered
To pay our respect to the
One and only Fela
We carry am go him house
Before him spirit go for Eledumare Palace I say
Together we walka
Carry Fela oh
For those wey no know Na that dey them know
Say the people Them love Fela oh
Together we walka
I've never seen anybody in this whole country or in all of Africa...
Only 2 people are walking the streets of power:
Nkrumah and my mother!
That's what I'm talking about!
All these dirty politicians who sit on their asses!
The young and the old The strong and the weak
The rich and the poor
Them gathered to carry Fela
Together we walka
And then as we want start to relax
We no know our problems
Just start From nowhere we hear
Cousin Fran just pass
Just like that she die
We start to wonder why
Enough is enough
The people start to talk
The problems don too much
Again as we start to relax and then suddenly we hear
Na the matter of my sister 'Sola Come make all of us weak for body
Again we ask ourselves why
For she was too young to die
As we dey cry Na so we dey try
We dey struggle to save her life
The doctors them dey lie
Them want to get money to survive
The thing wey dey pain me pass
Na the way she suffer before she died
Na so them dey cut Cut
Dey chook Chook Making Experiment with human life
Oh my sister 'Sola oh oh oh
Ninety-seven
Ninety-seven I shall never forget
Oh yes I remember
Music is the way for us. Music is the thing of the future.
Music is the weapon of the future.
Femi takes care of everybody, street boys, everybody.
We live okay here.
In Nigeria, only Femi takes care of everybody.
He's concerned about poverty, concerned about corruption, the poor...
In Nigeria he's a great man, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, and he did many songs to let people know
So we have a lot of music to let you know what is going on in Nigeria and Africa.
Femi's making people know, and wants to know more.
If you want to know more, come to the Shrine.
That's all.
He's like a prophet who has come to make people realize...
He's a prophet who makes people realize that they must fight for their rights, like one of his best tracks, Democrazy.
And now we realize that the government makes us mad, when you get mad, that's Shotan.
Shotan, it's like the destructive kid the mother didn't want to have.
That's what our government made us be.
But thank God, we have The Shrine, we have survival.
And we are ready to serve the true prophet.
- Not true?
- It's true!
We do something for ourselves!
We want to move further,
We want to go to university!
But our presidents only watch themselves, rule themselves. And the country's getting worse and worse.
Prices always go up, food, people are dying!
Food prices.
No light, no good education, no good nothing!
Mr. President, we're begging you!
We fight for our rights, man!
We're fighting together, doing something for ourselves!
For ourselves, for our lives!
Femi Kuti tells us how to think for ourselves.
Because some people are millionaires, while the country is going bad, bad!
The frustration is too much.
Sometimes when I'm walking I see the policemen beat people like dogs.
The policemen beat us like dogs.
Not true?
It's true, man!
The Afrika Shrine be my neighborhood
Every night, I'm there at Afrika Shrine
The ladies do as they like at the Shrine
Everybody does as they like at the Shrine
Every night they meet at the Afrika Shrine
Neighborhood
All Africans are my neighbors
The ladies like my neighborhood
The man we call Femi is a prophet.
We all serve him.
He's given us the message to keep the place clean.
We make sure it's clean.
We have found a survivor, we are pleased with him.
We are happy.
We are people from places like Ajegunle and Mushin, places where people go without eating.
We're here, we found survival with him.
We serve him.
That's why this place is clean.
If I leave for 5 minutes, this place will be messed up.
I must be here to make sure this place is clean.
So he'll be pleased with me, and I'll be happy he's pleased.
Bring me
Bring me the man now
I believe right now there's so much energy here.
And you can manipulate this energy for you.
My role is taking the energy of music and transforming it into dance.
If I achieve that, it's a force.
Music is a powerful force.
I take that sound, truly, not trickery or lies.
I take that energy and go pow...
And make people really go crazy.
How?
It's magic.
People ask me how I did it, I don't know.
Because I do the right thing, that energy is using me as a medium to express many things through music.
Now that energy is a constant thing, 24 hours a day.
You can use that energy to understand, for many things.
Say you have a headache, somebody will be able to just touch your head, you'll feel a kind of ease because of the true love.
You take the energy: "You have a headache? Where?"
And that person will have calm.
I beg live me
No disturb me With nonsense gist
The fine things of life These people don't see
Their bad mind No gree make dem get better dream
With their crooked legs Dem walka go redem
But salvation comes from within
Seek and ye shall find
Definitely with music
Whose rich harmonies and melodies
Will truly bring peace
All in the name of peace
We fight and kill to find justice
For me na only music
From the voice of the soul we speak
Wetin concern me with English
Na dem koko greedy dem selfish
My sisters
They bank Africa money like the Swiss
Oyinbo don kill Africa finish
Femi, don't go!
The son of Fela "Baba 70".
Don't go!
I think it's the most challenging place to compose.
If the Shrine people love it, then I'm not worried, really.
I'm not really worried, because I'm very critical of myself. If I don't like it, if I don't feel something, I will not continue the work.
After the completion of the Shrine,
I found that I was alone, and I just saw myself sinking deep into music.
And on getting where I am in life, I found that the only friend I have, the only thing I can trust, is myself.
And it's difficult to really trust yourself.
You don't want to do something, then you do it.
The only thing I have confidence in, in my life, 100%, is music.
Even if you don't give your life to music, music will take you over.
So, I just let myself go and wherever music takes me, so be it.
I have no worries concerning that.
I'm not sad.
I mean, I have peace.
Sometimes I look annoyed, it's things around me, or things people said. I am a very happy man, very happy.
Sometimes I love being alone, I love being in my own world because this world is crazy.
I don't see anything in this world that makes sense.
You prefer to be alone?
I feel safer that way.
Don't forget, I'm not alone in that respect.
I have the force of music, running like a wild fountain in my head.
That alone, I am never at peace.
And I love the feeling music gives me.
I'll never compromise that, for nothing in this world.
Nothing.
Not even myself.
I will starve myself for music.
No way, can never give it up.
Out of the way!
Calm down!
Out of the way!
May your future be bright!
Everywhere I go I see injustice
In government and our nonsense policies
Marxism, socialism, call it what you want
Capitalism all na the same oppression dey
Injustice, misuse of power na dem specialty
Pretending they want to help the human race 1, 2, 3, 4
Wetin dem dey wait for?
5, 6, 7, 8
Dem no say time no dey wait 1, 2, 3, 4
Wetin dem dey wait for?
5, 6, 7, 8,
Dem just dey waste our lives away
The Shrine is the home of all things African.
I love Femi with all my heart.
Femi is a god in Nigeria.
Before dem get power Dem make promises
When dem get power Dem start dem conspiracy
Dem dey go dey bobo us, dem go dey post us
You see now time don go, election come again
In Africa we say only the lion borns the lion.
And if a lion borns a goat... there's a problem.
So, as the lion born the lion, the lion born the lion.
Hey, pay attention, Fuckers...
You stole that Wurlitzer from my shop.
I want it back.
This isn't what it looks like.
The gay mafia are after me.
I need this cash!
I know where to find you jukebox, and the ass-clown who boosted it.
Someone wishes to buy this cursed business that haemorrhages money.
You're selling the dealership?
This place is Richard's dream, and the it's the only thing holding this family together.
Your dream lounge, the Summerwind?
You pinned all your hopes on the only emotion connection you ever had with Ken!
The song that he played for you as a baby!
Help us get out of here!
Oh God!
Aliens?
Meghan?
She is all yours now.
I am having this baby.
Baby!
I'll drive!
Oh my gosh, do something!
Come back here!
Escape the country?
What?
Good idea, Meghan.
Oh my God!
No thanks, everyone.
I'm fine.
Hello?
Hello?
A lot of stupid shit goes through your mind when you're breaking out of prison.
But when the spotlight is on you and you've got your nuts in a vise, the only thing that matters is getting the fuck out.
Escape is a state of mind.
And there's no prison that Fitzy can't break out of.
No way!
Meghan?
Fitz?
Fuck.
Where the fuck's Houdini when you need him?
Oh, for the love of fuck, it's coming!
Don't worry, Miss Devon, we will get you to the hospital safe and sound and in time to witness this beautiful, miraculous....
I need motherfucking drugs.
I got some meth, but it's prison meth.
I got hash, and Oxy Contin.
Oxy?
I could use a hit.
Get in line.
You're fucking kidding me.
Halfsies?
I'm the one in labour.
Try to hold off having the kid in the car, will ya?
It'll stain the leather and kill the re-sale value.
Whoa!
What the fuck are you doing?
Fuck, you don't have to have it in the ditch!
Oh, I'm not.
Get out!
What the hell did I do?
What haven't you done!
You're unemployed, you've never made it to any of the doctor's appointments, you're never around!
I broke out of prison!
For you!
When have you ever done anything in your life for anyone but yourself?
Okay, food for thought.
And since Richard is an escaped convict, maybe we can ponder this on the road.
Let's - Can we get a move on, please?
You shut the fuck up!
I will not let you smear your failure all over this baby.
Get out of my life, you fucking loser!
Hey!
Hey!
Fuck!
Richard!
Don't leave me here with this crazy broad!
Oh God!
Richard!
Richard, I know this is a trying time for us, but it's also an excellent opportunity to dig deep, and find out what's really going on here.
Huh?
Breathe!
Breathe!
No, really, what's going on here?
She thinks I'm a loser!
No, I doubt that's true.
Did you hear me, Fitz?
You're a fuckin' loser!
I can't have my fucking kid thinking his old man is a loser!
Let's work on this in the car!
I have to get the dealership back from those two carbomb-istanis.
Let's figure out how to pay for that in the car!
You get her to the hospital, I'll take care of the dealership.
And evade the police?
I'll call you in an hour.
Two hours.
Oh!
That's right!
Drive!
Find the closest motel!
Oh, I can handle this.
I don't need him.
I've been through worse.
I told you the kid was a loser.
He's actually a winner now, sir.
Richard has decided to make the baby proud, and buy back the dealership.
The dealership?
Yep.
Over my dead body!
You said you didn't want it.
First rule of business:
Lie.
You should be proud too, Ali, because you and the baby are having a positive effect on the Fitzpatricks.
Hey!
Hey!
It's true.
Oh...
What are you doing!
Hey!
That's my truck, man!
You can't keep me here, you know.
This is a men's prison.
I'm a woman.
It is clearly a violation of the, uh...
Geneva Convention.
And if I actually get violated, that's another violation.
So let me take a wild guess...
You just happened to be in the neighbourhood on the night that your brother and father broke out of jail?
No, stupid!
I was here because my stupid brother's stupid girlfriend was in stupid labour, so...
She is?
Where did they take her?
What can you do for me?
I'm up on tax evasion charges because of my dad's church scam...
I want immunity.
By the power invested in me by the town of Coverton, I now declare you not guilty, okay?
They were headed back into town.
Daddy and Richard were fighting about the dealership,
Ali was all like, "I'm havin' a baby, I'm a fuckin' idiot!", so...
Thank you.
Okay.
Arrest her.
What?
Aiding and abetting escaped prisoners.
You can't do that!
Put me down!
What the fuck!
Gentlemen...
It's been a pleasure.
We countersign when we get the money.
You get the $500,000 when you sign these documents.
Well, it would appear we are in the midst of a Mexican stand-off.
I blackmailed Elaine Fitzpatrick for her shares in this dealership.
You think I'm scared of you?
Sign!
Thank you.
If we did not need the money, never would I sell to that harpy!
They need both our signatures to sell, cousin...
And right now, she only has yours.
Swift thinking, cousin!
Once again, the Ruptals have tactical advantage.
Excellent.
Fitzpatrick Motors, currently run by the far superior cousins Ruptal.
Not for long, fucks.
I want to buy my dealership back.
I made a mint on that church scam.
It's the infirm Fitzpatrick!
He too wishes to purchase the dealership!
Let's negotiate.
Haggle!
You know, foreplay, for you ethnics.
The flashing lights of opportunity dance around us, cousin!
We will sell the dealership twice!
Meet us at the DUI.
Bring cash.
Fuck.
License and registration.
Of course.
My name is Paco.
Paco Vasquez.
I'm on my way to a costume party.
That's funny, Mr Vasquez.
You look an awful lot like an APB they just put out...
Ken Fitzpatrick.
Look, officer, I'm just trying to do a little business here.
Yeah, me too.
I got a buddy looking for you.
A real good buddy, if you know what I mean.
Fuck.
The gay mob.
Cocksucker!
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Out of the car.
Fuck!
Hey Fitzy!
I can see that orange jumpsuit from 5000 feet!
What the fuck, Josh?
Just here to get my stash, and I'm out of here, man.
No, no...
Fuck, Josh, I need your help!
Bad timing, Fitzy.
I gotta get out of the country before I kill the Ruptals.
You leave now, your C.O.'s just gonna send someone else.
Oh God, you're right, they're doomed.
You gotta help me save 'em!
No, fuck that, Josh!
I'm an escaped fucking felon!
I gotta figure out how to get this shit palace back before my kid is born!
You think you work for the government, you'll figure something out!
Know what, I was a government agent!
And I'm not gonna kill the Ruptals!
I need you to help save those men!
Both of them!
Larry, I do not want to have my baby in a garage!
What the fuck, Larry, you're supposed to take her to the hospital!
There's no time.
The head...
The head!
Will someone call me a fucking ambulance?
Look, as I have explained - repeatedly - we can't risk involving the authorities!
Richard is an escaped felon!
I'm not!
Try to hold on until I get my place back.
Fuck you!
Would someone just call me a cab?
You're a cab.
I'll call my own cab.
My kid is gonna have an old man that he can be proud of.
How much time do I have?
The contractions are four minutes apart.
Godspeed, Richard.
Godspeed!
I gotta lie down!
Listen, for the love of kid, I'll help you.
But you've gotta promise me...
You promise me that when you talk to the Ruptals, you will not tell them that I have to kill them.
Give me the dealership, pronto, or Josh will have to kill you.
Dude!
Really?
Josh, surely this is a joke.
Tell them.
Operation Blackout.
Terminate suspected terrorists
Ruptal Jhalalawan and Ruptal Jhalalatu.
With extreme prejudice.
It was nose hair clippers, okay?
I... I could never hijack a plane with nose hair clippers!
It's not just that.
The feds have a file on you a mile thick.
For what?
C-4 in your stationary closet?
No, that was me.
Or the jihad that you declared on Ken?
No, that was Fitz.
All this time, I was a mission?
I thought we were friends.
Hey, wait... wait!
You were a mission...
Became a friend.
Bottom line is you're dead men if you stay here.
You sign over your shares in the dealership to me, I'll get you new identities, a ride.
We'll fake your deaths.
I have no doubt you're an expert in faking things.
We'll give you until midnight.
Ring a ding ding.
Listen, I -
Cousin, this is perfect!
By the time they uncover our treachery, we'll be.. "dead".
We sell the dealership three times!
Wonderful!
Wish I were dead.
All right, you take care of the IDs, the car, and faking their deaths.
I'll get a burger.
Ruptal loved burgers.
With pickles.
[phone rings] Fuck.
Too late, shit bubble.
I just signed a deal with the Ruptals.
By midnight, the dealership will be mine.
I need to talk to you about something.
About what?
The father/son dance I was gonna ask you to.
What the fuck do you think?
The gay mob nabbed me off Exit 9.
I need you to get my Wurlitzer from the storage unit.
And why should I give a fuck?
Because you helped this repressed cock-lover get it out of Florida.
That puts both of you on my shit list!
[cocks gun] That's not a list you want to be on, sugar.
Look, just get the thing, will ya!
All right, fine.
I'll get your fuckin' Wurlitzer.
On one condition...
You're in no position to negotiate, slick.
I was talking to the half-sack.
I do this for you, you drop your bid for the dealership.
Got it?
Fuck.
Deal.
You got one hour.
Larry, get me out of here...
Don't think of this as a garage, think of it as an automotive birthing station.
Huh?
My child will be born in a crack den.
You couldn't put down some plastic first?
Where's Richard?
I don't know.
Don't worry, Ali Devon, I will find him.
You stay with her.
Tell me you know something about delivering a baby because I have no fucking idea.
Let Uncle Joshy handle this.
For he has an earthquake kit.
Ali-bear!
It's Chester!
Chester Vince!
Look, I don't care what some DNA test or a restraining order says, I am that child's father, okay?
I massaged that belly, and I sang to that foetus, and I was the one who slept on the couch!
So give me a chance!
A chance to be the most attentive father in the world!
Well, it's official.
Chester Vince has been appointed vacated seat of disgraced councillor and felon at large, Richard Fitzpatrick.
Don't forget your friends on the air, Mr. Vi-
Sweet mother of Zeus! [tires squeal]
Fuck me.
Didn't that twat farm ever throw anything away?
Ah!
Oh!
Richard?
Don't worry, I left Ali with Josh.
You fucking idiot!
I'm trying to show her I'm not a loser, and now Josh is the first face that kid is gonna see?
Right.
Fuck.
Oh, what's the fucking point?
The kid deserves better - not an old man who's a-
Don't you say it, Richard.
Because it is not true.
You are not the L word.
People do not depend on people who are the L word.
And right now, there are a lot of people depending on you, mister.
So you find your self-esteem, and we will find that jukebox.
You just have to dig a little deeper.
Is it a speech impediment that makes you always sound like a greeting card?
No, really, we just have to dig a little deeper.
Huh?
Here we go...
Well, looky-looky.
Ta da!
Huh?
Now what do you say we get a dilapidated Wurlitzer to a homicidal homosexual?
This thing is a piece of shit.
How come that fruit-cup has such a hard-on for it?
It's not worth 40 K.
It's gotta be some kind of scam.
That shit I said?
Yeah?
Fuck that.
Fitzy's no loser.
I'm a fuckin' genius.
Oh, let's see here.
Headlamp, hand-cranked radio/flashlight, cyanide pills, uh... Glowstick!
It's like a rave in a bucket!
Ever since I was a little girl with a doll and a toy stroller, I didn't want kids!
I don't even like kids!
Me neither!
Let's see here, uh...
All right!
Congratulations!
You've just survived an earthquake...
Oh!
God, what was I thinking?
A single thirty-something mother, no husband, no prospects, not a single shard of self-respect!
Oh!
I think I can see the baby!
Ha!
He's got short, curly black hair in the shape of a lightning bolt.
It kind of looks like Harry Potter!
Oh!
Okay...
Oh God!
Let's see!
Ah...
Good.
Very good.
That's it?
All you wanted was some fucking record?
Not just some record...
"The" record!
Bananarama's greatest hit?
Hey, watch your mouth, boy.
You're fucking with an antiques dealer.
A deal's a deal.
And you asked for the Wurlitzer, so...
It's all yours.
And it's a bitch to move.
Drive safe, Mr Vasquez.
If you're ever in Miami stay the fuck away from my shop.
See you later, old man.
I got a kid to make proud.
Not if I get there first.
Hey!
We had a fucking deal!
Yeah, that's cheating!
No, it's Fitzpatrick!
$300,000, cash!
Josh has your new identities.
There's a van on the lot, gassed and ready to go.
And by morning, the government will think you're dead.
Hm...
I'm talking real money here.
Give it!
I've got something that'll blow the geezer's offer out of the water.
Yeah!
Huh?
Give it!
Did you ever hear of the legend of the lost Sinatra single?
Uh-uh. Only an idiot has not.
Well here it is.
Frank's lone shot at a rock 'n' roll career reboot.
He only had one single pressed.
Hated it, and had the master tapes destroyed.
But a technician hid the 45 in the one place he knew Frank would never look.
The Wurlitzer!
From the Sands!
Motherfucker!
You switched it out!
Yeah.
[snickering] [whispering] This is wrong.
If we continue this lie, we are no better than they are.
Of course we are.
Lie!
Lie!
The only way you could beat the highest bidder, is by combining your offers.
In business with him?
No fucking way!
[gasp] Richard!
This is fate giving you a chance!
Look, for the sake of your child, and your grandchild -
I implore you as father and son, and mentor and servant, to finally bury this hatchet!
To work together!
To carry on tradition!
To shut me up!
Deal.
I'll handle the paperwork!
You've got a baby on the way, buddy.
Nice.
Motherfucker!
Somebody buy me a drink!
There's a mirror!
Do you want to see?
Oh, for the love of God, no!
All right, I did it!
I own this place now!
Fitzy's no loser.
I got this.
No, don't leave me alone with him!
Oh!
I don't care what you own!
You are the last person I want down there!
This isn't my first pilgrimage to your promise land, baby.
Now, you do what you gotta do.
Oh!
You did this to me, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you for this!
Yeah, anytime now.
Oh!
I will cut off a limb for every stretchmark you gave me!
That's good!
Good hustle!
Come on now!
Come on, one more!
I will shove a cinderblock up your asshole and make you shit it out!
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hey...
Oh fuck... [baby fussing]
Awesome.
Hey buddy.
All this time I've been vilifying Fitz, but at least he's been running around trying to make you proud.
What have I done?
Besides the biological miracle of growing you inside me...
As per your request, Miss Devon, a taxi is en route to take you to the hospital.
In the meantime,
Uncle Larry has just the thing to help get the little guy to sleep.
Your daddy's not a loser.
I am.
Your passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and library cards.
Oh, and uh...
I got you a little something as well.
Come on, come on!
Shut up!
You shut up!
Shut up!
Ruptal, listen...
No, don't.
I don't think I could ever forgive your lies, Josh.
I understand.
But, uh...
Craven Moorehead would like to thank you for saving his life.
Your accent's gettin' pretty good.
You're a good teacher.
Ah, just so I know...
How will we die?
I don't know yet.
But I do know one thing.
It'll be a death worthy of a friend.
Oh, and, uh...
I'm also gonna need some teeth.
Uh, hi, Ali, it's me.
Uh, listen, I'm gonna be a little bit late for our future.
Okay?
But everything's gonna be fine.
No matter what you heard.
It's all good.
They're gonna take me to the home world now.
But I'll be back soon, okay?
I'm ready!
You need a drink?
Now you're speaking my language.
Congratulations, Richard, Ken.
A new partnership, and a new Fitzpatrick.
I know your relationship isn't where you want it to be, but we've got plenty of time to work on that.
Especially if we don't get thrown back into jail the second we walk out this door.
[chuckles] [sigh] Ah, cheers.
I get the big office.
Fuck that.
I built that place from the ground up.
The big office is mine.
Actually, it's mine.
A sales contract?
You bought the dealership?
Bullshit.
Where'd you get the scratch to outbid us?
With the money I siphoned from the Ruptals' bank accounts.
Those oblivious idiots.
An unfinished contract means nada, Dot.
Only one signature.
Well... I still have Elaine's shares which makes us all partners.
Fuck.
Holy coincidence, or what!
Oh...
Rest in peace, my Ruptal brother.
Larry, tell me you've been keeping up our insurance premiums.
You know it, buddy.
With that money, we can build a place twice this size.
Yeah...
Once again, everything works out for good old Fitzy.
Ring a ding ding.
Rat bastard.
Motherfucker.
Burn, baby, burn.
Yeah.
Um...
You love when I take the whole thing in my mouth.
Don't you?
00:17:04,600 -- 00:17:06,100 I'm gonna cum for you, actually.
00:17:09,700 -- 00:17:10,700 I'm cumming in your mouth.
Hey...
I just finished decorating my tree...
What do you think?
Think it looks really pretty and it matches my pretty outfit that I dressed up for you.
My boobs look really good...
Nice and big...
Do you like these gloves?
I think they're really sexy.
Also, I have a little surprise just for you.
See?
I'm wearing no underwear.
I think it looks really sexy with this skirt.
Do you like to watch them bouncing up and down?
So, let's see what Santa got me for Christmas.
Look what I got:...
Cute little pink toy to match my outfit.
Do you want to watch me play with it?
Get it all wet.
I love spitting on it.
Do you like watching me play with myself?
Oh...
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Um...
Tastes so good;
I wish you could taste it.
Do you want me to turn it on for you?
Hope you guys enjoyed that and happy holidays.
That's me.
Jane Quimby.
My life is a little complicated right now.
I landed my fashion dream job working for her,
Gray Chandler Murray.
The only problem, they think I'm an adult.
Now I am juggling two secret lives, one in high school and one in high fashion.
Do you trust India?
I just think she's a little shady.
I'm afraid we have to say goodbye.
I hope you're happy.
You did this to yourself, India.
You got the wrong person.
All right, fellas.
Here's how it's going down.
Are you robbing this place, Tommy?
Let's go!
Let's go!
A couple months at New Hall Youth Detention might give Mr. Nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications.
I saw her with Nick.
They were kissing, Janey.
It's not what you think.
- Just let me...
- Don't.
I can't talk to you.
And you really deserve the perfect guy, Rita Shaw.
You are perfect.
I really have no idea how to say this.
So I'm just gonna say it.
It's you, Janey.
Jane.
Jane!
Let's go.
You're gonna be late for school again, truant.
That guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard.
You know how Miss Shaw can be.
Ben.
It's a little weird that you call your girlfriend "Miss Shaw."
Oh, you mean Rita.
Hey.
Are you really that busy?
Yes.
And no.
I'm nervous, Ben.
Two months is a long time.
What if Billy's different?
What if he doesn't want to see me?
Jane. He was in a juvenile detention center, not a brainwashing camp.
You'll be the first person he wants to see.
Besides, why would anything be different with you two?
Well, the thing is I might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show.
See, when Billy showed up he sort of...
Well, he...
I'm waiting.
Bated breath over here.
He said something.
And would you like to tell me what that something was, exactly?
He said, "It's you."
- It's you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy.
- What?
Then what happened?
Well, then Jeremy came in and I didn't know what to do and then Billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it's been playing on a loop in my head.
"It's you, it's you, it's you." What do you think it means?
Well, I may be totally off-base here, but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically?
No.
No, no, no.
I did think that for a second.
But I don't think that's it.
But I guess it can be.
I don't know.
Maybe it is.
I don't know.
Would that be so weird?
Well, he's my best friend and I don't want to run the risk of ruining that, right?
- I can't answer that.
- Then what good are you?
Just go pick up Billy and you two will figure it out.
You know why?
Because you guys are like this.
You can figure out anything.
I sure hope so.
I missed you.
I missed you, too, Janey.
Jane By Design 1x11
- The Replacement Original air date June 5, 2012
That's it?
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what else to say.
It was pretty uneventful.
You were in a juvenile detention center.
So?
So, was it scary?
Were the guards mean?
Did you make any friends?
How was the food?
Did you...
Jane. Look.
I wasn't in Alcatraz or anything, okay?
I just...
I'd rather talk about something else, okay?
Okay.
Maybe we should talk about, you know...
Yeah, you!
So, what about you?
What's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since I've been away?
Oh. Nothing, really.
- How's Jeremy?
- Jeremy?
Yeah, you guys are together, right?
No.
We've never been together.
He doesn't even know that I'm in high school.
And we work together.
I could never do that.
Speaking of work.
How is it?
Well, things have been crazy ever since India got fired.
Gray has been using me for everything.
It's nuts.
And she's been through at least a dozen people to fill India's job.
Wow.
That's a lot of people.
Tell me about it.
And you should see the stuff that she's having me do.
I can't even believe it.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love being creatively involved at Donovan Decker...
You okay?
Let's just say to be back here again.
And this place same way about me.
Don't worry about them.
And, Billy...
Yeah?
Are we okay?
Shouldn't we, talk or something?
You've been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car, Jane.
Right.
I mean, about...
We're good.
Yeah.
There's nothing for us to talk about, okay?
Unless you want to talk about that.
You have got to be kidding me.
Yep.
Lulu and Nick.
They've been an item ever since you left school.
Looks like it's just back to being the two of us.
Yeah.
The two of us.
Jane, I have to be honest.
I'm a little disappointed.
Disappointed?
I'm just surprised.
That's all.
This progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the Jane Quimby that I know.
Your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics.
Well, that's good, right?
- Your brother got an A in ceramics.
- Ouch.
And it's not just your grades.
Your attendance last month?
Let's just say it was less than perfect.
I know.
I'm sorry.
This internship is interfering with your life.
Your grades aren't what they used to be, you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can't happen.
I know, I know.
But I'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job.
I mean, I'm already here.
This is my life.
It's just an internship, Jane.
It's not.
I'm working with designers and I'm being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can't learn in a classroom.
I'm living it every day.
You can't buy that kind of experience, you know?
Fine.
But I need to see some real changes.
Because if this doesn't improve, I can't sign off on the internship program for you next semester.
Especially if you're not...
Wait.
Are you texting someone right now?
Uh, what?
No.
I am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school.
Stat.
I promise I'll get things back on track at school.
You have my word.
Sorry.
I know this might sound harsh, but you've been an incredible disappointment, Sally.
It's Suzy.
Your work has been lackluster.
Your ideas, well, you simply have none.
In your time here at Donovan Decker, you've yet to show any real promise.
But I've only been working here for two days.
Two days too many, I'm afraid.
You're fired.
That'll be all.
What?
That's five this month, Gray.
Well, it's been harder to replace India than I might've realized.
Perhaps if you...
But I'm not worried.
I have a new prospect in mind.
Someone young and unexpected.
Someone not boxed in by years of design experience.
You don't mean...
You're not talking about...
I have to go.
My next appointment is here.
Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Martyn!
Gray, darling!
So. Classic.
Clean.
Powerful.
It's a whole new delicious look to match your title of Creative Director.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
I'm afraid I don't.
I love it.
You're a genius.
Thank you, Carter.
Girl, how many hats does Gray have you wearing right now?
More than you own.
I doubt that.
Am I the only one that's twice as busy since India left?
I think we're all starting to feel the pressure.
But you more than anyone.
'Cause whenever Gray says jump...
I say, "Over whom?" And, "In pumps or flats?"
I just really hope this new girl works out.
Well, don't get your hopes up.
Hey.
What can I do for you, muffin?
That's a "no" on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing.
Yeah, I know.
It didn't quite feel right coming out.
I need the kids here to respect me, Ben.
We need to be professional.
Got it.
We're on the same page.
So, what's up?
I had a conversation with Jane this morning.
I'm just a little concerned.
Don't worry.
She's good with it.
- With what?
- With us dating.
No. Ben. I'm concerned about Jane.
I just got her progress report and she's falling behind.
I think this internship is just too demanding on her, don't you?
Actually, I kind of think it's been good.
But I promise I'll make sure she stays focused on school.
You know why?
Because your love life depends on it?
Bingo.
I know you've all been working tremendously hard lately.
But you're gonna have to work tremendously harder.
Donovan Decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world's most famous luxury department stores,
Harrods.
That is, unless we blow it.
And we cannot blow it.
Understood?
Okay.
Didn't I fire you?
No.
Oh.
See me in my office afterwards.
The style director assigned to oversee our Harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow.
Now, can anyone tell me what is our number one priority?
Carter?
Um, to impress the style director and ensure Harrods is confident that Donovan Decker has what it takes?
Precisely.
Now, I need all hands on deck for the next two days.
No exceptions.
Is that clear?
If that is clear, then walk away and get back to work.
Now.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
As long as Gray doesn't see.
Because apparently, we're all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before.
Whatever that means.
Did you hear that she fired Sally?
- Do you mean Suzy?
- Right.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm turning into Gray, aren't I?
- Jane...
- Not that that would be a bad thing.
- I just think... What?
- Jane!
I'm going to tell you something and I need you not to react, okay?
- Okay?
- No, no, no, no.
I'm serious, Jane.
Okay.
Gray is giving you India's old job.
What?
Me?
No reaction.
Right.
Take over India's job?
I am so not ready for that.
Then you best get ready.
Janey?
You ready?
Almost!
I'll be out in a minute!
- Morning, Miss Shaw.
- Good morning, Billy.
You mind handing me the milk?
Yes.
Of course.
Oh, and Miss Shaw?
Yes, Billy?
I think your toast is ready.
Wait.
You're actually considering this?
No.
Yes?
I don't know.
I mean, taking India's old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime.
How could I say no?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I...
I just...
You'd really consider leaving here?
Just leaving school behind?
Maybe.
Why?
No reason.
Talk to me, Billy.
No, I'm good.
Oh, you're good?
Is that right?
Yeah. It is.
- Fine.
Whatever.
- So, now you're mad at me?
Yeah.
I am.
Billy, you've been shutting me out.
About everything.
What is going on with you?
And how can I help if you won't even talk to me?
What do you want to talk about?
For starters, how about the fashion show?
You ran out before we could even have a conversation.
It was nothing, Janey.
Nothing?
That's your story?
Look, I was in a bad place.
I was getting sent away.
That's it.
There's nothing for us to talk about.
Things are different now.
I'm different.
Yeah, tell me about it.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you have changed.
And, if you ask me, it's not for the better.
I didn't ask you, Jane.
Fine!
Then be that way!
- I will!
- Well, then do it!
I said I will!
What was that about?
I don't know, Ben.
Maybe I took your advice and I tried to talk to him about the whole "it's you" thing and maybe it backfired.
Sorry about that.
I'm worried about Billy.
It can't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here.
Well, maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on?
Such as?
I don't know, maybe an activity or something?
Like mathletes.
Or chess club.
- I'm being serious, Rita.
- So am I.
Come on.
Chess?
Mathletes?
What, do you want him to be more of an outcast?
Those are terrible clubs.
I was in those clubs, Ben.
And you were adorable doing it.
Shoot.
Vice Principal Jenkins!
What a surprise to see you!
In the hall.
At school.
Where we work.
Hey, Rita.
What're you naughty kids up to this fine morning?
Naughty?
Why would you even...
We are... Were...
We were just talking.
That is all.
I said "mop"!
- And I'll stop talking now.
- Good idea.
Good morning, Jenkins.
Good morning, Rita.
And...
Ben.
That was close.
No.
That was awkward.
Really awkward.
What's gotten into you?
You said you want to keep it professional at work, right?
- Do you think he knows?
- Knows what?
About you and me, of course.
How would he know that, Ben?
Are you kidding?
We ooze chemistry.
Don't say ooze.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you, Billy?
Oh, you know how it is, just trying to get my bearings back.
- That's good.
- Yep.
So, what's been going on with you?
Sorry.
Stupid question.
So, you and Fadden, huh?
How's that one working out for you?
To be honest, I thought it was going pretty well.
That is until you got back.
I thought I could forget about us, b...
There is no more us, Lu.
But I really do hope things between you and Nick work out.
Because you deserve it.
You're precipitating.
- Excuse me?
- Your calcium is starting to form a precipitate.
You should dry out the crystals.
Oh.
Um...
Thanks.
- Busy, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
You're not gonna cut me any slack here, are you?
Maybe.
But just a little.
Okay.
I guess I deserve that.
I'm really sorry, Jane.
For what it's worth, I made a big mistake.
Huge, in fact.
And I regret it.
It's fine.
Really, I'm just distracted.
And you know what?
I think it all worked out for the best.
You and Lulu seem very happy.
Yeah.
The thing is...
I...
Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's just, um...
Oh, I, uh...
I have to go.
Oh.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You wanted to see me, Ben?
Good hands.
Good hands.
Thanks.
First day back.
How're you doing?
I'm fine, Ben.
Oh, I get it.
This must be the part where you ask me how I'm adjusting.
No, I just thought now that you're back, you might want to hit the ground running.
Find a positive outlet.
For what?
I don't know, something to keep you busy.
Focus your energy.
Such as...
How about football?
Seriously?
Yeah.
You got a pair of hands on you.
I mean, you're a little stringy, but you're probably very elusive.
Hard to tackle.
Baseball?
Oh, my.
Are you kidding me right now?
Why not just give it a shot?
Look, Ben.
I appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you're trying to do here.
But, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm not really the team sport type.
Are you sure you're doing okay?
I'm fine.
Because, Jane told me about...
Do you really want to do this, Benjamin?
- I'd like to.
- I'd prefer if we didn't.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
I have to leave school because of an emergency at work and Rita can't know under any circumstances because then I would lose my internship and that can't happen.
So I really need you guys to help me out okay?
Can you cover for me?
- I don't think so.
- No way.
What?
Look, I know that you are mad at me and that you don't really like to do this sort of thing, but can't you just cover for me?
Maybe like a cold, cramps, anything.
I don't like lying to Rita.
It's just a teeny-tiny little white lie.
And that's how it all starts.
That's correct.
Fine.
I don't need your help.
I can handle this on my own.
Oops.
Sorry.
Sorry.
That's okay.
Hey, I'm actually a little lost.
Oh, well, maybe I can point you in the right direction.
Who are you delivering those to?
You think I'm a flower delivery guy?
I did.
A second ago.
But now I'm a little unsure.
They're for Gray Chandler Murray.
Oh. Great.
I'm Gray's assistant.
Jane.
So I can just take those to her.
I'd rather give them to her myself if that's okay.
The thing is Gray's not exactly the hand delivery type.
What type is she?
She's more of a "don't bother me with that kind of crap" type.
So, if you're not the flower delivery guy, who are you?
Eli.
I have an appointment with Gray.
Today?
No, it's tomorrow.
I just thought I'd get here early in case I got lost.
Why would you get here a whole day...
Oh, that was a joke.
- Funny.
- You didn't laugh.
Well, it wasn't laugh out loud funny.
The thing is Gray doesn't have any appointments today.
Well, she called me directly.
Gray?
Called you?
On the phone?
Yeah.
Crazy, right?
So, what is this appointment about?
Something about a job opening.
A job.
And you're interviewing for it?
Yeah.
Are you gonna point me in the right direction or should I...
Oh, gosh.
Yes, sorry.
Right this way.
So, you got any tips for me?
Tips?
Yeah, you know, like advice for the interview.
Oh, um, just don't take anything Gray says to you personally.
She can be a little cold.
So, you're saying she's mean?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not mean.
- She's just not very...
- Nice?
Eli, you're here!
Oh!
And you brought me flowers.
Yeah, well, I haven't seen you in a while.
And I know lilies are your favorite.
Jane, I see you've met my nephew, Eli.
Yeah, we...
Nephew?
Yeah.
Jane was actually just talking about you.
Oh. And what did she say?
Only that you're warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented.
Is that right?
That is right.
Eli, come into my office.
Jane, hold all my calls.
It was nice to meet you, Jane.
Nephew?
Who is that?
His name is Eli.
I don't like the look of him.
Well, you should probably keep that one to yourself.
And why is that?
Because he is Gray's nephew.
And from the looks of it, he might also be India's new replacement.
He seems great.
He is.
Something you want to add?
No.
I...
Spit it out, Jane.
I just...
I feel a little silly saying this, but for a second there I thought that I was in the running for India's job.
You are.
Where's Jane?
My sister, Jane?
Yes, Ben.
Your sister Jane.
I heard she went home early.
And right after I had that talk with her.
Did you know about this?
Yes. I am aware of her departure.
What'd she say?
She said some things about cramps.
Cramps.
Cramps. You know, lady stuff.
I'm not that familiar with lady stuff, so I'd really rather not discuss it.
Hi, Billy.
Hello, Miss Shaw.
I heard Jane went home.
She okay?
She'll be fine.
Just a cold.
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.
- A cold?
- Yeah.
All right, peace.
White chocolate half-caff latte.
Your favorite.
And I picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning.
And I got you a reservation tomorrow night at Per Se.
I thought you said they were booked up for the next two months.
They are. I pulled some strings.
Well done, Jane.
And I thought you might like to take a look at these.
- What's this?
- Some sketches.
Of mine.
Just some new ideas for the accessories line.
I'll take a look.
Impressive.
You're still here.
Yeah, Gray said I should stick around a while and check out the place.
Is that right?
It is.
That's nice.
Hey.
Hello, Jane.
Can I ask you a question?
- You just did.
- What?
You asked if you could ask me something.
Technically, that is a question.
Sometimes you are way too British.
There's no such thing.
Okay, come on, I'm serious, Jeremy.
At your service, Miss Quimby.
Okay, so about this whole job offer thing.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
In what respect?
Well, in that I'm an assistant.
And the closest I've come to studying design is, I don't know, the endless hours I spent and fashion magazines every weekend.
This is a huge job.
Why would Gray trust me to handle something like this?
Because you can.
Eli seems way more qualified and he's...
He's nothing to worry about.
You have to run your own race, Jane.
And you, you've got what it takes.
You really think so?
I know so.
Plus, you deserve it.
Thank you.
I just really don't know if this is the right thing for me right now.
Are you insane?
I have a lot of stuff going on at home.
My best friend was away for a while and now he's back and...
Is this the same friend from the fashion show?
Isn't he the reason you turned me down?
Jeremy, we've talked about this.
You're my mentor and my friend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No need to rub it in.
All I'm saying is I don't know if it's the right time to leave him...
To leave him behind.
That is why he was so upset.
I'm not really following your chain of thought here.
Oh, it's nothing.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you for all of your help.
You're welcome.
Sup?
Wow!
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...
- Hey, you.
- What's going on with you?
I was parched.
You're avoiding me.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to keep things discreet.
Between us.
You know?
You're lying to me about Jane.
What?
No.
Billy said she has a cold.
- That was me!
- You said she had cramps.
Did not.
I have to go.
Go where?
I have to go to the house to check on Jane.
You've got me really worried about these cold cramps.
That's a great idea. I'm going with you.
And if Jane isn't home sick in bed, that internship of hers is over.
- You have to get Jane home!
Now!
- What happened?
The collective brain power of you and me.
That's what happened.
You said cramps, didn't you?
There's no time for blame.
Yes. I said cramps.
You just couldn't stay out of it, could you?
I told Rita that I was going home to check on Jane, and now she's coming with me.
So Jane has to be home, in bed, sick, and fast.
I thought we were staying out of it.
Can't you just call her?
I've called her like a dozen times.
It keeps going to voicemail.
Ben, it's just the whole racing to save Jane thing, it's not really my problem anymore.
Look.
I'm not happy about this either, and I know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now, but she needs us.
Otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window.
She's my sister.
I can't bring myself to do that to her.
Can you?
I can't compete with this guy.
Trust me.
She's not going to hire her nephew.
You sure about that?
Look, I didn't go to school for design.
And I know my technique isn't exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people.
But, given the chance, I might be able to bring something new to the table here at Donovan Decker.
Something different.
Something fresh.
Now I heard that you're already selling your own line, is that true?
I do what I can.
Mostly, right now I'm just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street.
Honestly, the money I make barely covers materials, but I love it.
And that's what it's all about.
Yeah, I think so, too, Carter.
Are you listening to this?
He's perfect.
He's charming and talented and good-looking
He's not that good-looking.
I'm serious, Jeremy.
There's no way I actually have a chance of getting this job.
Not if I'm up against a guy like that.
Which I am.
Please. It's a courtesy, Jane.
A family obligation.
This is Gray we're talking about.
She's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to.
Good point.
You are probably right.
Yeah, I'm always right.
You said we were leaving to check on Jane 20 minutes ago.
And we are.
I just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way.
Ten minutes, Ben.
And then we're going.
Understood?
Understood.
And if I find out you are lying, we're gonna have a serious issue.
I'm pleased to announce that I have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by India Jourdain.
- It's you.
- What?
I'm certain of it.
This person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style.
This person is destined to be a rising star here at Donovan Decker.
This person is...
Wait!
What, Jane?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I can't.
Can't?
I can't do this.
I'd like to take myself out of the running.
I'm so sorry, Gray.
I really am grateful.
I just...
I don't think I'm ready for this.
And I agree.
Which is why I'm pleased to introduce our newest designer,
Eli Chandler.
Billy, what are you doing here?
- We need to get you home.
- What happened?
What do you think happened?
Ben said cramps, didn't he?
Yeah. You know your brother doesn't think fast on his feet.
This is true.
And now Miss Shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed.
What do you think's faster right now?
5th or Lex?
We're gonna have to...
You came for me.
I did.
And I'm not gonna let that be for nothing.
Come on.
We have to get you home. Now.
Jane, I'm on my way to the house.
I've stalled as long as I can and I just can't keep lying to Rita.
Your chariot awaits.
Mmm-hmm.
Drive.
Now.
What was that for?
No reason.
- Oh, this is a shortcut.
- Oh!
Come on, Janey!
Oh, wait.
Pajamas!
Jane?
Jane?
Are you feeling okay?
Maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit.
Wait a minute.
What is going on here?
Oh, hey guys.
I'm feeling much...
Much better.
I just have a cold.
And cramps.
So I just needed to...
Double whammy.
Hmm. Well, feel better, okay, Jane?
Thanks, Miss Shaw.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
- For what?
For the whole manhunt thing.
Coming down on you.
Honestly, I feel terrible for questioning you, accusing you of lying.
I don't know what got into me.
I think you're just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors, that's all.
Thank you.
That was far, far too close.
Tell me about it.
Oh, my gosh.
And how about me turning down that job that I wasn't even being offered?
So embarrassing.
It wasn't so bad.
Okay, it was pretty bad.
I counted eight people cringing.
Did you count me?
Okay.
Nine.
I know you wanted that job.
Honestly, I wasn't ready to leave being a teenager behind just yet.
And I am definitely not ready to leave you.
Two months away.
It was a long time, Billy.
I missed you.
I missed you, too, Janey.
Being away was terrible and lonely.
But knowing you'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through.
I have to ask you...
You said, "It's you,"
and I need to know if you meant...
I meant
that it's you, Janey.
You are my best friend.
The very best.
And I don't want that to ever change.
Because that's what's most important, right?
Yeah.
It is.
Remember.
We must impress this Harrods style director at any cost.
Donovan is depending on us.
Hello, losers.
That's right.
I'm the one you've been waiting for.
Where's Jane?
I can't wait to catch up.

Get in the car! Who are you?
I'm the man whose money you took. He'll get done, sooner or later. I made a call.
The VAT man.
Well done on bringing us the money. Welcome to Morocco.
Help! HELP! For your own sake, I suggest you answer these questions truthfully.
Why are you on this boat?
That's... er... That's all of us going on a fishing trip.
I remember that day... happy times.
You are putting a bag in the car. What was it?
Probably fishing gear.
Bax?
Quinn?
Tell me about this, please.
Where did you learn how to do this?
What is happening here?
That's... that's just lads on holiday, innit?
You know, things get a bit out of control.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hello?
Who are you?
Where are my friends?
You all OK?
They... shaved me. And they bust my new glasses.
Where are we?
Said Morocco, didn't they?
Yeah, I know that. But where?
Did they show you the pictures?
What pictures?
What do you say to 'em Rick? Nothing.
Obviously. Don't tell them anything, all right.
Not until we get some kind of legal representation. Someone from the embassy - Amnesty or someone. How you gonna get in touch with them?
Who are they anyway?
They're some kind of militia or something, aren't they?
They knew we had that money. They picked us off. They're probably using the money for some extremist movement.
He was wearing a shirt, with a Marks and Spencer's label on. I saw it sticking out.
Who? My interrogator. I mean, extremists...
They might.
Shall we go and help him?
Best not to get involved.
You all right, mate?
It's a woman. Serious. It's a bird!
Argh! I was just trying to see if you were OK. I'm Quinn.
What sort of fag name is that?
Dunno. Ask my dad. Named after my grandfather, I think.
I'm Mercedes. Hi.
- Your dad into cars then?
- Heard of the Count of Monte Cristo, dumb fuck?
Yeah... no... yeah - fuck, I dunno, I can't remember.
Can I just ask, what's with all the rough stuff?
It's what they do if you don't tell them what they want. Who are they?
A bunch of COCKSUCKERS! Come on! Do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the British Government?
Yeah, it's easy. They're in there. Eh?
What?
It's the Foreign Office. Sorry. What is this place exactly?
It's where they bring people to question... ..when they don't want anyone to know they're doing it.
A week ago, I was standing in line, holding a tuna baguette, queuing up for easyJet. Now I'm being fucking renditioned!
"Dear God, please help me see danger coming my way, "and forgive the body count I will be sending your way."
"Never pick up a dead man's gun." "I... "..heart...
Right. We should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever's in charge and make them understand they can't just keep us here. There's laws and protocols...
You think they'll care about that? They still have to abide by them.
Woody, this is our government. Governments can't just hold us indefinitely for no reason. What you on about?
Course they can! They do it all the time. You remember those plane spotters in Greece?
They said they were spies. And what about Guantanamo?
Nobody even knew who was in there. Get off! Come on!
All right?
How did you end up here then, love?
I was in Kabul, "love".
You in the army then?
No, I went there because I like the opera.
Didn't like what I saw, so I went AWOL. Took a long fucking walk. Posted some things on the web.
Secrets? There are no secrets. Only hidden truths.
How long do they usually keep people in here for? As long as they want. That's the point.
Fellas, can I... have a word? In private.
This could be a trick. She could be working for them.
You not seen her face?
What, you not talking to me now?
I ain't the enemy. Anyway, if I wanted info out of you, I'd just.... ..beat it out of you.
Ever had a cauliflower ear, Quinn? Or a wet willy?
You know what Churchill said?
Fuck off!
"If you're going through hell, keep going".
Tough it out, guys! You can get through this. You got each other for a start.
Put our time to good use. Only trying to help, knobhead. Well, you're not.
So, what, do you think it's somehow harder for you, Quinn?
I don't think anything, Bax. Because I'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the Sahara fucking desert. And why am I here?
Because you persuaded me that a weekend away would be "a laugh". I persuaded you? You called me.
I've never called you, Baxter. I've never called you because I cannot bear your incessant moaning and complaining. Oh, right, great - thanks.
Yup. Here we go. Here we go.
Nice toughing it out guys.
Oi, Quinnbo, you know there's no "I" in team, don't you? No. But there's a "U" in "fuck you".
What's going on?
Stop it! Get off! Get off me!
Help! Get off! What's happening?
Please, don't. Let go! Where are you taking him?
Leave him alone! BAX! Get your hands off him, you slags!
I watched the door all night to see if he'd come out. Yeah, me too.
Shit, no... Come on. Let's not think the worst.
Hiya. I think there's more grub on the side. Just help yourself.
We've been worried sick. You've been gone all night. What happened?
I dunno... weird. They asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all, you know, tea and toast.
You should get some. Come, please. Oi!
Sit.
Fortunately for you... ..we're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days.
All we wanted to know was who you were financing. We weren't financing anyone.
We were just trying to get home. With five million euros?
We have at our disposal DNA databases, forensic analysis, satellite imaging technology. If that doesn't give us what we need, we employ enhanced interrogation techniques.
If we want to find out the truth, we do. And now, we have.
We made a mistake. It happens. So...
Just sign these and we'll get you to the airport and on a flight.
Hang on. Does that mean that we can...? Please don't ask if you can keep the money.
Do you want us to do anything for you, back home?
Little candle-lit vigil?
Coloured rubber wrist bands - "Free Mercedes".
Take care.
Mrs Peters. 101 Bridge Road, Crawley. It's my mum. Just let her know I'm all right.
You take care of yourself.
Seriously?
Did you really think we were going to get out of there?
Two nights in. Nah... thought that was it.
What went through your mind?
Well, first of all, my kids... Carmen, and then just like, stupid stuff, like... I thought I'd never get to see United play again.
I kept thinking of my kids. Kept seeing their little faces. Then I thought about Nina....
I wouldn't be there to tell them that that's not what I'm like. Be honest, kid, you were worried about her finding your porno collection. Nah, I don't know.
They might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together, saying they were going to Spain and actually ending up in Morocco.
If anyone so much as mentions "bad luck", they're walking. Be a long walk back, pal, we've been driving for nearly an hour. Haven't seen so much as a camel.
He's gone.
He's not coming back, is he?
Two stay, two go and get help. Shouldn't we all go? Why?
Or stay? We'll double our chances if we split. Halve them you mean.
I do. I do. I do.
I'll go. Come on. You two stay here, if the driver comes back, just all stay with the car, all right?
Do you believe in destiny, Bax? No.
So shut up.
Fate then?
Rick, please. No destiny, no fate, no karma, no spells, no curses.
This is just a series of misunderstandings, OK?
Could have happened to anybody. No more, no less.
Who's...?
Come on!
Get in. You are about to be shot, get in!
Bax, get in.
Woods! Quinn! Hey!
- We had some disturbing intel. - Well, if it's bad news can you just lie to me?
I'd like to know what's going on, please. A covert department of the CIA, the Special Activities Division has activated a kill contract on you. Sorry?
What are you talking about? Evidently, you've intersected a line of narco-finance and... Wait.
Your man in Majorca... ..has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the American security services. What?
He's paying the CIA to protect him?
Narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for American black ops. - Like a five-year-old, please.
Not really new news. Why would they want to kill us?
One of you tipped off the authorities in the UK. A contact inside Customs and Excise.
Your man here retaliated by telling the Special Activities Division you were about to blow their op wide open. So now they have to take you out. No, this... this is crazy.
This goes higher than us. This kind of thing brings down governments. Iran Contra anyone?
Which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation. They can't just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together. Under the aegis of "the global war on terror", they can shoot anyone they like.
The CIA? No.
They'd have tasked local contractors. So nothing can be linked back to them. You got lucky...
But this isn't going to go away. OK, let's get practical, then. So what are the options?
Well, there must be something?
Right... Right - there may be a solution but we have to act now. Like, this minute.
Then I'm afraid you're on your own. How long would this be for?
Maybe for ever.
- We can never go home?
- It's the only offer on the table.
No, no, no, that's... That's not an option.
No. I'm going home and... If you go back, you'll be putting your families at risk as well.
OK, let me just see if this is even logistically possible.
Stand up. Get up.
We can do it. We have a scrambled phone link. You can each of you make one phone call home but you must not, under any circumstances, tell them where you are and what is happening.
Amy... Yeah, I know, I'm sorry that I haven't rung.
Listen to me for a second, love. Nina... Just stop, just let me talk, darling, OK?
Right... There's no easy way of saying this, OK, so I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm not coming back.
If I've only got one call, which one do I call? You can't make me choose. I need you to phone my folks,
Where are they?
Shit... I want you to tell the girls that I love them both very much... I don't know how long.
..because that is not what's happened. I've met someone.
Oh, Amy... Please, just tell the kids, OK, that it's not because of them, I'm sorry Nina.
No, no, everything's fine. It's just... I think I'm going to stay out here a little longer.
What?
Well, what happened to your satellite dish?
I can't hear you Rachel, say that again.
Take care?
Yeah, OK. I will. You too.
Fuck... No, no, you're right, I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't swear. Dad, listen to me, OK?
You've been brilliant, Dad.
Yeah, just take care. Yeah... I love you, Dad.
I know you all think it's my fault, don't you? You think it's my fault because I phoned the VAT man.
It's nobody's fault, Rick. It's just... I don't know, the universe conspiring against us or something.
A fly saved my life. What?
Out in the desert. If it hadn't been for that fly, I'd have had my head blown off. And the weird thing was, we'd met before.
Any idea where we're going yet?
Is that a don't know, or won't say?
Bax?
What you going to call yourself?
What do you mean?
Your name.
We can't use our own names right?
Hey... I'm gonna be Floyd. That's what I'm gonna call myself.
You can't call yourself that. Why?
It's a black name. Is it?
It's like calling yourself... Everton or Tyrell, or something. You can't.
Tony Smith. My name's Tony... Smith.
Why can't I be Tony Smith? You call yourself whatever you like, mate. Sir Tony Smith if you want, mate.
If I was a girl, I'd call myself... ..well, Hope. You could be Bob Hope. New hope.
New house.
Jamie.... Jamie Kirk, then. Blake...
Tony Smith, Adam Newhouse, Jamie Kirk and... ..Blake Hatch. Hatch. Welcome to your new fucking lives.
Where are we?
South Africa.
We're on the other side of the world. Do they speak English here?
Uh... I think so. What's it like?
I don't know. This will all sort out, won't it?
Eh? A week from now, we'll be in a pub in London, we'll be laughing about this. Some rand to get you through the first few weeks.
How do we get in touch with you?
You don't. Right, OK. - How do we keep in touch?
- You won't be able to. It's too dangerous. Hang on a minute.
What happens if it's safe for us, if it becomes safe for us to go home, to break cover? How will we know that?
As far as anyone else knows now, you don't exist. That's your best chance of surviving. If you want to stay alive, stay invisible.
The truth will come out though, won't it? In the end. OK, let's go.
Say your goodbyes. Come on, move this thing along. Come on, people.
Take care of yourselves.
Woody.
Hey, we shouldn't be on our own. Listen, I know I said some things... ..but you boys mean a lot to me, all right? And you always will.
Quinn, Quinn, come on. Guys, come on, we should stay together, yeah? We're a team now.
Right, boys... Chin up. At least we're still standing, eh?
You'll be all right, Bax. What makes you say that?
You're smart. I'm not that fucking smart.
Good luck.
Hey. What about if just me and him, we stick together?
- It'll be all right, won't it? - No. - Listen, nobody has to know.
You'll be all right. I can't do this Woody. Yes, you can.
You're strong, mate. You're stronger than you think. No, I'm not.
Woods, let's not do it, yeah? You and me, we'll stay together, yeah?
Woods... Woody... Woody, let me go with you, yeah?
Please, Woody. Woody, let me come with you, please. Hey!
Woody... Woody, I don't want to be on my own! Woody, please.
Woody, mate. Don't leave me, please. Woody!
I know every disgraced politician, every gem smuggler, every high-stakes gambler and gold digger that come through those doors. Why you never go away?
You don't even leave Cape Town. If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? Yeah, why don't you marry me and take me to England?
Your name isn't Newhouse is it?
How dare you, and how dare you try and blackmail me!
Help!
Previously on Siberia... (Indistinct shouting)
A tiger!
A fucking tiger!
I couldn't believe it.
It was like something a seven year old would tell me...
"Oh, I saw a tiger in the woods..."
- What are you doing?
- Wondering what would do that to a tiger.
Oh, hell.
It's on fire...
and it's green...
- What's on fire?
- The sky.
You know, there's something about Carolina.
I feel like I recognize her.
- Fire in the woods, man.
- (Man) Got to get some water.
I told you this was a mistake!
That's all we had, man.
That's all we had.
Does anyone recognize this?
We found Johnny's shirt.
And it was full of food from the shed.
(Johnny) I get what it looks like.
I see that.
But I didn't steal the food, and I didn't burn down the shed.
Someone obviously doesn't like me, and they're trying to set me up.
People weren't taking too kindly me being at camp 'cause apparently I stole food from the shed and then burned it down.
Someone framed me.
They wrapped my shirt around some food, hid it in the woods.
I don't know who did it.
You know, frankly, I don't really care anymore, you know?
I don't really need them anyways.
You know, obviously, I can take care of myself.
Took them how long to build a fire?
I did it in five minutes in the dark.
(Daniel) I can't believe
Johnny's gonna just stay out in the woods.
That's crazy.
And why shouldn't he?
After all the crap that he's pulled?
He'll be fine.
And if he's not, you got a better chance of winning.
And you can keep his bed.
I want to make it to the end, but I want to do it as a team, kind of like how Neeko's doing it, you know?
Can I tell you something?
(Daniel) Sure.
You're a smart guy.
You know that Neeko is a professional athlete?
He plays game for living.
How about maybe he's playing this game that he's a very nice guy, everybody trusts him, just to win the game?
Have you ever thought about it?
I don't think you should trust him.
(Sam) Can't trust anybody.
Guys?
I get up early, and as soon as I open the door, I practically ran into this spear that's stuck in the ground.
It felt like a threat.
Let me see.
(Woman) What does it say?
It says... (Speaks Russian)
(Woman) What is that?
It means "get out."
It's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell's going on here.
It's a nice prop.
Look at it.
It's not real.
Nice scare tactic.
They're watching.
I'm sure they're loving this.
(Woman) Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours?
Who wants you guys to get out?
(Man) Well, this is here on purpose.
That's for sure.
It's here on purpose.
It's here for a reason.
You guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this, really?
(Daniel) Who else could've left that spear?
Besides Production, who could've done it?
We're the only people out here.
Aren't we?
♪
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I mean, aren't you still scared?
The spear this morning telling us to leave?
That doesn't scare you at all?
I think, at this point, it's just all mind games.
I miss home.
I miss my family.
I even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend.
This place is-- it's getting to me.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about pushing the button.
I don't want you to go.
You know what I mean?
I think-- I think we can win this.
We just need to--
But I don't need to stay.
I don't understand why I'm even staying.
I don't need the money that badly.
I do.
Annie.
(Sam) I've been a lone wolf for a while, you know?
I've been on my own for a while.
I'm probably, without knowing it, less lonely than I have been in a long time because I'm interacting with people more often than I have in many years.
Now I consider Daniel a friend.
He's a good kid.
If I had a son, I'd be proud if he was like Daniel.
What are you looking at?
- Just watching those two.
- Mm-hmm.
(Daniel) I don't want to overstep my bounds, you know.
I don't know how she feels about me, and so I'm just kind of--
I'm taking it slow, but at the same time, it's really hard 'cause I really want to, you know, see where this is gonna go.
I don't know.
At the same time, I don't want to get hurt.
Don't worry.
She knows you exist.
How would I really get her to?
I don't know, like...
Get her to what?
Like me like me.
You can't get her to like you.
Either she does or she doesn't.
You know?
(Laughs)
How beautiful is it?
This is so nice.
_
Why not?
_
(Laughs)
I'm sorry.
I'm being naughty.
It's beautiful in, though.
_
You must be hot.
Come on.
_
- No good... _
- No one's here.
- It's trouble.
No one's here.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
You want to come.
- Oh, yeah?
_
You'll thank me once you're in here.
It's beautiful.
_
Careful.
_
I'm gonna film us.
_
(Laughs) It's a great idea.
(Laughs)
You promise you'll erase it?
_
- Promise me?
- I promise.
Good.
Annie?
Wait, Annie.
You shouldn't be walking out here alone.
It's not safe.
_
What are you talking about?
Come on, it's not safe.
Stop. Wait.
Don't be like this.
Be like what?
Look, I-- (Sighs)
It's not the same thing for me, okay?
I'm not going back to a life or a job that I like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend, and I get that you're sad about that.
But you're forgetting about who's here for you right now, and you're turning your back on me.
No, I'm not.
(Annie) I like her.
It's been a while since I've been with anybody, but I--
We get along so well.
I just feel like a dumbass now.
I mean, she's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time, if she does stay.
- Hey.
- (Irene) Hey.
- There you are.
- (Irene) How's it going?
Good.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Uh-huh?
Um, so, Victoria's gone.
Um, I'm just wondering what's going on with her bed.
Oh, it's-- well, it's free right now.
So no one would mind if I moved in?
Um... yeah, yeah.
I mean, I don't mind.
I don't know what the other girls other think, but it's good with me.
(Esther) Awesome.
All right, I'll go grab my things.
It's not that I didn't have fun with the boys.
I don't know.
I just feel like my time there is done.
It's served its purpose, and I want to--
I want to get to know the girls a bit better.
- (Miljan) Hey.
- Hey.
- (Miljan) What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
You mean the show?
(Esther) (Laughs) No, you idiot.
I'm gonna move into Victoria's old bed.
Wait.
Why?
Why?
Because it's free.
(Miljan) I know, but I thought you liked it here with me.
You said we are great roommates.
Yes, we were, and thank you for letting me stay.
Just, I don't know.
I want to be with the girls now.
Come on, Esther.
Don't you think we should team up?
(Esther) (Laughs)
We are both smarter than everyone else here.
We can win this thing-- together.
Ohh, I like your style.
I will think about it.
But hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
I was just thinking that we could have something... (Esther) You thought what?
That we could get romantic a little bit?
(Esther) (Laughs)
(Miljan) Don't laugh.
Really?
I don't do romance.
Look, we're playing a game.
(Miljan) What do you mean?
(Esther) I'm playing a game-- for money.
I don't do romance, and I'm not playing a dating game.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you, bitch!
Fuck you, bitch!
You're not going anywhere.
Get the fuck off me!
(Miljan) I'm kidding.
(Laughing) I was just kidding, Esther.
I'm just kidding.
Esther.
(Esther) Don't you fucking touch me again.
(Miljan) Come on! I'm just-
- I was just kidding!
(Esther) I think I was in shock.
I-I don't know.
It happened so quickly.
But he grabbed me here, pushed me up against the bunk, and then he backed off.
(Miljan) Esther is a player.
We all know that.
And I played with her, too.
So she was on the way out.
I just pushed her a little bit on the bed, just jokingly, like pretending that I'm like scaring her.
"You're gonna stay here," or something.
She just, like, freaked out.
She pushed me away.
She's like, "don't talk to me like that."
Stormed out, like mad.
And I was just telling her, "I'm joking.
You know me. I always joke around.
I was just joking with you."
I didn't get it, seriously.
She just freaked out, and it was just a pure joke.
What are you showing me?
It was right here.
(Carolina) Are you sure?
(Neeko) Big huge carcass.
Guts hanging out and everything.
Look.
Look at what?
The blood?
It could've been anything.
It could've been a bird. It could've been a deer.
(Neeko) Why would I make this up?
Why would I lie?
There was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there.
I guess they took it.
The producers took it.
The producers?
I think she thinks that I could've been trying to scare her, play a sick joke on her.
I was kind of a bit shocked because I didn't think she saw me as that kind of person.
For all I know, Johnny took it.
(Carolina) Johnny took it?
He probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something.
I don't know.
(Carolina) Oh, now Johnny does everything?
Not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us, we got to worry about that guy.
Hopefully he's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here.
I don't think he's as bad as you think.
Why are you always defending him?
Why are you always defending him?
I'm telling you that guy's dangerous.
You need to watch yourself!
I'm kind of baffled where it's gone, you know, 'cause this thing was pretty big, you know.
It would've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there, and there was no trail.
There was no kind of like a trail of where it could've been dragged to.
It's like it was almost picked up and gone.
Got some traps set up along this way somewhere.
I found some deer trails I scouted earlier.
Hope they catch something.
The first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome, actually.
Had a nice little fire.
Weather was nice.
You know, wrapped up.
It was nice being on my own.
It's what I wanted to do originally, too, is, you know, be by myself, take care of myself, do my own thing, and I got that, so pretty content.
What the hell did this, man?
This thing's...
I mean, it, obviously, it ripped the deer while it was standing here.
It was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the, like, rip its bone in half.
(Crack)
What do you want?
What are you doing?
(Johnny) I'm trying to catch some food, but something got to it before me, it looks like.
What do you want?
I just came to try to convince you to come back.
(Johnny) Try to convince me to come back, to the camp?
Yeah, I don't think it's safe for you to be out here.
I think it's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don't like me thanks to you, making those wild accusations.
Just, whatever happened, I don't think it's safe for you to stay out here.
Well, you know what?
I really don't need you trying to be nice to me.
I'll be fine on my own, okay?
I can take care of myself.
Y'all try taking care of yourselves, too, all right?
(Carolina) Okay, fine.
If that's how you want to be, then fine.
(Johnny) Fine.
Nah, that's-- that's not good enough.
That ain't good enough.
(Daniel) Hey, Irene.
Hey, Dan.
Whatcha doing?
Collecting some acorns.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
If you mash them up, you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Is it-- does it taste good?
I think so.
You want me to help?
Oh, sure.
That'd be great. Yeah.
They're kind of scattered all over.
Daniel is a really, really nice, really sweet person, and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit,
I guess you can say.
Hey.
It's a Siberian squill.
(Irene) I'm not really big on flowers.
Why not?
Well, you know, they're pretty, but it's kind of odd, the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower 'cause it's like, "Oh, you know, I like you, so let me give you something that's dying."
It never really made sense to me.
(Chuckles)
Something more permanent would be nice, you know, even a rock would be better.
(Daniel) She's got so much complexity to her, you know?
I find out something new about her every day, it seems like, and it's a pretty big thing that I would've never expected out of her.
It's... (Chuckles)
She's just-- she's amazing.
(Both chuckle)
Where are we?
I can't find the path.
We're lost.
- We're not lost.
- No, we're lost.
I don't know where we're going.
(Miljan) In the middle of the wood, very close to the river,
I found this really weird-looking tree.
I mean, it wasn't a tree.
It was something different.
It had a face shape.
It had hair.
What?
My name is Miljan.
It's really nice to meet you. (Chuckles)
What is your name?
Ogdee?
(Laughs)
This is my friend Ogdee.
We go way back, man.
(Laughs)
He's so bad.
I spoke to it.
We had a little conversation.
Ogdee is my old friend from high school.
(Laughs)
I'm kidding.
- (Man) Esther.
Esther.
- What?
(Esther) Hey.
Where have you been?
Out.
Out?
Where do you go all day, anyway?
(Whispering) Okay.
I can't believe you got us so lost.
We're not lost.
Yes, we are.
Where are we?
Do you know where we are?
We're in Siberia.
Not funny.
Oh, God!
What is that?
Did you hear that?
I heard it.
Come on.
There might be something out here.
Come on.
Oh!
Oh, God!
What are you doing out here?
Sorry.
I'm going to get water.
Where are you going?
Home-- where the hell is it?
That way.
Why is she being such a bitch?
Why are you here, by the way, alone?
No reason.
Uh-huh.
That's suspicious.
(Annie) Shut up, Miljan.
(Chuckles)
(Neeko) Guys, have you seen Carolina?
(Sam) No.
She hasn't come back.
You mean she's not back yet?
She's not back.
I have no idea where she is.
I haven't seen her.
You do know she's out there with Johnny?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I know.
Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I should go and look for her.
I don't-- I don't feel comfortable with her with Johnny.
(Sam) Before it gets too late, I think we should.
I'm game, yeah.
(Neeko) - You're gonna come with me?
- Yeah.
(Miljan) Gentlemen.
Where the hell were you?
I was in the woods.
Have you seen Carolina?
(Neeko) She's out there with Johnny.
(Miljan) Oh, she'll be fine, guys.
- Come on.
- Are you serious?
(Miljan) Yes.
They're probably having sex or something.
Oh, you're a funny guy.
Don't be naive. You didn't notice the chemistry they had?
(Neeko) Hey, guys, listen.
I'm gonna look for her.
I don't know about you.
Just sitting here talking.
(Miljan) Hey, it's dark outside.
(Rumbling)
Oh, fuck!
(Neeko) Get on the bed.
Get onto the bed!
The bed?
(Miljan) Oh, my God.
What is this?
The cab started shaking...
Ran outside, and the sky this just this odd color that I've never seen in my life, and I'm thinking it can't be the show doing this because that's way out of their powers and their control.
What is it?
It's like-- it's like the sky's on fire.
What?
It's like the sky's on fire.
(Daniel) The sky went from dark to light, and it looked like it was on fire, just like Victoria said.
If this is all part of the game, it's beyond me at this point.
I don't understand how they could pull it off.
(Sam) I feel like I'm on another planet.
I feel like I walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare, and nobody-- nobody has any answers.
I don't have an answer.
I could sit here all day long and just-- it's way above my pay scale.
- Is it moving?
- It just keeps moving.
Carolina never came back today, did she?
(Woman) Yeah.
Where-- where are they?
(Miljan) She's still in the woods-- the forest.
Well, this can't stop us.
We still have to find her.
We can't leave her out there.
We better go now.
We're just gonna go look for her-- me and Sam, Daniel, Miljan as well.
Oh, my God.
Carolina?
Carolina.
Are you okay?
(Indistinct shouting)
(Woman) What happened?
Oh, my God.
Carolina!
- What happened?
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
Then we see Carolina stumbling towards the girls' cabin, and the girls go rushing over to her.
Are you hurt somewhere?
- (Sam) What happened?
- (Woman) Look at all the blood.
What happened?
She's bleeding.
Guys, don't, don't-- don't go to her.
Oh, my God, look at her arm.
Look at her arm.
(Sam) What happened to you?
You're okay.
(Neeko) Carolina, what happened?
(Daniel) Carolina shows up, and she's battered and disoriented.
She couldn't even speak.
She's trembling.
(Carolina) I don't...
She doesn't remember.
- (Woman) You don't remember? - (Carolina cries)
(Sam) What do you remember?
(Natalie) She didn't know what was going on.
She was saying she couldn't even, like, remember what she'd been doing out there.
She was just talking nonsense, and it was really jolting to see her come back like that.
_
(Woman) You were with John?
- (Sam) And what happened?
- (Woman) Where is he?
What were you doing with Johnny?
Get her some water.
Get her some help.
(Neeko) Carolina, were you with Johnny?
(Sam) She said she was.
What were you doing with Johnny?
(Neeko) She said the name "Johnny."
At that point, I just, you know, lost it.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
(Neeko) For what?
Here, just come here.
Come here.
I want to say something to you.
- What?
- Listen to me!
It's important.
You got to make sure.
You look at his hands.
(Neeko) Okay.
His hands are a tell-tale sign, okay?
His hands will tell you if he did something.
(Daniel) What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Stay here with the girls.
Stay here with the girls!
(Neeko) I'm not wasting any more time with this guy.
Everyone wants to keep him around, thinking,
"Oh, yeah, he'll turn around and be a good guy."
No, I don't think so.
I'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back.
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.
We're gonna look after you, okay?
Don't worry.
(Esther) We don't know where Johnny is.
Carolina sort of-- she couldn't say much, but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and Johnny were fighting.
And then, now she looks like this, so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him.
Let's just keep moving.
(Rustling)
Move.
Move.
_
(Rustling continues)
The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that, you know--
We stop and we look, and there's nothing there.
It's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you're being watched, you know.
Whether, you know, whether you're in the woods or in the cabin, you always feel like something is watching you, and the past two nights,
I haven't slept very well, you know.
So I'm just-- you know, you're always looking over your shoulder.
You always think something's there, and, like, the whole thing with the sky now...
I don't know.
(Animal screeches)
Well, he's obviously around here somewhere.
(Rustling)
Yes.
You keep saying "he," "he."
Look how thick the brush is here.
If there's somebody around here, we'd see them.
We hear other things.
All of a sudden, something goes flying.
I think we should be talking more in the sense of "what."
I'll go see if the water's boiled.
Thank you.
(Natalie) I don't want to die.
I didn't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show, and every day that I'm here,
I feel like I'm an idiot for staying, that I am gonna end up like Tommy.
(Cries)
I don't deal well with-- Abuse is not something that...
I can handle right now.
I'm scared.
(Daniel) And Johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food.
I just-- How could he do that to her?
It didn't make sense.
She's such a nice lady.
(Footsteps)
Johnny.
Hey.
What did you do?
- Huh?
- What did you do to Carolina?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?
- What'd you do to her?
- I didn't--
She's all cut up and shit.
I don't-
- I don't know.
I...
What's wrong with you?
I don't know. I just-
- I kind of came to.
I was walking around, and...
I don't know.
I was- - I saw her.
You saw her where?
You got to tell me what happened.
We were in the woods, and...
I don't really-- I don't really remember.
I get approached by Daniel, and basically started accusing me of hurting Carolina.
I didn't know what to say.
(Natalie) What did you to do her? !
The last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you, so you can't come back here and tell me that you didn't touch her!
I don't.
(Natalie) Then what happened to her?
I don't know.
That's not a very good answer right now, man.
I don't-- trust me.
That's not a very good answer.
(Indistinct shouting in distance)
Hey.
You hear that?
At the camp.
Let's go.
I don't know.
Are you serious?
You don't know?
You're such a scumbag.
Oh, what?
So she just fell down and ended up that way?
Are you kidding me?
I was in a complete haze.
I had no recollection.
I was like blacked out, like I drank too much.
(Daniel) He doesn't look like he knows what's going on.
(Johnny) I don't.
- Then what happened to her?
- (Johnny) I don't know.
I don't know.
(Woman) You were together, weren't you?
- You said that.
- Shit!
Neeko!
Neeko!
(Indistinct shouting)
(Daniel) Guys, he doesn't know!
(Neeko)
- Motherfucker!
(Daniel)
- Come on!
Stop it!
- (Carolina) Stop!
Stop it!
- (Neeko) Come on!
Stop it!
Neeko, stop it!
He didn't do it!
Carolina starts screaming, "It's not him.
He didn't do it."
Stop it!
What do you mean?
You said you don't remember.
You said you don't remember.
(Neeko) You're a dead man.
You're a fucking dead man.
(Daniel) Listen.
Listen.
Hey, hey.
Hey!
Calm down.
Listen.
- What happened?
- (Johnny) I don't know.
Talk to me.
I don't know.
Johnny doesn't know anything?
He doesn't remember anything.
It was just her and him in the forest.
I know that.
I know that.
I saw it in his eyes, okay?
All I remember is I talked to her.
We were arguing.
And then I-I came here, and I started getting accused, and I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
(Sam) If we caught him in the woods, he would've been dead.
When I saw that look in his eyes,
I just felt that I needed to take a step back.
Remember the way she came into camp?
He's got the same look on his face.
(Johnny) Does she remember anything?
(Woman) Show us your hands.
(Woman) (Gasps)
(Natalie) Oh, yeah.
I've seen that before.
(Woman) What's that from?
(Sam) Nothing's making sense here.
And just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
We can't go killing each other.
We're still human beings.
(Hiss)
(Talking indistinctly)
(Birds chirping)
I don't like things that I can't explain and that I don't have at least some sort of control over.
The sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers, the show can't do that.
We're talking supernatural stuff now.
Regardless of everything else, that's real, and that scared the hell out of me.
(Johnny) It seems like everybody at camp was convinced that I was the person that hurt her.
I've never hit a woman in my life.
I don't know why I would.
I don't remember anything, but...
I can't say that I didn't 'cause I don't--
I don't know what happened.
But I know in my heart I wouldn't do that.
(Carolina) I don't remember anything.
All I remember is that I was... with--
Went to get Johnny.
He was in the woods.
I found him, and I...
It's all one big blur, like one big blackout.
I have all these marks on my body, and my shirt is broken, and I don't remember.
I don't understand.
So you're telling me this is real.
(Sabina) Yes.
It looks like it's native, handmade.
It looks like it's just a prop to me.
Well, if it's a prop, it's really well-made 'cause you see the barbs.
They're curved.
That's exactly how it should look.
This is ox.
It's real ox.
And it's balanced for throwing.
It just looks perfect.
It's your choice to believe in it or not, but this is real, so...
I don't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true, what is not.
I have to know the environment I'm in.
I have to know what's out there in order to protect myself and survive.
Look at this.
So, I found this symbol that is really strange.
It has four lines and little triangles on the ends.
Then I found another one and another one, and I realized it's a path.
I should follow them.
At the end, it was very close to the settlement.
I found the last one.
And I found this box.
It was a metal box.
I opened it, and it was a book.
I didn't understand anything because it was in a different language.
I would assume it's Russian because it's cyrillic letters.
(Miljan) In the middle of me looking at it, somebody was watching at me.
It was a person.
He's staring at me.
And he just disappeared in a second.
So there are people out there.
Hey.
I was just gonna try and make things better, and, like, apologize, and just wanted to let her know that I didn't, you know,
I didn't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her.
I guess I was in a weird mood, and I just want to apologize because I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, because I'm really glad you're--
(Natalie) When I realized what Annie's real feelings were for me,
I just thought...
"I'm sort of open to love in any form right now."
So I kissed her.
(Chuckles)
Which I kind of surprised myself at, to be honest.
(Laughs)
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I have a seat?
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.
You?
I wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing 'cause I knew she had scratches and stuff on her, and she was sure freaked out like I was.
(Carolina) Do you remember anything from last night?
No.
I don't remember a thing.
I don't remember anything either.
But I know you didn't hurt me.
I would never hurt you.

(Johnny) Can I ask you something, though?
Why'd you set me up?
With the shed and the food?
She couldn't even look me in the eye.
And I was like, "Well..."
I was like, "It tells me all I need to know,"
so I was like-- got the hell out of there.
Johnny.
Johnny.
(Spanish) Stop, please.
Johnny, wait for me.
- Give me a break. (Spanish) Oh, my God. - (Daniel) Hey.
I know that.
I know that.
- Johnny.
- I know that.
You're an actress.
She said, like, this slogan.
Like, "I know that.
I know that from somewhere."
And then it just-- the light bulb went off.
Yeah, that's like your slogan.
She's that actress from that show that--
I'm like, "That's how I know you."
I didn't want to do that.
I didn't want-
- I asked them.
You didn't want to do what?
I didn't want to burn it down.
I didn't want to set you up.
They told me to.
Who's they?
The producers.
So you're-- you're helping the show?
- Mom, may I please go to the toilet?
David!
It's me.
Olivier! What are you doing here?
You thought you were going to America without me?
You're coming with us?
Wow! I'm so happy!
- But how can we do it?
- Don't worry, I planned everything.
I have my health card.
I even pinched some money from Jean and Elodie... for the train.
See, I still have some left.
You can't pay the boat fare with that.
I'll try to get hired as a cabin boy, or a dishwasher.
Or hide with you as a stowaway.
I saw that in a movie.
I'll feed you.
In America, Samuel will help me cross the border.
Now that you're an orphan, my parents could adopt you.
Oh yeah!
That would be swell.
We'd be brothers!
Come on.
Let's go see my parents.
Wouldn't it be better to meet on the boat?
But no. They'll be really happy to see you.
They were awfully worried.
Isaac!
Olivier!
What are you doing here?
Is Elodie with you?
No. She doesn't know I'm coming with you.
Coming with us?
Now what is this all about?
We could take him to America.
But these children are utterly out of their minds!
Olivier, we would gladly take you if we could, but we're not your parents.
We can adopt him!
David, look.
We can't just adopt someone.
And then, Olivier has a family, an aunt who has the means to give him a good education.
I don't want to go to Aunt Victoria's.
She's a cow! Listen.
Once we get to Havre, I'll call Elodie.
I'll buy a ticket for your return, and she'll come... pick you up at the Saint-Lazare station.
I can't!
I pinched money from her to take the train.
No.
It's okay.
I will explain... and she'll understand.
If he can't come with us, then I'm staying with him.
Isaac, tell them it's not possible!
Listen, Olivier...
We understand your sorrow but please, be reasonable.
No. It's not true.
You understand nothing!
You only think of yourself!
No, Olivier.
Olivier, wait for me!
I'm coming with you!
David, come back!
Hurry David, hurry up!
Children, come back!
Ouch!
My leg!
- I got one. - Olivier!
It wasn't my son who pulled the alarm.
It was a friend who wanted to come with us.
He's all alone. You must find him!
- Come here, David.
- I'll see what I can do.
I don't want to go with you.
David!
Come back, kid.
What happened?
A kid pulled the alarm.
He ran away.
You should put a flare on the track for the next train.
We don't have time.
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
David!
David!
David.
- Where are you're going, boy?
Paris?
That's pretty far off!
I had planned to take the train.
I'm going to Paris as well. I'll take you.
Besides, I don't like traveling alone, so we'll be doing each other a favor.
Agreed?
Anyone in the back?
No. I'm going back empty.
- So, okay.
- Where in Paris do you live?
I'm not from Paris, I'm from the Hill.
A real urchin, hey.
Your parents just let you go?
Yeah.
My parents are really cool.
They trust me.
Okay.
Get in.
- So?
- So....so...
Zilch.
Nothing.
The police have issued an APB.
Zober was the last to see him.
Since then, not a trace.
And that's not all!
They want to fine him for pulling the alarm.
And for the money he's stolen?
- Did you tell them?
- No.
I'm waiting for them to find him.
I hope he didn't do anything stupid.
Him? What do you think!
Just wait. He'll get what's coming to him.
I want him out of here.
He's a sack of shit!
- Listen.
- I don't want to hear it!
I'll kick his ass straight to the reformatory!
Anybody here?
What is it?
What do you want, lad?
I'd like to talk to Mr. Privat.
He should be here.
No. He's at home now, in Auvergne.
Can I call him?
My mother often called him from here.
So you are the son of Mrs. Châteauneuf?
Everyone is looking for you, even the police.
- I beg you.
I must talk to him.
It's important.
I'll call.
Good evening, miss.
Could you ring Number 3 at Saugues, please.
It's in Haute-Loire.
You won't tell the cops, eh?
Hello?
Mr. Privat?
Excuse me. This is Hotel Du Cantal.
I have Mrs. Châteauneuf's son here.
He wants to talk to you.
I'll put him on.
Hello.
Mr. Privat?
Yes, this is Olivier.
You must help me. I did something stupid.
I ran away and stole money from Elodie.
I'm really scared.
Yes.
Yes, okay.
Thank you.
I'll put him on.
Hello, Mr. Privat?
Yes.
Good.
See you tomorrow morning.
Come with me.
You'll sleep here.
Olivier!
Olivier!
Hello!
Wake up.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
This breakfast should give you a boost.
Thank you.
But first... I must tell you what happened.
Don't worry.
I know all about it.
Everything's been sorted out.
I've already been to the police station and have spoken to Elodie.
She's waiting for you.
- She's glad you're in good health.
- She won't send me to reform school?
Nothing of the sort.
Everyone knows what you're going through right now.
Elodie even has a surprise for you.
Come on, eat up.
Then we'll go see her.
Okay, sir.
This is so good!
I'm coming!
Olivier, I'm so glad to see you.
You're okay?
- You're not too tired?
- No, no.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Elodie... I wanted to apologize.
For the money and for the scare I've given you.
You know, we all make mistakes.
It wasn't too serious.
And we understand you.
Without your mom, and also with David's departure...
This is why mister Privat and we decided to make you a big surprise.
What is it?
You'll go with him to Saugues.
You'll see, there you'll be very, very happy.
You'll have a big bedroom all to yourself.
You'll learn to ride a horse.
And then the mountain air, there's nothing better for a child!
And I don't live far from your grandparents.
You can see them when you want.
And there's also a very good school.
Your studies will be better there.
What does Aunt Victoria say?
She wouldn't let me see you!
Who does she think she is?
It's none of her business.
Well, don't stand there.
Sit down, Mr. Privat.
After all, it was your mother's idea, to go with Mr. Privat.
If you want to, of course.
When's that gonna be?
Well, today.
You see, I finished packing your suitcase.
So you can catch the 2 PM train.
You'll see, you'll be better off there than here.
- Why so fast?
- Aunt Victoria could make trouble.
Trouble?
Yes. By law I don't have the right to take you.
I'll have a lawyer if necessary.
I'll say that it was your mother's wish and yours as well.
Don't you worry Olivier.
You'd only get miserable here.
There are too many memories.
I wonder if I have time to say goodbye to Mado.
You and your Mado, I tell you!
Better hurry, you don't want to miss the 2 PM train.
Get on with it.
Olivier!
I'm so happy to see you.
You gave us such a scare!
When did you get back?
This morning.
- Well, come in!
- No, no.
I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yes.
I'm going to Auvergne with a friend of my mother's.
It may be the best for you.
Olivier!
- Hurry up!
- Yes.
I'm coming!
I'll have to go.
By the way...
I just wanted to tell you that...
I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, Olivier.
- Don't forget to write me!
- Yes, Mado.
Hey, artilleryman!
Hitting the road without saying goodbye?
Yeah. I'm going to Auvergne.
Give my regards to the volcanoes!
- Okay.
- Right, shall we go?
Where you're going with that suitcase?
Well, I'm leaving.
- For long?
- I don't know.
Maybe for good.
Don't forget me too fast, okay?
Come on, Oliver.
Come.
Olivier!
Olivier.
I made you some pancakes.
I know you like them so much.
You can eat them on the train.
You were always so sweet.
Don't change too much over there.
Okay, I'll leave you here because... farewells makes me too sad.
Olivier, it's for your own good, you know that don't you?
Come on, give me a kiss.
Now don't you worry.
I'll see you soon.
- Thank you, Mr. Privat.
- Goodbye. Let's go.
I say, you're a real celebrity around here.
Have you ever been to Saugues, before the funeral?
No, sir. Never.
Call me André.
Gare d'Orsay.
Get in.
No. I can't.
I can't.
What's the matter?
I can't leave my street.
It's not because of you, but I want to stay here.
- Why did you call me, then?
I thought... - I know.
It's my fault.
But I don't want to leave my street.
I don't want to leave Bougras, Mado,
Capdeverre, Loulou...
I don't even want to leave I'Araignée.
Don't worry, Olivier.
I understand completely.
We will do what you want.
Anyway, think about it.
If you need me, write me.
Well, goodbye.
Olivier!
What's going on?
Where is Mr. Privat?
Well, he took a taxi.
How so?
Without you?
I didn't want to leave.
What? Are you crazy?
Everything was arranged!
I don't want to leave my street.
I don't want to leave my friends.
And you, of course.
You think you're gonna stay with us?
We can't afford it, you know that!
If that's the way it's going to be, I'll inform Aunt Victoria.
And the family council will have to decide.
Henri, I'm counting on you.
You will be firm.
As usual, my dear.
Wow, check out this tin can!
Can you believe this?
It's slick.
- Really snazzy!
- Hey, get away from there!
Here we are!
- Hello, Henri.
- Hello, Jean.
Ah, here's our little adventurer.
- Hello, Elodie.
- Hello.
You'll be able to brag about the awful fright you gave us.
Oh yes!
You can say that again!
- Hello.
- Hello.
As you know, the haberdashery has been sold.
I gathered for you some of your mother's things, Olivier.
There are some personal items, souvenirs, photos of your father, - and several school notebooks.
- Thanks, aunt.
It's only natural, Olivier.
Your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will receive.
Say uncle, what is a guardian?
It means I am responsible for you.
- As if you were my father?
- Yes, something like that.
Come one, sort these out in your room.
What's a family council?
Well, the family gathers to determine what is best for your future.
Why can't I listen to what's being said?
Because that's the way it is.
Go, please leave us.
Take it.
Go.
Please, let's sit down and talk.
What do you plan on doing with him?
Us, what do you mean?
It's up to you to take him. You're his aunt.
I'm only his cousin, and a distant one at that.
Come on. I'm sure we can find a solution together.
One obviously comes to mind.
Yes. The orphanage.
That might be a little harsh.
We had something else in mind.
If we wanted to honor Virginie's wishes, it would be up to M. Privat to take care of him.
I've said it before and I'll say it again:
- It is out of the question.
He's an ex-convict, remember that.
What would the people say in Saugues?
What would they think of us?
Besides, the kid doesn't want that.
How would you know?
I suppose I can tell you, now.
On the day he returned from his fugue, he called Privat at his estate.
I thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him.
Unfortunately, at the last minute, he decided he wanted to stay with us.
If I understand correctly, you decided this without our knowing.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
It would have suited everyone.
I'm not of that opinion.
But, since you deemed it unnecessary to consult me, it's because you don't recognize my right.
It's up to you to take care of him.
Besides, his world is here.
In our milieu, he would be all confused.
That's it, Victoria.
You're too good for your brother's son.
I didn't say that.
No need to be so offensive.
Unquestionably, you can't deny... that Olivier has spent all of his life on this street.
His school and his friends are here.
Besides, at this moment, with my son coming down with tuberculosis, have you thought of the risk of contagion?
Yes, of course I have.
How are we going to feed him?
- We're already struggling.
- And this apartment is too small.
I could help you.
Temporarily, of course.
Well in that case, maybe we could keep him.
We would need...
I don't know... 150 francs a month.
- What? Half of that would be plenty.
That just wouldn't be enough.
But we will make an effort until the end of the school year.
After that, we won't be able to.
You do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon.
Elodie, you've been chanting that for the last 2 years.
How can you say that, Victoria!
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- That's too easy! Jean, tell her to get out of here!
Now, now, precious, Victoria has apologized.
Implying that we're only good at making babes with tuberculosis, that takes the cake!
I will not stay here one second longer.
- Let's go, Henri.
- No. Wait for me in the car.
What a mess!
Especially since we agreed to a settlement.
Henri, I would think that with 115... okay, let's say 110, we could make ends meet. Come now, let's not negotiate again.
Our proposition stands at 100.
If that doesn't work out, we can always discuss it further.
- So let's start with 100.
- Here is the first month's.
- Goodbye, Henri.
- Yes, goodbye.
Elodie.
Elodie, open the door, please.
Ah, you!
You could have taken my side at least!
They were ready to give us 100 francs. I wasn't going to mess with that.
Lucky for us, I patched things up!
You call that patching things up?
You know it won't be enough.
I told you, we need at least 130 Franc.
If I work for the rest, maybe I can stay?
You know the answer is yes.
You're eavesdropping.
But not for long. But why?
Because you're a pain, that's why.
All you care about is whether you can stay or not!
Look at you.
You're yelling at the kid, yet in front of Victoria, you can't grow a pair!
You... looks like you're courting back luck.
I got it, I got it!
"Dear David,
"It's been 6 weeks to this day since your departure.
"I have no news from you, which means you're probably busy,
"as well as your parents."
Hey, Olivier, you coming?
We've made our own wading pool.
Now, let me give you some advice.
Come play with us instead of wasting ink...
- on a guy who'll never answer you.
- Would you leave me alone, Loulou?
Come on, Loulou!
I'm coming!
Glazier!
Glazier!
So, artilleryman, you still here?
Why the sad face?
David is gone.
I have no news of him.
I can't stay with my cousins.
I would have to somewhat earn my keep.
You could always help me with my chores, right?
You'll see, earning your keep isn't that hard.
And if you ask me, you shouldn't waste your time like this, staring for hours at your mother's old boutique.
That won't bring her back, you know.
I know it's not fair.
And with your best friend gone.
You feel abandoned.
But friends... you still have quite a few around here.
And you'll make new ones.
See, look at your buddies.
You have to open up, Olivier.
You understand?
Come on, Olive!
No bad feelings!
Go on, go!
Come on, we're having a splash!
Hurry up, for God's sake!
Aren't you done yet wasting this water... with your stupid games?
- Bunch of gutter-puppies!
- We're doing nothing wrong.
"Nothing wrong"?
What if there's a fire, where would the water come from?
Come on, Mr. Gastounet, have you never been young? Children should have fun.
What right have you, madame?
I have no lessons to learn from a....from a hooker.
Are you afraid you might get hooked, Mr. Gastounet?
I think I could teach you a few things.
Let's stop there.
I have nothing to say to you.
You started it, old fart.
She really nailed you, Gastounet!
You anarchist, I have nothing to say to you.
And you? Who do you think you are, you old Grinch.
We're not about to stop the children from having fun!
Taking the moral high ground instead of sweeping his own porch.
What a sourpuss!
- How's the work coming downstairs?
- Very well, very well.
- Bougras says we'll be done by 5.
- Good.
That's very good.
Here you go, two cheese sandwiches.
Enjoy. Thank you very much.
Ah... there's I'Araignée.
Thanks.
Good day, sir, you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
The Salvation Army and Soup Kitchen close in the spring.
I'm hungry. Artilleryman!
Where are my sandwiches?
Coming, coming!
Good Lord, a nice shot of red and a cheese sandwich.
the only 2 things worth living for!
Hey, hey...easy there little feller.
I offer for the taste, not to guzzle.
If you're thirsty, drink water.
Would you like a fag, Monsieur Bougras?
Ernest gave them to me.
Oh no. Bougras, he always sticks to the pipe.
Say, monsieur Bougras...
Why do you have a beard?
It's to hide the ugly mug underneath!
Now then, back to work!
Look here, I think you're filling them up too much.
You trying to get me sloshed?
- See you, Ernest.
- See you!
Well, my cellar rats?
Mission accomplished, boss!
But there are 3 bottles that are a bit cloudy.
That's normal, it's the bottom of the barrel.
You can have them.
Not a bad lot, but I can't sell them.
- Good. Now, we agreed on 25 Franc?
- Yes, that's it.
- Here, then.
- Thanks.
Here, this is for you.
Ten francs?
But it's too much, Mr.Bougras.
Didn't you say you needed extra dough to help your cousin?
And to top it off, here's an eggplant for suppertime.
Here.
- But why?
- It's not for your work,
I owed your mother money, but I forgot.
You can check the ledgers, it's all in writing.
In that case, thanks!
That should help with your keep.
Your cousin will probably want you to stay, now.
- What can I get you?
- Anything you want, except red.
Nothing for me, I have errands.
- So long, Ernest.
So long, Bougras.
- So long, kid! - How about white wine?
- Can't say no to that.
That must be him!
You know how late you are?
Where were you?
- We started without you.
- Forgive me, Elodie.
- Good Lord, you're reeking of wine!
- And what's this?
A leg of veal!
Leg of veal?
- You didn't steal it I hope?
- No. No. I've been working with Bougras at the Transatlantique.
In that case, that's really nice of you.
I even brought you some wine, Jean.
Beaujolpif?
Let's have a swig!
- Would you like a bit?
- Sure I would.
- So, how is it?
- Not bad, not bad.
Excellent, yeah!
See? He's not a bad kid, after all.
We would keep you if we were rich, you know.
No worries. I could stop going to school.
I could scrounge a bit more with Bougras.
I would earn more money and help you out.
Don't be stupid, Olivier!
You think your mom would approve of you turning into a street urchin?
You don't want to go to school, anymore?
End up as a drop-out like Bougras?
If I could have stayed longer in school, we wouldn't be here today.
He's right. You're lucky to have your Aunt Victoria.
- We're too young.
- And you don't want me around.
That's not true.
Don't say that..
But taking care of you is a sacrifice.
If he had to work, people would say we're exploiting him.
His Aunt should take him in.
No! You also said she's a cow.
We'll talk about that later.
For now, you'll still go to school.
Alright, Jean.
May I have some more?
You certainly have an appetite this evening.
I'm flattered.
Here you go!
Thanks, Elodie.
Look at this scoundrel.
No wonder his plate emptied so fast!
Show me your napkin.
It's for a kitten.
A kitten?
You think we're stupid?
No, I swear it!
A kitten eating potatoes?
That'll be the day!
Come on, give it to me.
No, wait!
Don't throw it out!
Why not?
You'll see.
Go ahead, put it in.
That way, we'll have an hour or two to ourselves.
Yes, you're right.
Here you go, Olivier.
Go feed that kitten of yours.
- Thanks, Jean.
- Alright, scram.
We'll leave a key under the mat.
And you turn off the light.
Very well.
See you tomorrow, Elodie!
- No funny stuff, okay?
- Don't worry.
Your vest!
Thanks.
Elodie...
I think we're too soft on him.
The longer he stays the more he gets attached.
You think I'm not getting attached?
What are you doing here?
Thanks, kid.
Smells good!
It was better when it was hot.
It's veal with potatoes.
Good, huh?
Delicious.
I'll eat it later.
I also have a fag.
I'm in heaven!
That's swell!
I have something for you.
It's an anthology on the language of flowers.
I didn't know flowers could talk.
Not on their own, of course.
If a man offers one to a woman, it speaks without making a sound.
Each flower has its own meaning.
That is the language of flowers.
Hey, Olivier, want to join me?
I'm going to the basilica to see the night over Paris.
I can't go.
Don't you see I'm chatting with my buddy?
Your loss.
Girls....
They're such leeches.
You won't always think that.
Given that a laborer earns 35 Franc per day, and works 48 weeks of 5 and half days each year, what could he set aside at the end of the year?
A few beans, monsieur!
Châteauneuf, bring to me whatever you are reading.
The Language of Flowers?
We have a poet in our midst.
Let's see if you've at least learned something.
What is, according to this leaflet, the meaning of... the oak-leaf geranium?
It symbolizes true friendship.
That is correct.
The white Japanese camellia?
Perfect beauty.
- And the acacia?
- Elegance, monsieur.
You see, if you want, you'd get better grades!
Yes. Yes.
- Hello, Mado.
- Hello, Olivier.
For me?
Oh, you shouldn't have!
They are magnificent.
They didn't cost me anything.
I went to the opening of Les Halles with Bougras.
We gave a hand to a flower merchant.
Red roses.
You know what it means when a man offers red roses to a woman?
No, not at all.
It's a statement of passionate love.
Oh yeah?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Oh yeah! I love tea, now.
Here.
Take it.
Tell me, any news from your friend David?
No.
And I wrote him so many letters.
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get one soon.
I don't care anymore.
I'll make new friends.
That I am sure of.
Now.
I must get dressed.
You stay here and finish your tea.
I just step into the other room.
I'm keeping warm all over, my little heart is as white as a toad's underbelly.
Worries, I have but a few.
Troubles, I couldn't care less.
What's gotten over you?
I got promoted to film editor at Pathé cinema.
Really? That's swell!
You bet your ass!
I'm starting on the newsreels, and after that I can work... my way up to the big movies.
That dress I saw in the Galeries, maybe we can afford it, now?
Elodie, I can see it right now over your shoulders.
And the tandem.
We'll get the bike too. For our Sunday outings!
Oh yeah!
Say!
Maybe you can keep me now?
If I have the means, Olivier.
If I have the means.
You know, Elodie is pregnant.
Can you imagine?
A baby and you in this tiny apartment?
You're expecting a baby?
Well, yes.
That's neat!
When is it due?
Well, in 5 months.
You see, it still gives you some time.
Anyway, I'm really happy for you.
I forgot, Olivier!
You must hurry.
Mr. Privat came to see you.
Mr. Privat?
He's in Paris?
Yes, just a stopover.
He's waiting for you at the Marcadet Palace to see a movie.
So go!
You gotta hurry.
Don't forget your vest!
When our teacher talks about the war, he never mentions any of this.
Is that how it really was?
Far worse.
It was a slaughterhouse.
I shouldn't have brought you to see this.
For a child, it's too sad.
I remember a time.
Papa would always say: "That fucking war".
What was my dad like?
I've told you already.
You father and I were friends long before the war.
He was injured during the assault on the Marne.
He wrote me saying they had captured lots of German soldiers... completely drunk from guzzling too much champagne.
Ours!
Our champagne!
He got hurt two days later, during a counter- strike.
Your dad was right:
"Fucking war!"
My mom would always answer him... that it was thanks to the war they got married.
Father was wounded and mother was the nurse, and that's how it all started.
It's a beautiful story.
Yes, Olivier.
It's a beautiful story.
Come on.
There's Bougras!
He's a sandwich man, now?
Playbill?
One for you.
Get your playbill right here.
He's my buddy.
I'll introduce you.
Hey, hey, my artilleryman, on vacation I see?
Enjoying the flick?
Good day, monsieur Bougras.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Privat. He was my mother's best friend.
We just saw The Wooden Crosses.
It was well done.
In terms of bloodbaths, this one was well done, yes.
You got nothing better to do than take him to a war film?
You shouldn't say that.
Mr. Privat is a hero.
You're nuts if you think that!
As if there were heroes in a war.
In a war there're only victims and assassins.
How many Krauts did he kill?
Ten?
Twenty? Fifty?
That's it?
And today, we proudly sport medals!
What you really want is that he admires you.
Wasn't it enough to lose an arm?
Would it please you, if he also goes to war.
No, sir.
You're wrong.
I wish he will never have to.
That's what we fought for.
Yeah, yeah, la-Dee-da, la-Dee-la!
Yeah, I've heard it before.
I know the tune.
You'd better take him to Luna Park instead, to see Charlie Chaplin.
It would be funnier.
Ah, what the fuck.
You make me sick.
- See you later, mates!
- Wait...
Bougras...
As for you, don't bother me.
You're a twit, just like the others.
I don't ever want to see you.
Good morning, monsieur Bougras.
Something wrong, Olivier?
No, I'm fine.
It's just that Mr. Bougras doesn't want to see me anymore.
Ah, I wouldn't worry about it.
He's a bit like me.
Sometimes, we get angry at the whole world.
It comes and goes.
- Want to do something for me?
- Yes, what?
A shelf came down in my room.
No sweat. After school, I'll fix it impeccable.
- See you later.
- See you later.
There.
Just like new.
Thank you, Olivier.
Here, could you place this on the shelf?
Sure.
Oh, darn!
"The Terrible Fall of Daniel."
"Daniel, King of the trapeze."
"The terrible fall.
Last night in Paris, during his performance...
"at the winter circus, the famous trapeze artist Daniel...
"fell 12 m to the ground."
"Daniel's terrible accident."
"Unbelievable but true:
Daniel still the best."
Do you know this Daniel?
He's a buddy of yours?
It was you?
You were flying the trapeze?
Here, that was you?
If you don't mind, this stays between us.
But why?
Out of vanity.
You see, I still rather inspire fear than pity.
Oh my, you sure have a lot of books!
Oh, once I had many more.
I sold nearly all of them.
Everyone has to eat.
What a shame.
I've become attached to this neighbourhood, to this street.
I wouldn't want to leave it and wind up in an old people's home, even if I was better off, given my condition.
I understand you.
I don't want to leave either.
And why would you?
Jean and Elodie will soon have a baby.
When the baby is born, they won't be able to keep me.
There might a way.
Look, behind the cupboard. That's your cousin's place.
So that means I sleep right over there.
I say, that is funny!
Here, I'd like to give you a book.
Not just any book, mind you.
It's a bit thick, but once you've read it, life and books will no longer hold secrets for you.
Pretty heavy, hey?
It's the weight of knowledge.
"Amouillante,
"noun, feminine and adjective:
"cow ready to calve.
"Amor,
"Latin word meaning love:
"physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another,"
"Physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another."
Capdeverre.
Five. And I went easy on you.
You obviously want to be a boxer, but it looks like... you forgot to take your gloves off before starting your essay.
Loulou.
Zero.
Not a bad piece, even funny at times.
However, gangster is not a profession.
If your ideals only tend toward dough, shooters and broads, you'll hit the slammer faster than a jackrabbit.
Châteauneuf.
Why did your write your essay in verse?
I don't know, it's more beautiful!
"He who pushes his talents accomplishes nothing with grace", my child.
Anyway, I do see the effort.
And in terms of vocabulary, you went the extra mile.
However... I do ask myself, why do all of your aspirations start with the letter A?
You contemplate becoming an: acrobat, architect, administrator, athlete, armorer, aviator, ambassador, astrologer, anthropologist... and artistic lyricist.
Careful not to spread yourself too thin.
I gave you an 8.
It's a little harsh, but see it as an encouragement.
Ernest.
I would have liked to see you become as imaginative.
You'd like to be a coffee-shop owner, like papa.
Excuse me, Mr. Gastounet.
Children, our country is facing hard times.
President Doumer was shot down at noon today by a madman.
His situation is hopeless.
Consequently, you will all go home to your parents.
And tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mourning.
- Yeah!
All this will finish badly, very badly...
And so, in this edition, we'll follow the funeral of President Paul Doumer... and the results of the legislative elections, and also the leftist swing in Parliament.
So... for Doumer's funeral, we went all out.
We have 7 cameras.
One at the entrance and exit of the Elysée, and all along the procession route in Paris.
This way, we'll have a good assessment of the crowd: tens of thousands of mourners.
The assassin:
Goryoulov.
It's the only record we have.
We have no footage.
And we'll end with the elections.
It's familiar ground, but at least we'll give out some results.
The Left wins 91 seats.
Lights!
That's good.
It's good, but I want everything... you've got on the assassination and funeral of Doumer.
Nobody cares about the elections.
Especially since your footage is as dull as dishwater.
Yes, you're right.
Sir, although the footage of Doumer's funeral is powerful, the real important event are the elections.
For the first time in many years, the left regained a majority!
Young man, the people want to see something spectacular.
The face of Charles Lindbergh when told about the death of his son, or the skater Sonia Hènie, or Doumer on his death bed; not what they read about 3 days before.
Agreed. But we can't downplay the upsurge by the left.
First of all, the left is not yet the ruling party.
Second, learn to mind your own business.
Oh, but it is my business!
I'm a citizen just like you.
Alright. We'll see about that later.
You should have seen the way I nailed the producer today!
He didn't even want to talk about the elections!
Aren't you're not pushing your luck?
You just started there. I know you with your big mouth!
Oh, don't get me started!
What do you call this?
- It's a surprise.
- Really?
Who made this hole in the wall?
Don't worry.
The landlord made it.
Oh yeah?
What for? Well, when the neighbour moved out, I told the landlord we needed more space for the baby.
- He had to study the wall's integrity.
- Did he say yes?
Yes. He'll come to talk about raising the rent.
That would be fantastic!
We wouldn't have to move to a larger flat.
Right.
L'Araignée used to live here.
Yes. This morning, he was taken to the old people's home.
He asked to be taken.
He found it harder to get up the stairs.
We won't see him anymore?
Well, one man's loss is another man's gain.
Listen, before checking out, he left some books for you.
Have a look.
- May I say something?
- Go ahead.
With this room, if I sleep here... I'll be less of a burden.
We want this to be the baby's room.
I know, but in the meantime.
You, when your mind is set on something...
Alright, then.
Until the baby is born, you can squat.
- Yeah!
- And tomorrow, I'll take you to the studio. You'll work all day as an extra on a movie set.
Look at that.
- What a beauty!
- It's a Delage.
Last word of advice: when you're on the set, and the red light is on, you gotta shut up.
- Especially when you hear the clapper.
- Understood. And never look in the camera.
Let's go say hello.
- Good morning, Fernand.
- Jean, I need to talk to you. The kid's an extra for the day. I'm taking him now on the set.
Jean, it's not about the kid.
It's about you. You can't go in anymore.
You're joking, right!
No, I'm not joking. They're letting you go.
Here's you're last pay.
I'm fired? Just like that?
I want to see a manager!
The boss is not here this morning.
Come back this afternoon.
But I doubt they'll change their minds.
Well I won't take this lying down.
They don't know who they're dealing with.
I'm not going!
No. You must go.
We'll take the other street and blend in with the extras.
- Jean! - Don't give me a rough time.
- But, Jean!
Why must you always talk about politics?
How will we manage now with the landlord?
We'll have to pay for the hole.
I'm sure we'll find a solution.
Did you see about getting your job back as a boom operator?
Yep. They already filled the position.
But that can't be!
Why must this be happening to us right now?
Here.
My wages for being an extra.
You can have it.
I hope it helps to pay for the baby's room.
Now there's a repeat performance!
We're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself.
You don't care about us.
You just want to make sure you can live here! No, Jean.
That's not true, I swear it.
I swear it!
You're selfish!
Hypocrite!
I don't want your fucking dough!
Listen! I'm out of action.
There's no way we can support you.
Get the hell out!
But, Jean!
Why did you tell him that?
Hey, kitty.
Minou.
Come back!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Did you start this fire?
You're in big trouble you little brat!
- But I didn't do anything, sir.
- And this, what do you call this?
Why did you start this fire, miserable arsonist.
- You're parents will have to pay.
- They're both dead.
You don't get off that easy.
Anymore tricks up your sleeve?
Leave him alone.
I know this kid. He's the haberdasher's orphan.
- He even stole from his cousins.
- He's a hooligan.
- He belongs in a reform school!
- But I did nothing wrong!
C'mon folks, what's this: the Apocalypse!
C'mon, leave him alone.
This rapacious mutt just set fire to a dwelling of honest folks!
"Honest folks!" Ha, ha!
Show me half a dozen! Even one or two if you can!
Have you never been a kid and done stupid things?
C'mon! Clear away!
C'mon, hop on, kid!
C'mon, c'mon!
Cheers, mates!
Rise up, rise up!
The hour is near to start the revolt!
The hour is near to start the revolt.
Yipper!
Now my Olive.
Hang in there. It's all over.
Will I have to go to reform school?
Of course not. No reform school.
You're with Jean and Elodie, you're not alone.
As a matter of fact, Jean lost his job.
- They can't keep me anymore.
- Shit. Talk about bad luck.
I sure hope I'Araignée didn't leave for nothing.
Why do you say that?
He made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone, especially you.
He left his room for your benefit.
You understand what I'm saying?
He wanted you to stay.
So he arranged a meeting... between Elodie and the landlord.
But I didn't want him to leave!
- Tell me it's not true.
- I'm afraid it is.
That's why you can't go.
Do you understand?
C'mon, artilleryman, we can't lose hope, right?
You'll see, things will work out for Jean.
And that little mishap with the fire, it's nothing serious.
Not at all...
Besides, nothing should be taken seriously.
- So you're not angry with me anymore?
- Angry?
- Oh, it's you.
- Yep, it's me. I forgot my keys.
Elodie!
Elodie. Are you there?
- No.
She'll be back later tonight.
- What are you talking about?
Ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the Transatlantique.
- But the Transat is closed in the evening.
- No, no. It's the annual dinner of the Montmartre Fellowship Alumni.
It will end late.
And you, what's new?
Nothing.
I've been looking for work for over a month.
"Sorry, sir, there is nothing."
"There's nothing" "There's nothing"!
"There's nothing" "There's nothing"!
Fucking crisis!
One of these days, the keg will blow!
The misers will still get away with it, but not for long!
They'll get what's coming to them!
We'll make mincemeat out of them!
You hear me, Olivier?
Look at what I prepared.
Stuffed tomatoes!
- You made this?
Mother taught me how.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- No, stay here, I'll get it.
- Oh. It's the charming Mado!
- Good evening, Jean.
Well, do come in, come in.
Sorry to disturb you...
I was supposed to go out with a girlfriend, but her mom fell sick.
- So I thought maybe you would like to...
No.
Not exactly.
I was thinking more about Olivier...
There is no school tomorrow, I promised to take him to the restaurant.
If that would make him happy.
Right Olivier?
Would you like to go out with Mado?
Oh yes, Jean.
Thank you!
I won't bring him back late.
I hope not!
We'll leave a key under the mat.
Here. I brought you a tie so you'll look elegant.
Thank you.
I'll put it on right now. And some Gomina gel.
Alright, get a move on!
So...everything arranged for tomorrow?
You're certain?
Yes.
At what time they'll pick him up?
At 2 pm. His uncle Henri will pick him up.
Poor kid...
He's doesn't know yet?
No.
It will be a terrible blow.
Yes, I know.
Anyway, thanks for taking him out tonight.
I really like him, you know.
I'm ready!
Oh, my. Really classy, Olivier!
Monsieur will taste the wine.
Ah, it is good, huh!
A little warm.
It is not warm, young man, it is ambient.
My friend Bougras says the Saint-Emilion is better when brought up from the cellar.
Would you have a bottle from the cellar?
We do. But if I may, I would not recommend it.
But monsieur Maurice!
If it's Madame's wish, we get a bottle from the cellar.
And may Madame and Monsieur enjoy an excellent meal.
Thank you.
Lesson number 5: the client is king.
Forgive me, madame, or mademoiselle... your face looks familiar.
I'm sure we've met before, but I don't seem to remember.
- Perhaps you can help me?
- Sir!
Can't you see I'm with my fiance?
And, bingo!
Lesson number 6:
Never bother a lady if she hasn't been introduced to you.
To draw her attention, have a garcon deliver a card.
Or flowers.
- To our health!
- Ah no. You must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me.
Very well, Mado.
You could then propose a toast, but not usually with the ladies.
Was everything satisfactory?
It was.... exquisite!
- I would like some sweet strawberries.
- And for the young man?
How about a nice Paris-Brest?
It's very good.
- Isn't that a bicycle race?
- No, it's also a cake.
- Sir, do you have plum pudding?
- Most certainly.
- Let's go for the plum pudding!
- Very well, monsieur.
Apparently, it's as good as love.
I'd like to thank you again, Mado.
It was really... really... romantic!
- Ah, I'll give you back the tie.
- No.
Keep it. You'll have a souvenir of me.
A souvenir?
But we'll see each other soon.
That's what I meant.
You can keep it forever.
Alright.
So long, gentleman.
Elodie!
Elodie!
Hello, Ernest.
What did he say? - Nothing.
I didn't tell him.
- What?
You were supposed to tell him last night.
Henri will arrive in half an hour.
But surely, we must tell him now.
I was wondering if we couldn't keep him.
Listen, Jean, we're not starting that again.
It's not possible.
God knows when you'll find a job.
And in 3 months I won't be able to work because of the baby. I'm sad too.
But that's how it is. Nothing we can do. Elodie.
The order for No.4! Be right there!
It's coming.
Bon appétit.
Where is he now?
He borrowed your fire cups to treat Bougras.
Well, you're going to tell him right now.
Almost done?
- Only two more to go.
- Ah well, go for it.
Firing up!
Oh, my!
If you can heal me with those, I'll buy you a drink.
Mother would often treat me.
She said it's better than medication.
Okay, do the last one.
Firing up!
Ooh, that one's really hot.
Now all we have to do is wait.
Come in!
Greetings, Bougras!
Greetings, Jean.
So, you're playing doctor, now?
He's good at it too. My lord!
It's gonna be a hot day.
Does that surprise you?
It is after all, the beginning of July.
You know, Olivier, in life, there are events more serious than others.
But they shouldn't lead us to over-dramatize.
Everything works out.
All one needs is to show a little willpower.
Isn't that so?
Yes.
Olivier, I want you to listen to me.
I have news to tell you.
Don't worry, it's actually good news.
As you know, Henri has become your legal guardian.
That means... you'll be like his son.
Can you imagine just how lucky you are?
Don't look so gloomy.
You know we did everything we could to keep you.
But in the long run, it's for your own good.
From now on, you'll live in a large apartment, with wall-to-wall carpets.
Two housemaids.
Two!
You'll be able to go to college and get a real education.
Not to mention, lucky dog, a summer vacation in Touraine.
A few dozen hectares, apparently.
You'll be living like a king!
We didn't want to tell you sooner so as not to... as not to...
Well, that's it.
Your uncle's car should arrive soon.
You mean now?
Right now? Well, yes.
Right now.
But couldn't I go stay with Privat instead?
That, my boy, is your fault.
You had your chance.
Now.
I go down to wait for the car.
I'll let you know.
I gotta pack a suitcase.
No.
You won't have to.
It's already packed.
It's at the Transat.
So long, Bougras.
Take those yogurt jars off of me.
C'mon, do it quick.
You'll see, Mr. Bougras.
Usually, if all goes well, in one hour, you should be feeling better.
I'm sure I'm will.
Thank you, my lad.
You've been a good nurse.
You took good care of me.
Never mind that, I'll put those away.
Is Olivier ready?
Now, now, artilleryman.
You're not gonna start whining?
You're not a girl are you?
No, Mr. Bougras.
C'mon, then...
Let's shake on it, for old time's sake?
It's for me?
I can't take it.
It's too nice.
I can't.
There you go.
C'mon, get out of here my Olive.
C'mon.
Get out of here. Scat!
Go!
Come on, Olivier, you're not saying goodbye?
Don't worry, you'll be like our son, now.
So long, Olive.
You're in luck.
Take a load of this car!
Goodbye, Châteauneuf!
- See you soon, Olivier!
- Goodbye, Olive!
You like mint lollipops, I think.
Where are we going, uncle?
Your place?
You know, we had a look at your school grades, you'll need classes this summer to catch up.
The director was categorical.
The director?
The director of the college where you will now further your studies.
It's a good establishment. You'll see.
And one of the best in churning out successful students.
Marceau, our son, attended this college.
Even got an award for Latin in the main contest event.
How unfortunate he's not as healthy as you!
Your mother wanted you to get a good education.
Ah... here we are.
I'll spend the entire summer here?
But you'll see, you'll enjoy it here.
Come, let's go see the director.
Say, how long are you staying in Touraine, with your Delage?
My chauffeur is prudent, but still it's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km.
All the same, it's fantastic. What will they think of next?
This will be your bed.
Please remember to pass along my regards to your wife and to Marceau.
- How is he? - Doing fine.
We hope to bring him home by the end of this summer.
However, with this illness, a Sword of Damocles always hangs above our heads.
I share your concerns.
- Dear uncle, may I... - Two minutes.
Olivier.
I hope you'll be as bright as your cousin.
Uncle, I need to use the toilet!
Have you been following Gorgoulov's trial?
It's an abomination!
Ah, is the child's uniform ready?
It's the right size.
At least, I hope.
Here you go my boy, try this on for me.
What's the matter with you?
He pissed himself!
- Oliver... what's wrong with you?
- Never mind, I'll take care of it.
Come with me, you filthy little boy.
I beg your forgiveness, M. Le directeur.
Make nothing of it.
How long ago did his mother pass away?
4 or 5 months.
I'm worried we might have been a little hasty in all of this.
Would you mind if I kept him for this evening?
No, not at all.
I'll try to cheer him up.
Do you like to go see Mayol, the singer?
Not really, uncle.
What then would please you?
- I'd love to go to the Lapin Agile.
- The cabaret in Montmartre?
That establishment does not allow children.
I used to go with my mother.
"Parlez-moi d'amour
"Redites-moi des choses tendres
"Votre beau discours
"Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre
"Pourvu Que toujours
"Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes"
It's funny...
The last time I was here with mama, we were sitting at this very table.
Why ever would your mother bring you here?
We came to dance.
Tangos, especially.
Olivier, are you crying?
No.
It's nothing.
We should not have come here.
It will only make you miserable. No.
On the contrary.
I'm happy.
Very happy.
Careful, Châteauneuf!
Your uncle could have brought you back sooner.
Go to bed now. Go on.
That should teach you not to wake everybody up.
Châteauneuf, don't be a show-off.
I run a quiet dorm and it will stay that way.
We're not in Montmartre.
- But it wasn't me, sir. - Silence!
We don't answer back, Châteauneuf.
And now, go to sleep. Everybody.
You're a snitch, Châteauneuf!
Did you hear that?
He's from Montmartre.
And already snitching on us!
No one talks to him.
He's now on quarantine.
- Yeah, good idea.
- Silence!
Hey urchin. You can't play with us.
We don't need you.
Debézieux. Well done: 16/20.
Saron, almost perfect.
Once again, you've earned 19.
I kept the best for last.
No, Châteauneuf did not get 20.
After only 2 months, I wouldn't expect as much from him.
Luckily for him, there are no marks below zero, because Châteauneuf would have scored -6.5.
And for your enjoyment, I will demonstrate how Châteauneuf... translates the famous phrase:
"If you want peace
"prepare for war."
You haven't made any progress during the summer, Châteauneuf.
Being Mr. Desrousseau's nephew or not, you are not exempt from being intelligent.
Follow your cousin Marceau's example. He was my best student.
Good morning, Olivier.
I'm Marceau, your cousin.
We've met at the house on a few occasions.
It's pretty hard to forget.
My Latin teacher never stops talking about you.
Good morning, Marceau.
No need to be formal, lad.
You're a poet?
We'll understand each other!
"Child of a fallen leaf,
"subjected to every wind
"as the weeks and months of summer pass
"wrapped in the sheets of my friends' solitude
"I call the names of Bougras, Mado, I'Araignée
"No answer to be heard. They have forgotten me.
"And so I ask:
What has become of them?
"You, my parents as distant as strangers be
"What secrets have you not dared share with me?"
Not bad.
Inspired by Rutebeuf, and a bit of a tearjerker, but... given your situation, this piece is fitting.
That poem is private!
Perhaps I should teach you the finer aspects of caesura.
I don't need your help.
Couldn't I be of use to you in Latin?
- What about your sister?
- Mind your own business.
I'm starting to like you, obscure little friend.
I was afraid you would bore me.
My parents dumped you here for the whole summer?
Ah, the bastards!
They could have brought you with them to Touraine at least!
I sympathize. I spent the last 8 months in the sanatorium.
I'm cured, finally. I'm just out and I bring you back home!
Isn't life beautiful?
The headmaster will never consent.
You're mother picks me up tomorrow.
Nihil obstat.
I've just seen the principal, and, between two Latin quotes, I've told him that my mother had instructed me to take you home. You are free.
I release you from the bonds of slavery.
Long live freedom!
Long live André Breton!
- Who's this Breton?
- The pope of surrealism, of course!
The pope of what? My God!
I'll need to tend to your education.
You are now entering the Holy of Holies.
You may enter.
You are familiar with this apartment? Yes.
I mean not that familiar.
You must always look impressed by the luxury... of good standing that is the foundation of my parent's success.
They're really quite vain.
Mother, especially.
She's a great lady, my mother.
She's wonderful!
I'm often angry with her, but I adore her anyway.
As for my father, he's a dreamer who can't get over having become a successful businessman.
This is the living room.
- You know what he really wanted to be?
- An opera singer.
- How did you know that?
- Because he told me, of course!
- We went to the Lapin agile together.
- That's just like him!
He took advantage of you to get away.
You've already reached a level of trust with him?
Yes, but he doesn't want me talking about it.
To my mother, perhaps.
As for me, you can talk about anything.
This is the dining room.
Impressive.
Come, I'll take you to your room.
Put your luggage on the bed and follow me.
And this... is my lair.
You like jazz?
Are you familiar with The Duke?
No.
What about Louis Armstrong?
No, not him either.
He's giving a Paris concert at the end of this month.
Can you believe it?
Either way, I'm going to meet him this year.
My parents have offered me a trip to New York for my holidays.
Getting sick does have its advantage: your parents will grant your every wish.
Can you imagine?
I'm going to spend New Year's Eve at the Cotton Club...
But I have a friend who's living in New York!
His name is David Zober.
I have no news of him.
Well then, give me his address.
I will find this little buddy of yours.
Are you familiar with benzoin?
No.
Take a seat.
You'll get to know it.
- It's an intoxicating oil.
- For cooking?
Of course not!
I'm talking about the mind, not the body.
Do you like this piece?
Yeah, really cool.
Indubitably!
Duke Ellington!
Isn't this dangerous for someone with tuberculosis.
That, my dear, is the least of my worries.
Besides, I'm cured.
You scared?
No!
- You've never smoked before?
- Yes, quite often.
Some "Ich Lif" .
My God, what an accent!
High Life! "Vie élevée."
High Life.
You will experience the elevation of souls, the communion of spirits.
You see, me... I would come across as a type of Lafcadio.
Who's that?
- The Vatican Cellars.
André Gide.
You know him? - No.
The perfect crime.
When you think of it, the sanatorium had its merits.
I learned the two things a man must lose in his life.
His virginity and his illusions.
Here.
"There, everything is order and beauty,
"Luxury, serenity and voluptuousness."
What is voluptuousness?
That is about to manifest.
Don't move, I'll be right back.
Olivier.
I'd like you to meet Julienne, my mother's god-daughter, resident of the Demoiselles de la Légion d'honneur.
She holds my mother's dearest fervor... when it comes to my marriage.
- Julienne, I'd like to present...
- I know him, Marceau.
- You're the one who's mother died.
- Yes, that's me.
Out of kindness my parents decided to adopt him.
Would you like a benzoin ciggy?
No, thank you.
My feet are killing me.
Saint-Denis is quite the walking distance.
Olivier, make yourself useful.
Julienne has sore feet.
Remove her shoes.
Come on, hurry up.
Slowly, Olivier!
Unlace them gently.
Give them a massage.
My feet are really sore.
Don't tickle me.
Just give me a massage.
Look.
Have you ever seen a woman before?
Have you ever seen a woman's breasts?
Oh, you little scoundrel!
You're a pervert!
How dare you!
This is not your place.
Now go to your room!
Scram!
Write me a poem about Julienne's breasts.
- Ma'am, where would you like this luggage?
- Carry them to my room.
Marguerite, tell the chauffeur to bring in the apples last.
We'll put them in the store room.
Which is Master Olivier's room, now
Very well, madame.
Good day, mother.
Did you have a nice trip? - Excellent!
Where were you?
- At the restaurant, with Olivier.
We weren't going to die of starvation awaiting your return.
Come now.
Give me a hug instead of making vile remarks.
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.
Let me have a look at you.
You're right, you do look well.
Why did you bring Olivier back a day sooner?
You could have let me know.
I could have avoided the detour to the college.
Listen, he'd been couped up long enough, don't you think?
Good day, Olivier.
Good day, aunt.
I suppose Marceau has already given you the grand tour?
He has, yes.
Very well. We'll now go to your room.
Since you are here, I will give you...
- The house rules!
- That's mean!
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
This is where we keep the apples that we bring back... every year from our estate in Montrichard.
Fortunately for you, the harvest was not abundant this year.
I hope you like apple sauce and apple pie.
Here we eat it all the time.
- These are your belongings?
- Yes, aunt.
But they reek!
Well, we'll need to get rid of them.
Including the clothes you are wearing.
I will let you have Marceau's old things. You can tell mother is from Auvergne:
to her, a spade is a spade.
My dear child, you used to be more witty.
- These books are yours?
- Yes, aunt.
Marie Bashkirtseff?
How unexpected!
Schopenhauer?
You mean you're reading this at your age?
- No, aunt.
- It so happens he has... a certain culture.
I've read one of his poems. It's quite good.
Anyway, what he needs most is a good bath.
I will ask Marguerite to wash him in the laundry room. That's right.
We wouldn't want him staining the bathtub.
Come on, Marguerite, scrub harder. He's got to shine like a new penny.
Your cousin is a cute little angel.
- More so than moi, Marguerite?
- That's not the same thing.
You're a man, now.
Alright, Olivier.
Come out and dry yourself.
Hop, hop!
Voilà!
I say, aren't we a wee bit scrawny, my little urchin?
Alright.
I'm going to burn your clothes like Madame said.
Show me, Olivier.
Now, turn around.
It's funny seeing you wear my old trappings.
"Trappings"?
Ah, what an astute word.
Do I detect Montmartre's influence?
Marceau, your father and I decided... to prepare a little surprise for your homecoming.
Julienne will join us for dinner this evening.
She will be happy to see you.
She spoke so often of you.
Your father is picking her up at the print shop after work.
- Are you pleased?
- Yes, mother.
I burn!
Oh how I languish for Julienne!
I love her, not as in the Underworld, the ravager of a thousand men, But faithful, proud and a little diffident!
The divine...
- Good evening.
- Good evening, monsieur.
godmother!
Good evening, godmother.
My dear, how happy I am to see you.
And I'm not the only one.
Marceau is thrilled that you could join us for his homecoming.
It's been such a long time since you've last seen each other.
That's true!
I even wondered if I would recognize you!
Can you imagine?
It's now been over a year.
Seems to me like it was yesterday.
And your father, do you recognize him?
A your age you only change every 10 years.
At my age?
Am I that old?
Anyway, you have a much better disposition than when you left.
Good to see you.
Good.
Let us have dinner so that Julienne doesn't get home too late.
I must get you to test drive my new Delage.
Julienne.
Where's Olivier's setting?
In the kitchen.
He's eating with the maids, of course.
Why then did you tell him he was a member of the family?
They cured his illness, but apparently not his character.
Thank you.
Marceau, return immediately to the dining room.
Your stew is truly marvelous, Blanche.
Thank you, M. Marceau.
For the last time, return to the dining room.
Delicious, don't you think?
Blanche, see to it that M. Olivier joins us in the dining room.
- Yes, madame.
- Dear aunt, there's is no need.
Oh please, don't give me that!
Come on, let's go.
Look, Olivier.
Like this.
Sorry, aunt.
It's not your fault, Olivier.
Take note however that we don't say: "sorry", but "Please excuse me."
In conclusion, Olivier, we are too good for you.
Well my friend, say something.
Yes.
Be nice to your mother, Marceau.
What is that dress you're wearing?
Rochas? Poiret?
No, Schiaparelli.
What else you'd like to know?
I do like it.
- However... - Yes?
Your necklace doesn't suit it.
A little flashy, don't you think?
We can discuss it further after our meal, if you like.
Excellent idea, mother.
Besides, after our little cafe, you and Julienne could play us a duet?
With pleasure, god-mother.
With pleasure, mother.
With pleasure, aunt.
Olivier!
If you want us to keep you, you must change your attitude.
Go to your room immediately.
- But, aunt...
- Immediately!
Very well, aunt.
You're worse than Hitler.
Marceau, illness doesn't excuse everything.
I need no excuses, mother. And I'm not longer ill.
Marceau...
Marceau!
Marceau, wake up!
Wake up!
Please, wake up!
I'm okay. Don't move.
You had a spell.
I'll get your mother.
No, Olivier.
You didn't see a thing.
But it might be serious.
You must see a doctor.
Listen, Olivier.
All the tests indicate I am cured.
Makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fatigue.
Marceau!
Olivier, if you are a brother to me, swear you'll never speak about this to anyone.
Okay?
Come on, swear it.
I swear, Marceau.
Thanks, Olivier.
...we are pleased to have him join a jam session, a big round of applause for Mister...
Louis Armstrong!
I just cut my lip.
Don't mention anything to my Divine.
You swear?
Dear students, some of you might wonder why... you would need to learn Latin.
The pope, monsieur. No.
Now pick a word at random. - Light. - Perfect example of Latin roots.
Light comes from the word Lux, the light.
Something that is Lux-urious is something that is brilliant.
Your turn to choose a word, Châteauneuf.
Poetry.
Poetry comes from the Latin word poesis, which in turn comes from the Greek poïesis, meaning creation.
Delépine, which word would you like to know the root of?
Football.
Now here's an example of a barbaric term we adopted, let alone its simple translation in our language.
"Football", in our language should mean:
ball at the foot, from the Latin pedibus, meaning foot and... Excuse me...
Medical examination visit.
- I said in silence. - Visit. From the word vis.
To see. And medical, from Medicus, the doctor.
Châteauneuf? Yes, that's me.
- This is a surprise, Olivier! - Good day, Mr. Lehman.
I mean, doctor.
- I was about to ask you the same thing.
So did I. The number of patients I had in my care was dwindling;
Good, now open wide.
I hate myself for what happened to your mother.
Perhaps I didn't do enough for her.
- You didn't like me very much, did you?
- Well...
Believe me, I didn't want to take your father's place, Olivier.
I just wanted to help your mother. In any event, she didn't like you.
I think she did a bit. Now, sit straight.
For you it's very sad. She died so young.
I see your aunt is taking good care of you.
Everything is fine.
You're in perfect health. That's it. You can get dressed, now.
Thank you, doctor.
Tell me doctor?
- I would like to ask you...
- Yes?
When people get... when they come down with tuberculosis, can they get sick again, even after being cured?
Of course.
The terrible thing about this illness, a real cure still hasn't been found.
If we cough up blood, it means we're still sick?
Yes, and it's really serious.
It's typical, as are repeated coughs, and sometimes even loss of consciousness.
- Is it contagious?
- Oh yes, extremely contagious! But why are you asking me this? Well...
I want to write a poem on tuberculosis.
On tuberculosis? Yes, why not?
It's true, Lamartine...
La Dame aux camélias. Thank you, doctor.
You'll make yourself sick reading so much!
Are those shoes ready yet, Marguerite?
Yes, all done, madame.
Good evening, Olivier.
Reading is a healthy habit, Olivier, but not at the table.
What are you reading?
Still reading Without Family!
But I gave you that one over a month ago.
I love reading it over again.
Granted. But there are other books more essential.
You look lovely, dear aunt.
Well, aren't you the gallant one!
This evening gown is for the French Club.
Henri is taking me. You should say to the "Comédie
- Française", mother.
How could he possibly understand, he's unversed.
I know it's Saturday, but getting up at sunset is a bit exaggerated, don't you think?
Mother, I'm preparing myself for the time difference.
It is now 11 o'clock in New York. Don't plan too far ahead, Marceau.
Your trip is not official yet. Don't forget.
Come, my little outcast, I need to speak with you.
Thank you, Marguerite. You won't believe what's happening to me.
I'm in love! I met a woman yesterday at a Party gathering.
- What Party?
- The Communist Party!
You know, the Reds. She's simply amazing.
A mix between Louise Brooks and Rosa Luxemburg.
She's a surrealist like me.
A dream come true.
There's just one problem: she's 15 years older.
I want to read you a poem I wrote her.
"Crimson heart, pierced by faith,
"May he who has never loved you never reach your depth."
Not bad for a start, don't you think? I'm brilliant.
Go ahead, tell me.
"Marceau, you're brilliant."
- Marceau, you're brilliant.
- Oh no, it's pathetic.
You can't really understand poetry. You're stuck on Victor Hugo or Leconte de Lisle.
You know nothing about women.
You've never been in love.
I know nothing about women?
Her name is Mado.
And she's a taxi-girl. - Besides, we're engaged.
- Come on.
Don't make up stories just to try to impress me.
You'll see if I'm telling the truth. You'll see. Come.
Here.
Rinse your eyes on this.
She gave it me as a memento.
To someone else, you mean!
You probably stole it from your mother's boutique.
Nice piece, though.
And this is her calling card.
- She gave it to me personally.
You surprise me.
- Are you still seeing this Mado?
- Of course not.
Not since my arrival here. Don't look so sad.
We'll fix that.
- Very pretty! Look. I just started a new novel.
- Can you read it to me?
- Yes, of course.
"I was born, like everyone, from a mother and a father.
"And yet, I am not like everyone.
"One question haunts me:
"did my father and mother love each other?
"Were I not conceived in a state of love, I would rather die."
- You asked me to. You shouldn't!
You're violating my intimacy.
You're a little pervert! You shouldn't have... You don't understand!
It's not because you're older...
You wouldn't strike a sick person, would you?
That's just it, you're really sick.
- Dr Lehman says you're having a relapse. - What? Who's this Dr. Lehman?
You mentioned me?
It's the college physician.
I asked him about tuberculosis.
I know what happened to you the other day.
You were losing consciousness.
If you're spitting blood, it's serious and contagious.
You should inform your parents.
I see where you're going with this.
You want to stop me from leaving, send me back to the sanatorium and take my place, here.
- You're crazy, Marceau. - Hypocrite!
You think I didn't catch your little act with mother?
"You look lovely, dear aunt."
- Ass-licker.
- I'm doing it for you!
Don't forget you promised me your silence.
You're like a brother to me.
I owe you one.
Forgive me, mother.
I rather stop here.
I thought you had finally shed the awkward age, but you still revel in it.
Spare me your cliches.
My dear, your son is extremely rude right now.
Marceau, please!
If you want to go on your trip, you better clean up your act.
You are wanted on the telephone.
Hello! Oh yes.
Yes. I know who this is.
Listen, it's a delicate issue for me.
Good.
I will be there in 15 minutes, under the arches.
Let me see Olivier.
- He's not your child. - I know that. But I could be just like a father to him.
He chose not to go with you.
But he's no longer in his favorite neighbourhood.
Please stop right there, monsieur Privat. My wife would never allow it.
On what grounds?
You didn't take him in out of love.
Put yourself in her place.
You came to our home to kill your brother and Virginie.
And now you would want to take their son?
I didn't kill anyone.
And I spent time behind bars.
Thirteen years of my life.
I need this child to give meaning to my life.
But does he need you?
Even if we handed him over to you, think of what people would say.
Believe me, I can understand your pain.
But think about the day Olivier will learn everything about your past.
I'm certain he will be able to forgive me.
But once you tell him the whole truth, you'll be shattering the image he has of his parents.
Do you think you have the right to do that?
There's a ladder in the courtyard.
You climb up, and down the other side using the street lamp.
A 5 year-old could do it. There you'll see a bike.
You get on it, and within 10 minutes you wind up at the Bouchon de Champagne.
Here.
Here's some money to have a good time.
I'll take your place, in case the supervisor can't sleep.
I don't think I can pull it off.
I'm too scared.
I've done it dozens of times without ever getting caught.
"Audaces fortuna juvat", Olivier.
It's time to see if your life will be that of a sheep, or if you will write it yourself, every day.
Don't you want to see Mado again?
Good evening, mam'zelle Mado Good evening, m'sieur Hubert.
That wasn't very smart.
Are you angry with me?
Not at all!
I'm actually moved.
You can't follow me inside, though.
Now there, don't be sad.
Wait, I have an idea.
Jules?
Ask G.G. to come out with his accordion.
- I have a little commission for him.
Give him 10 francs, he'll be happy.
- I'll give him 20! - No, that's too much. You asked for me, Mado?
Yes, G.G. Here's a young client for you.
What shall I play for you?
Olivier, what would you like? A tango!
A tango for my little fiance.
The Most Beautiful Tango in The World?
- Yes, that's fine.
- I'm not a very good dancer.
I was forced, and this is only a temporary measure of course, to confiscate this elegant pen which arrived in the mail. - It was intended for Olivier?
- Indeed, madame.
In this college, we discourage possession of valuable objects... which would risk to excite the greed of certain pupils... towards their more fortunate peers.
I thought it might be you.
I'm not in the habit of spoiling children with gifts of this value.
- May I see Olivier? - By all means. I've already sent for him.
He's waiting in the vestibule.
Come in, Olivier.
I leave you together.
Good day, aunt. Who sent you this pen?
I...
I don't know, aunt.
Don't lie to me, Olivier.
It could only have come from him.
Have the courage to tell me the truth.
Yes.
It is a gift from Monsieur Privat.
I will send it back. You must never accept anything from this man.
But why not, aunt?
You're too young to know about these things.
But I need to know!
Since you put it like that, I'll tell you.
One day, in December of 1917, the war was still raging,
Privat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun.
- He wanted to kill them, Olivier.
I don't believe you. Why was my mother intent on living with him?
I'm still trying to figure that out. Your mother and I never saw eye to eye on many things.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I didn't want you to get upset.
I hope we never have to discuss this matter ever again.
Anyway, sooner or later, you would have found out.
Enter.
Of course you will.
Because you are pure.
Wild child.
Street child.
- Please stop gloating at my expense! - You see, she dropped me. Who did?
This militant girl who wrote these pathetic lines.
I'm down to listening to this music for rejected lovers.
All around me,
"everything is order and beauty."
And yet, my pain is real. Why?
Marceau...
You knew about... about my parents and Privat?
What are you talking about?
Well...
The time Privat... the time he came here.
Your mother told me the story. The Divine finally coughed it up?
Yes.
Privat fired shots at them.
In fact, it happened right here.
In this very room where your parents stayed. I was only 2 at the time.
But look.
Look at the mirror.
Impacts left by the bullets.
See where love can lead?
A few centimeters to the side... and you'd never have been born, my little outcast.
But rest assured,
Why didn't you tell me?
Because this story is boring as hell, my friend.
Two grown men love the same woman. An ordinary drama based on jealousy.
You're mama was nothing more than a small-time goddess, as my mother put it.
Come on, cheer up.
I don't want to see you suffer, my little angel. Please spare me your expressions of grandeur!
We are both injured and abandoned souls.
Like two starlings fallen from the nest.
Yes?
M. Marceau, a girl is asking for you.
- A girl? - Mlle Charlotte Dalet. Charlotte?
Have her come in, quick!
A woman leaves me, I find another. - Who is she?
- The nurse from the sanatorium. - The one who...
- Who taught me how to love. - You know what you have to do?
- Change wards.
- Good day, Marceau.
- Charlotte! What a joy to see you again!
I'll give you some privacy.
Stop it, Marceau.
So, if I can't kiss you, what brings you to Paris?
I shouldn't be telling you this, but I don't want to deceive you.
The director will be sending a letter to your parents.
A letter?
Whatever for? You're having a serious relapse, Marceau.
The lab you visit for your routine check-ups... has sent us the results of your samples.
The samples indicate you are once again infected.
But you said I had been cured.
The pneumothorax was extremely effective.
But when it comes to tuberculosis, you can never be sure. I must go back to the sanatorium?
I'm afraid so.
Upon your release, you registered less than 1000 BK.
But today, you must be well over 100.000! It's a serious relapse.
You must start a new treatment.
Worst of all, you could have infected your entire family.
I understand why you wouldn't let me kiss you.
How convenient for you.
You can work on my case.
I'll be once again your little patient. I'll be there with you.
Every hour, every second! - You have no right to say that!
Even if the truth is painful to hear. So there, goodbye!
Are we eavesdropping, now?
I'm expecting a love letter.
- You're at that age!
- See you.
Well, well. A letter for Olivier.
It's from America.
Nothing for me.
I am gloom, the grieving inconsolable widower.
"The Prince of Aquitaine at the forsaken tower!"
Marceau the early bird.
- I hope you're not ill, at least.
Of course not, mother.
I feel great!
What's with him this morning?
He must be in love, madame.
Good for him.
But not a word about this to Julienne.
Get up, lazy- bones!
Even though we're on vacation, we don't get up any later.
America?
Thank you, Marguerite.
It's from David.
He must have quite a few stories to share!
There are tons of postcards!
- Skyscrapers! - And even photos.
Show me.
The mail has arrived?
Obviously, because you received your letter.
- But, Marceau?
- Monsieur Marceau?
You're not going to read your letter?
- Did he get mail this morning?
- No.
He was so disappointed his new sweetheart hadn't written to him.
What are you doing?
I'm depositing the 2nd mail batch, as I always do at noon.
There is a 2nd mail run?
Of course. This is Paris!
Since you're going back to college I advise you to take a Balzac.
It will take you all week to read "Les Illusions perdues".
or even "La Cousine Bette".
Good morning, father.
I just received a letter that concerns you. Really?
You know what it might be about? No, I can't think of anything. You know, this American friend I wrote to...?
Well, he agreed.
He would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish.
I can now confirm your travel arrangements.
You will embark on the De Grâce, on the morning of December 16.
- Happy? - You bet!
Your mother and I are sad you won't spend Christmas with us.
But more important, we want you to be happy. You'll see, Mr. DeWilde will make good company.
What does he do for a living? He owns a few movie theaters in New York.
They call them Nickelodeons.
Ah yes, the penny cinema.
Here's one... A letter from the sanatorium.
I have a hunch I know what it's about.
It's what I thought.
Well they've got some nerve!
They're claiming reimbursement for a window pane I broke by accident.
Medical services are already expensive. They should cover that.
I'll call the director immediately.
Hello, mademoiselle?
Get me number 16 at St - Pierre - Les
- Bains, Haute - Loire.
Marceau Desrousseau speaking.
I'd like to speak to the director, please. Thank you.
I beg you, Marceau, be diplomatic.
Take the receiver.
And learn from the master.
Hello? Mister director?
Yes:
No, not very well.
My parents just received a letter from your accounting department.
It claims reimbursement of a window pane I accidentally broke.
It was a mistake?
I'm happy to hear it.
I will let you take care of it.
Thank you, mister director.
Give my best to madame.
Goodbye. You had gall.
Yes, you went straight to the point!
From now on, I will have you deal directly with my creditors.
With pleasure, father.
Monsieur is served.
You're crazy, Marceau.
Voila.
Tell me what you think.
"concerning the state of health of our son.
"in a sanatorium close to Paris.
"As soon as we can, we will inform you of the...
"address of this establishment,
"so that you may share with them our son's medical records.
"Yours truly..." etc.
Pretty good, right? You're out of your mind, Marceau.
You can't do that.
Charlotte said it would be suicide.
Charlotte says that to keep me in the sanatorium. As you can see, I'm in good health.
That's not true, Marceau. Even yesterday I could hear you coughing.
Excuse me.
I must mail this at once.
Stand up!
Stand up! Companions in misery.
- What's going on, Olivier?
- I want you to stay out of this. - You'll be able to go back...
- Once you're back to health.
- Nothing could be more uncertain.
So I would prefer being overseas.
I would rather die at the Cotton Club instead of the asylum.
You won't say a word about it to my parents.
You promised.
Yes, but I didn't know just how serious this is.
Not to say the number of people you can contaminate.
I will tell them everything. If you do, I'll tell them of your outing to Mado.
They'll send you to your grandpa's to become a blacksmith's apprentice.
You're such a bastard.
I don't give a damn! - I don't want you to die, you understand?
- I think you just want me to stay here.
You wouldn't have the balls.
Just wait and see.
- Who is it? - It's me, Olivier.
Come in.
Something really serious.
Well, what is it?
It's, hm...
I'm sorry I didn't make it to the circus on my birthday.
That's it?
You scared me. It was quickly forgotten, Olivier.
I forgive you, of course.
You must get up early tomorrow. The holidays are over.
Yes, aunt.
Such a strange boy.
Ah! If he had Marceau's education!
If Marceau had his state of health!
- So that's it. You're going to play me like a violin, now?
Really, you're not sparing me anything.
You think I'm going to roll over like a dog? "Don't go, I'll spill the beans"
You're totally wrong.
Here, you forgot you beret.
You'll be back within the hour.
You read too much "Without Family".
You should reflect on the difference between literature and reality.
- Farewell, Marceau.
Wake up, Olivier. It's time!
It's 7 o'clock.
But...
Olivier?
- You haven't seen him? - No.
Not this morning. Yes.
He told me he had to leave to review his Latin.
I helped him till past midnight.
He was probably intent on leaving without waking me.
I came to tell you he's ill.
A simple phone call would have sufficed.
I have fond memories of this place.
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.
As for your cousin, I hope it's nothing serious.
I was their family physician in Montmartre.
Yes of course, Montmartre.
Hey! guys!
They should count their forts.
We should have some enemies.
We were once at peace, but everybody got confused.
Hey! Wait for me.
You're not fighting anymore with the riffraff of Bachelet St.?
That's ancient history!
Let's go, I'm starved. See you! See you Capdeverre.
I'm hungry too.
See you later! See you, Loulou.
Don't you look dapper in those god awful pants!
So long.
I need some grub too.
So long, Riri.
Bougras!
M'sieur Bougras!
- Where to? - I have no idea.
If you see him again, tell him... he ran a pigsty in here.
It reeked as hell!
No problem, young man.
They're in a rush and I'm under the gun.
- Jean is fine?
- Not so bad. - Did he find work?
- Yes.
Yes. And how is the baby?
- Leg of lamb "Soissons".
- Coming up. - You were saying?
- You're baby, how's he doing? An apple pudding with Leg of Lamb "Soissons".
Bon appétit.
The baby?
He's adorable.
He's with Mrs. Hacque.
She's babysitting. Go see him!
Will do, Elodie.
So long, Elodie.
Glazier!
He's a bit like your cousin.
Isn't he the cutest?
I often take care of him.
Poor Elodie never stops.
And with Jean without a steady job, and he likes to drink a bit.
In the end, you did well to leave.
- But I was forced to leave!
- Well, you know what I mean.
You were such a hooligan!
Your aunt and uncle... do they treat you well?
Yes, madame Hacque.
In retrospect, your mother's death...
I wouldn't say it was a lucky break, far from it, mothers are irreplaceable.
But for your future...
Often we say: a blessing in disguise.
Ah, here comes Elodie.
It's me, my little treasure!
My love, it's your mama.
I came to tell you I won't be off work until 2:30pm.
He's a real cakewalk your little cherub.
You gave me a hell of a scare my little angel.
That's too easy.
You're a bastard, Marceau.
You think you can just die off like that?
Do whatever you like with your life?
Didn't you think about the others?
Your parents? Julienne?
Me?
What will become of me if you... if you die? Now, now.
Don't worry so much.
That's enough.
You want me to say you're right.
Is that it? I have given it some thought.
I decided I'll talk to my parents.
You're lying. Hang on, my Doubting Thomas.
You want my passport?
They're yours.
Without them, I can't go. It's a trick.
You'll only take them back!
What else do you need, then?
- Give it to me.
- It's a trick!
I'll show you a trick.
So, little outcast?
Happy now?
Dear Olivier,
The landscape hasn't changed much in the last 6 months.
Boredom here has reached a new philosophical dimension.
Luckily, the pain from the pneumothorax keeps me awake.
I'm so jaded that seeing your face again would bring back my spirits.
And so, if you can, please come.
The sanatorium is near Saugués. Find a way to get sent away to live with your grandpa.
I wait for you, my Olive, without fail. - Marceau
This morning, therefore, the supervisor found Olivier's scarf in the yard.
Yes, and what of it?
It was found at the bottom of the gardener's ladder... which was leaning against the school wall, ostensibly in order to jump over to the other side.
Furthermore, in doing Olivier's bed, the chambermaid found this.
I judged it would be best to notify you before talking to Olivier.
You don't think that Olivier... Mister director, I know him. I can't imagine him doing such a thing.
And yet, the evidence is obvious. I'd say a little too obvious.
Do you believe, mister director, that a student jumping the wall would leave the ladder behind?
moreover his scarf bearing his name?
Or keeping such compromising evidence in the dormitory?
I would rather think he was the target of a prank.
A very bad schoolboy prank. I think my husband is correct in his assessment, mister director.
Our nephew knows what fate would await him should he do such a thing.
We would send him off to his grandparents, in Auvergne.
You're probably right.
I should have known better. If one of our students was bent on tarnishing the image of your nephew, rest assured he will be punished accordingly.
I will deal with this matter immediately.
What happened in 1685?
Delépine! The assassination of Henri IV by Ravaillac, monsieur.
He would have been mighty, this Ravaillac, to assassinate a king who had been dead for 75 years!
Yes, Susse!
1685, revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV, sir.
Well done. Now, what happened in...
Be seated, children.
I'm here to discuss a serious matter.
It would appear that one of you... wanted to get Châteauneuf accused of jumping the wall.
His scarf was left behind in the yard as evidence... and other objects I won't mention at this time, were planted in his personal belongings in the dormitory.
Perhaps it was only meant as a stupid prank. But I would summon the guilty party to come forth in this instant, otherwise I will have to take measures against the entire class.
"A fault confessed is half redressed". Gentlemen!
I'm waiting.
Châteauneuf, you would like to speak?
Nobody played a trick on me, sir.
I did jump the wall last night.
I don't want the entire class punished on my account.
- And where did you go? - To see a friend.
The girlies!
- What do you mean: "the girlies"?
- The streetwalkers, sir.
Olivier!
Shame on you! You're a disgrace.
I don't want you living with us anymore.
At least you don't look like a hooligan!
Come on, let's go.
Ho, Victor!
Can't this wait?
- She's all yours, Antonin. - You're holding us up.
Adios!
Give it to me.
You will call me "Tonton".
And that girl... not a word about her to granny.
All right, Tonton.
You'll see. There isn't much here to lift grannie's spirits.
She's not thrilled with your arrival.
With grandpa, it's different.
He just loves telling stories.
So he's happy that you're coming.
Besides, since injuring his leg, he's been bored stiff.
Listen, I must teach you a phrase in "patois", and you will repeat it to him.
Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue. Say it.
Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue.
We don't have much time for you to learn it.
We're here. There's the "oustaou".
- Go on, say the phrase.
- Oh, Gustou, beni fara monegue.
"Allo pitchou"!
Let me look at you.
You have your father's eyes. Come on in!
I prepared a snack for you.
You must be hungry after your trip.
Here were are.
Over here, it's not like at Victoria's.
It will be a lot different than my daughter's apartment.
There. You'll see.
We can be quite comfortable here, too. Sit over here.
We'll get you something to eat. Here.
This will be your pocket knife.
You must give a coin in return.
It's the custom.
- Will this do, Tonton?
It's not for the money.
It's to preserve friendship.
You're grandma isn't here.
She's picking mushrooms.
And a bit of water, of course!
Well, then?
- How is it, good?
- Victor, where are you?
See that door, it's your room.
You can put your things.
Will you show him how to forge?
Yes, you can watch me smith iron.
And if you're not too tired, you can give me a hand.
See you later, Tonton.
I say, you look a bit pale to me.
Don't worry, here you'll soon get back your color.
Here comes grannie.
Victor didn't warn you? She's a bit of a grouch.
She doesn't like kissing very much.
Give grandma a hug, Olivier.
Careful! Dummy, you'll make the mushrooms tip over.
- We're in for a treat tonight!
- No. You'll have to wait until Sunday.
So?
Are you the little scamp my daughter went crazy over?
Anyway, he's a good boy.
And very polite if you can believe it.
We'll see.
He's one of the best blacksmiths in the country.
Okay, grandpa.
Ah.
There you are.
- This one?
- Yes, it will stir the fire.
In 2 months, you'll have man's muscles!
You can stop now, Olivier.
You should tour the stable and say hi to the cows.
You'll find 3. They're kind.
There's Dourade, the most assured.
Then, La Marcade, and finally, Poumérade, the one with the spots. - Where is the stable?
- In the back.
You can go.
Hello cows!
How are you?
And you, La Marcade. And you are La Dourade.
How are you, Poumérade?
Let me introduce myself.
Normally I live in Montmartre.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here, you hear me?
He knows what to expect, now. If that bandit ever comes near the farm again.
What is the sense of adding misery to misery?
Come on, now. He provoked me, right? I didn't start anything.
- We must understand him. - Understand him!
If you can understand a criminal, you can understand me as well.
If he ever comes close to the lad he knows what to expect.
I thought your god was the god of forgiveness.
Leave my god alone! I'm taking the animals to the fields.
Make sure the boy doesn't leave the farm unaccompanied.
Why not? He's not in prison, here.
You read what Victoria wrote in her letter:
you must never leave that little scoundrel out of your sight!
You'd think Victoria makes the rules in my home!
Could you please call "pitchou"?
Olivier! Go see your grandfather.
Right, read me that article.
"The Nazi party stated that the Germans have rallied in great numbers...
"by Adolf Hitler to burn all books deemed subversive...
"and decadent in the public square.
"Several million books were reduced to ashes on the morning of May 5."
You see, Olivier, when the world's train leaves its tracks, no one knows where it will stop.
Why would anyone want to burn books?
They bring no harm. They don't want people to think! They're being groomed to be like machines.
But tell me, you read very well, how can you be doing so poorly in class, at least according to your aunt Victoria?
- I don't know, grandpa. - You don't know...
Furthermore, it seems you sneak out of the college at night. You're a real Escoulas!
In our family we always had rebels.
Look at me: I'm the only Red in this country of Whites!
Say, grandpa?
Yes?
The sanatorium where Marceau is staying, it's in this region, right?
I say, you go straight to the point.
You've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanatorium.
Tell me, did you come here to see Marceau?
- Yes, grandpa. - It's good to tell the truth. But...
Victoria was very clear that under no circumstance... you were to go to the sanatorium.
But why would she object?
She must have her reasons. You see, we're alike.
You think so?
And why is that?
Because I want to see Marceau too! I really miss my grandson.
He grew up here.
Always running after girls in the hills, and fishing for trout or crayfish.
We had some great times, him and me.
But now, it only hurts to know he's there.
The doctor told me I couldn't go, that I could catch his illness.
But mark my words:
we're going to see him together! - Really? - As real as I am an Escoulas.
I looked at the map, it's about 50 km.
We're not going to take the road.
The mountain trails will save us at least 10 km.
We'll take a horse and buggy, and I'll tell them I'm taking you to the animal fair in Langeac.
Will they let us go?
They'll say I'm crazy. But I'm head of this family. - I can do what I want, right?
- Yes, grandpa! Hold on.
Don't get your spirits too high.
I need to know if you can keep a secret.
With Victor and grannie, you have to act a bit, show them you're not really thrilled about coming with me.
- Right. - Good.
We shouldn't arouse their suspicions.
We'll leave Sunday at dawn.
But until then...
That means we won't arrive before nightfall. They'll figure out we didn't go to Langeac.
So what?
Once I've seen Marceau, they can think what they want.
I don't care.
At least we're lucky, the weather's on our side.
Hopefully we won't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass.
Let's go, Nono. Let's go!
That's it, grandpa!
- I gave him some oats. - That's good.
- Here.
Let's have a little feast!
Some ham, bread and wine.
That's my Holy Trinity.
You see, whatever Victoria might think,
I wouldn't trade a single tree from these mountains... for all the lights in Paris.
Say, grandpa? Why doesn't grannie like being kissed? You must understand her.
She lost 2 children.
That made her a little colder.
If you had known her when she was in her 20s, She was beautiful. A real eye-popper.
You know, for our marriage, we undertook the white stick ceremony.
The white stick ceremony?
What's that? If the fiancee placed a broom on its flip-side against her door, it meant she didn't want you.
- That is so funny.
- You think so? Damn it! I didn't sleep all night.
But the next morning, grannie had turned all the brooms on the farm on the right side.
And even the filthy ones.
If only she could hear me!
At the time, she just loved clinging to my arm as we danced.
What are you wishing for, young mountaineer? What did you hope to acquire if you are unwilling to dance?
Qué volio cerca, jovo de la montagna?
Que volio cerca, Si volio pas danser? If you didn't want to dance, you should not have come.
Aïe! Grandpa!
- I tripped, Olivier.
- Come, come. Come, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Just give me a hand.
Serves me right for playing the young man.
There.
I'm breathing better and I'll be alright.
We still have... 2 km uphill.
The road will be easier after that.
And what if it's m'sieur Privat?
We'll say hi anyway.
- But he tried to kill my parents!
- So what? You don't fire a gun at people without a reason.
Have you ever asked yourself why he did that?
Grandpa! It's Uncle Victor.
That's a different matter.
- You think I don't see through this?
You'll never get to the sanatorium before nightfall.
It's madness. What do you mean?
Is it madness to want to see my grandson?
- You're the one that's crazy!
- I might be crazy... but you're turning around and I come with you.
And you, Olivier, don't try that again or I'll bust your ass.
And not a word to your grandma, she'll gouge your eyes out.
I bought a 6 lb ham at Fayet's.
Let's go.
You see, the word solitude, it only takes one "l" .
Because it's all alone, you see!
You didn't conjugate correctly the past tense of the verb "shoot".
Tell me why! Because it's an exception. It's an irregular verb.
Then why couldn't you get that right? I forgot.
On top of that you misspelled the proper name of the bandit.
If you work hard, you'll soon become an ace.
But... when you go back to school, you'll have to go back to Paris.
- But, grandpa... - It's sad to say, but nowadays, the future of youth lies within the cities.
It breaks my heart to say it because, as you know, I would love it if you could stay here with me.
I would love to stay here with you too. Don't be silly!
After a few months, you'd get bored.
No. I'm happy, here.
I'm happy like... - Like...
- Like with your mother?
So much the better.
You should join your grannie out in the fields.
Today, she's at Devil's Abyss.
You know where that is?
What will grannie say? You'll soon find out.
Don't forget to greet the folks you encounter.
Here people talk to each other.
"Parlez-moi d'amour
"Redites-moi des choses tendres
"Votre beau discours... "Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre
Besides, you wanted to kill my parents!
You said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you!
But you fired a gun at them.
That's why you went to jail!
It's your aunt who told you that?
Let me tell you what happened.
I don't want to hear it.
Leave me alone!
What are you up to, Olivier?
You came directly?
No, I swear it, grannie.
- Did you meet anyone on the way? - No.
Actually, yes. I saw Louison Flandin.
He asked me to go to a soccer game with him.
- I told him I was coming to see you.
- Very well, then.
Good. Well, I'm off to see the cows.
What are you doing?
You can tell you're from Paris!
Cows don't care for sugar. They like salt!
Give the sugar to the dog.
It's not good for his eyes, but over here, we don't let anything go to waste.
Here, doggy, come boy.
Good, huh? That's good.
How can you tell when it's time to go back to the farm, then?
Look at the shadow cast by the shed.
When it reaches the boulder, it's time to bring the cows home.
Looks like you have a heat stroke. Go freshen up at the river.
- The river looks pretty deep.
- "Devil's Abyss"?
- A long time ago, there was a man who bragged about not believing in either God or Devil.
Well, the poor bastard got his punishment.
The river swallowed him.
- Really? - Obviously! He made a point to come and work here on the Lord's Day.
One stormy day, as he was driving his cart along the banks, he surely came too close to the precipice.
Then the two hands of the Devil lunged from the river, his long claws grasped him fiercely so he couldn't move, and down he went to the bottom with his two horses!
- That's not true. It's a legend. - You're like your grandfather.
Climb up on the rock... and bend over the precipice.
You'll see the remains of the cart at the bottom!
- See it?
- Not sure.
The water isn't clear.
Look again!
Ah yes! I see it.
I see the cart with bones and a skeleton!
Did you notice, grannie?
The shadow has set on the boulder.
Well done, you're a fast learner.
Soon, you'll be able to lead the cows to the pasture all by yourself.
If you like. Here.
Take my stick and lead them toward the trail.
Go on! We'll see how well you do.
Come on cows! Let's go.
Where are you going, Poumérade?
It's pretty obvious you pealed chunks off her hoof.
I'm not selling her to you. (Speaking Patois)
Patois with a Parisian accent. Very comical.
He's making progress in this area too!
- Olivier! It's great that you can now smith, but you can't neglect your studies.
Wait!
We're not done yet.
An automobile!
She did well for herself, our Victoria.
That's for sure.
She went to Paris and Paris went to her head.
She's ashamed of us.
She avoids telling her friends that we are blacksmiths. Instead, she says we're ironwork artists.
I think being a blacksmith is a more noble trade.
You plan to stay with us?
No, no. I came in like the wind, just to drop off Julienne.
I thought you dropped in to say hi.
That too, of course.
My God; this heat! Tell me,
Marceau, my grandson.
How's he doing?
His condition is stable the doctors tell me.
But they may have to perform a thoraco.
- A thoracoplasty.
It's an operation consisting of compressing the diseased lung by removing some ribs.
- In his case, 6.
- That's terrible!
- Are you going back? - No.
He's asked us to leave.
One-eyed bitch!
I would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health.
Children should not have to suffer. And how is your leg doing?
A bit of pain, that's all.
The real burden is inaction. Lucky for me, I have Olivier.
- He seems well acclimatised. - Yes.
He's very happy, here.
But you must take him back to Paris.
Oh no.
That's out of the question!
Victoria!
I am your father. This is my home. I'm in charge.
And you'll listen to me, for God's sake!
I worked with him almost every day.
He's a very bright boy.
He's inquisitive, devours books.
With a bit of help, he'll become someone.
He must be allowed to further his studies.
You have no right to condemn him to ignorance.
Sometimes I wonder if perhaps I wasn't too hard on him.
Well, speak of the devil. - Good day, aunt.
- I am happy to see you again.
- Likewise, aunt.
Your grandfather tells me you like it here.
Yes, aunt.
You know what would make him happy?
- Going up to see Marceau.
- That won't happen.
It's true! Show her the letter.
Your aunt was clear: he doesn't want to see anyone.
He's was cruel toward me, this morning.
- I'm sure he'll want to see me.
- Listen,
Victoria, it would do Marceau a lot of good!
Well.
If you're ready in 5 minutes, I'll drop you off at the sanatorium.
There is an evening coach.
- Thank you, aunt. - Remember: 5 minutes! - I'll be ready.
- Hey!
Olivier, before you go, drink a bit of wine and chew on some garlic.
It will give you strength.
And repel evil.
Guillaume, please! Stop the car at the next curve.
Marceau is lost, Olivier.
The doctors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope.
You must not tell anyone. Do you understand?
- I swear, aunt. Ah!
My God.
It's not fair!
He suffers immensely.
You'll see, he's changed.
But he mustn't find out.
Anyway, who knows.
Perhaps there is still a chance.
I'm sure of it, my aunt.
I'm sure of it.
I don't have the courage.
He's inside that building.
Room 18. Second floor.
You'll have to sneak in, children are not allowed.
Don't worry.
Thank you, aunt.
I know you. You're his cousin.
You can't stay here. He's not in his room.
He's outside, in the solarium.
- Go on!
- Thanks.
- It's you, my little outcast.
I knew you would come.
- How did you get here? - Your mother brought me.
You see, the Divine isn't that bad.
Have a seat.
By the way, bravo for the stunt you pulled at the college.
Your letter cracked me up. A work of art!
How are you feeling?
I hope you didn't come for a medical report.
It boils down to one word: irrecoverable.
That's not true.
After your operation, things will improve.
That's right...
Hope that everything will go well after losing half your ribs!
I must admit, I'm a little pessimistic.
You see, Olivier.
I would have preferred dying in New York.
Or on the bridge of a transatlantic.
Much better than here, don't you think?
Olivier, I beg you.
You remember...?
The concert by Louis Armstrong?
We share so many memories you and I.
We do indeed!
Grandpa embraces you warmly.
Tell him I'm doing well.
How is he?
His leg still hurts.
You know, we almost succeeded to come see you.
- We were forced to turn back, though.
- Darn Escoulas, hasn't changed a bit.
Well, here comes my guardian angel.
As you can see, I have nothing to complain about.
I was rude with Julienne this morning.
I would like you to watch over her. Extend her the love I was incapable of giving her.
Okay? - Do you promise?
- I promise, Marceau.
Alright, time to go.
And please...
- Don't come back to see me.
- Why? - Please.
- You can't stay, Olivier.
I told you already.
Children are not allowed.
Don't be angry with him.
You'll see, you'll like it up here.
This is the best mattress ever.
So put your mind at rest.
Have you seen these old books?
"Le Tour de la France by two children".
- Of course it's good. With that I learned to read to my wife.
- May I open it?
Look at this beautiful medal.
It was your father's. With palms.
And what's this?
Belongs to my daughter.
- Aunt Victoria?
- Yes.
Long ago, with only an orange, you could celebrate Christmas Eve.
Oh yes! Back then, we didn't have the luxury of going... to the hospital in a carriage.
Life was really harsh... and money was hard to come by. We would fight over it.
Have you seen this funny boot?
All bloated and with an enormous sole.
That shoe belonged to your dad.
You see, we send boys to their death before they can experience life.
Your poor father.
When he came back to this country, after he was injured,
I didn't recognize him. All I could say was: "There you are".
He wept.
He walked between two crutches, still bore shrapnel in his skin,
his lungs burnt by the gas.
To think he was once as swift as a squirrel, only to stagger into a cloud.
He would raise his eyes, as if to prepare an answer, but he said nothing.
Your mother restored his taste for life.
Just enough time to make a little darling.
And now he's gone.
I can't sleep.
Marceau is always on my mind.
It is so unfair.
We were planning on getting married.
I would do anything for him to be cured.
Don't worry.
Soon, he'll be well again.
He told me that even if he was to recover, he would no longer marry me.
He said that only because he doesn't want to leave you with any regrets. - You think so?
- I'm sure.
This illness has really changed him.
Besides, there's this other girl, the nurse.
Don't cry, Julienne. Don't.
You know, he doesn't really care about Charlotte.
- I don't know.
I don't know anymore. - It's true!
He told me.
Don't worry.
Kiss me, Olivier.
Not like that, you idiot.
Marceau!
- Not really, no.
I think I'll go back to Paris.
I thought you were going to stay here a few days.
I'm too close to Marceau, here.
Victor?
Would you mind taking me to the station?
I'm really busy with work, you know. Olivier could take you.
He can steer a buggy.
You must not loiter on the way.
You will come home right after.
- You know, I can go by myself. - No.
A young girl should never travel alone.
He's right.
By the way, the other day in Langeac, I saw a used wireless.
- For a good price. - No music in my house!
Why not?
- A bit of music, here and there.
- No, no.
Novelties are bearers of misfortune.
It seems you like to dwell in it.
You don't want water springing from a pipe, so you carry a bucket.
You don't want music that could uplift our spirits.
You can't live in the past or among the dead forever, mother.
I can live with mine, thank you.
Line 24, arriving from Puy-en-Velay, en route to Paris via Clermont-Ferrand, Immediate departure, platform 1.
It was sweet of you to accompany me, Olivier.
We'll meet again in Paris, some day?
Victor was right, it's a pity you are leaving.
- We were happy together.
- You're a sweetie. - Marceau asked me to watch over you.
- And you've succeeded nicely.
Are you crazy, you little pervert!
- What's the matter? The other night... - Quiet!
Warm-blooded, just like your mother.
- You have no right to say that!
- Oh yeah?
How do you call a woman who had lovers?
None of your business.
She did as she pleased.
Victoria said your mother was a small-time goddess.
It's not her fault if Privat tried to shoot her.
Not her fault? Well there's a good one!
Why do you say that?
My poor Olivier!
If you only knew what your mother did to Privat.
What did she do to him?
- Tell me, Julienne! - I can't tell you.
Attention, now departing.
Go and see Privat.
He lives on a big estate called Les Bruyères.
He'll tell you what really happened.
We'll meet again.
Later.
Giddy-up!
Come on, faster!
Giddy-up!
Hue, Nono!
Easy, easy, Nono.
Whoa!
I'd like to speak to Mr. Privat.
It's very important. Yes, I see.
He shouldn't be long.
You can wait in the living room.
Follow me.
It's your mother, Olivier.
A friend of mine made that bust.
She was about to turn 18.
I thought you wouldn't want to see me again.
I didn't come for you.
I need to know something.
- It's very important.
- I'm listening.
Why did you want to kill my parents.
What did they do to you?
I was your... your mother's first husband. My mother's first husband?
Your mother couldn't bring herself to tell you she was divorced. She didn't want you troubled by that.
We got married before the war.
We were living together and then I was called to the front.
At the same time your father was.
We were childhood friends, all three of us.
When he got injured, in October of 1914, and was released from duty, your mother took care of him.
I thought they met when father came back wounded from the war? No. No.
But your mother was indeed his nurse.
Months and years went by.
Then one day, I received a disheartening letter... from your mother. She was leaving for Paris, with your father.
- It's not true.
You're lying! - No.
You'll be the only one to know the truth.
A truth I have never revealed. To anyone.
Upon reading the letter, I was shattered, forlorn.
I wanted to find your mother.
In the spring of 1917, during General Nivell's offensives,
I had volunteered to perform inspections on a fort we had retaken.
I picked up a grenade, unpinned it, then I pushed my arm through a gun slit,
and held it until my arm blew off.
That's how I became a war hero.
Weeks later, I left the hospital and headed for Paris.
With the intent of killing your parents, and turning the gun on myself. There it is.
Olivier!
- I hope you'll forgive me.
- My parents would never have done that!
It's not their fault, Olivier. It's the war that created this mess.
This can't be true.
I will never forgive them!
They're no longer my mother nor my father!
You have no right to judge them!
You'll understand this later on.
It is possible to love... and then no longer love.
We're not masters...
- Shut up!
Olivier!
Move on, Nono! Move on!
Giddy-up!
Giddy-up!
Giddy-up!
Olivier! Charlotte?
What's going on? It's Marceau?
Marceau?
No. Don't worry.
He's over there, in the car.
How is he?
They wouldn't let him go out, but he persuaded the director. He wanted to see you.
They will operate tomorrow.
You'll see.
He's weakened, but keeps in good spirits.
So, my little outcast? - You're now a shepherd?
- You're crazy, Marceau.
You should be resting!
But I am resting, here.
Don't say anything to your grandpa?
Let him cherish the image of a young man in perfect health, rather than one of deterioration.
Besides, I came for you.
I got your letter.
I needed to talk to you..
- You didn't have to come. - I know that.
I wanted to ask you something.
What is it?
You must forgive your parents, Olivier.
Do not judge them, as I often did with mine.
Since I've been living with death, I find these judgments so ludicrous.
Your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them? No.
- But look at what they did to Mr. Privat!
- It's all the same.
The love they had for each other... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same medal.
You cannot split them apart.
Do you understand?
Remember, Olivier.
One day, you said that my life and death wouldn't have meaning just for me.
So now, I want you to trust me.
It's the last time...
You're crazy, Marceau!
We'll see each other after the operation!
Don't be silly.
Do what I say.
Promised?
I know you're going back to school in Paris.
But before you go, I want you to visit your parents' grave.
And tell them that you love them.
How can I tell them?
If you put your heart into it, they'll hear you.
Really?
Yes.
I have a book on the language of flowers.
I'll offer them a rose.
A red rose.
It's a symbol of love.
Crazy love.
Bravo.
You see, when you want to.
Now, now.
Don't start that again.
We'll see each other again!
We'll travel to America.
We'll go cheer Louis Armstrong at the Cotton Club.
We'll have a great time!
- What do you say, my Olive?
- Let's do it!
Courage, my little urchin!
You old fart!
I'm the editor of "L'Illustration."
I'm here for Odilon Hubert, the Algerian MP.
He's over there.
Thank you.
Mr. Hubert?
I'm Camille Bruyère.
As the first man to represent Frenchmen in Algeria, my newspaper would like to devote an article to you.
- About Algeria?
- No, about you.
About me?
A Shakespearean tragedy with blood and violence?
Our readers love that, sir.
Is that so?
It's another country, young man. Another world. A land of extremes.
Scalding days, freezing nights. The choking smell of goat and jasmine.
Let me take notes.
It's about other religions and peoples.
It's about Arabs, fanatical Muslim warriors who only love horses and arms.
That's great.
How will you explain to your readers the new race of French settlers, the truly exotic mix of Corsicans, people from the Rouergue, the Ariège, the Spaniards, Jews and Maltese?
Let's give it a try and start at the beginning.
When did you get to Algeria?
I arrived in Oran in 1837 with my friend Hélie Toussaint.
I was a medical officer and he was an interpreter.
Algeria was a world filled with wild dreams.
Everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this newly conquered land.
We'd been fighting for 7 years.
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 1.
THE EMIR'S DOCTOR
He's the guy on the black stallion.
And I, Jean-Baptiste Frémond, will get Abd el-Kader!
The colonel wanted you to see the interior of Algeria.
You'll have your fill.
Wait for my signal to shoot.
I've been in the field for 3 years and I haven't killed a single Arab yet!
If you shoot, you'll get court martialed!
Crap!
Shit!
The sly old dog!
Curse your mother's religion!
Let him die, Doc!
Take care of our wounded.
- He's a man like you and me.
- Maybe like you, not me.
You're naïve.
You won't live long if you keep this up.
Hey interpreter, ask this guy where they spent the night.
Who gave them food and shelter?
Tell him I'll shoot him in the head if he lies.
- Témouchent. - Shit!
- Let's go.
- What about him?
Bring him.
I'll show him what I'm made of.
Breteuil!
Dumas!
Shit!
Savages!
Burn that damn village!
Set the whole town ablaze!
Cut down the trees!
Burn their crops!
Those brutes must die!
- Take them all!
- Even the women?
I said "them all," Lieutenant!
Women and children too! - Why the women?
- Arabs buy and sell women like cattle.
The ugly ones become slaves.
They invented razzias, Lieutenant, not us.
The only thing Arabs respect is strength.
That's the only thing those fanatics understand.
Strength.
Imagine our despair.
Hélie and I were Saint-Simonians.
We hadn't come to Algeria for this, but to unite the East and the West like we'd sworn to do a few months earlier in Paris.
You are now brothers through Saint-Simon. Apostles of a new Christianity.
We Saint-Simonians, who follow the teachings of our master, the late Count of Saint-Simon, a remarkable economist and philosopher, want to build a new society based on progress.
Engineers, polytechnicians and bankers, we'll spread our message around the world.
Let's leave for Africa, for the Regency of Algiers over which the French flag now flies.
Let's all swear to unite the East's spiritual values with the material ones of the West.
We swear!
We swear!
Hello, Ferdinand.
Mother, you know Ferdinand de Lesseps.
Mr. de Lesseps.
He's going to Egypt with Father Enfantin to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.
A canal?
What ever for?
So India-bound boats won't need to go around Africa.
Those are the Pereire brothers, very rich bankers.
Mother, this is my friend Hélie Toussaint.
We're going to Algeria together.
He's an interpreter and I'll act as medical officer in Oran.
We'll build a new world over there, Madam.
All men will be equal, regardless of race or religion.
On the Barbary Coast! My God!
Have a seat, Mother.
Excuse me.
- I don't know that friend. - He's a new one.
Allow me to congratulate you, Mrs. Hubert.
Your son Odilon is a good boy and a zealous apostle of our Saint-Simonian cause.
- I fear for him, sir.
- Why is that?
You're sending him to Algeria, a war- and cholera-ridden land.
Of course.
But it's an exciting mission:
To wake up slumbering Islam and create a new society.
My only son with Arabs!
- We're to meet the colonel.
- He's busy at the moment.
- We'll wait here.
- As you wish.
Did you know Colonel Lamoricière was Saint-Simonian too?
I'm not surprised.
He went to the Polytechnique, so he must be in favor of progress.
- Goodbye, Mr. Bensimon. - Goodbye.
Interpreter Hélie Toussaint.
Medical officer, Major Odilon Hubert.
At ease.
I know.
Father Enfantin told me about your coming to Algeria.
Welcome to this beautiful country where much remains to be done.
Follow me.
I'll brief you.
We're occupying the ports of Algiers, Bône and Oran.
Our only intention, at first, was to occupy the coastline, like the Turks.
That isn't what we saw when we arrived, Colonel.
This is clearly a war to conquer and exterminate the Arabs.
I know.
Some Parisian newspapers wrote that we're more barbarian than the barbarians.
They're unfortunately right.
But whose fault is it?
Abd el-Kader has started a holy war against us.
He swore to throw us into the sea.
He's waged a vast, cruel and ruthless war against us.
We did invade his land.
We're dealing with religions fanatics! We have to dominate them, or they'll drive us out and the British will take our place.
The French government doesn't know what it wants.
Ten governor-generals in 6 years!
We don't have enough men to end this once and for all.
Barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million Arabs in a country 3 times the size of France.
It's ridiculous!
Yet, the Saint-Simonian mission is clear:
We want to help the Arabs, to protect their language and their religion. We wish to let them run their own country and help them gradually take in the values of modern Western civilization.
Excuse me, Colonel...
How is that different from colonization?
The land, Toussaint.
The land.
We need to leave it to the Arabs who are its rightful farmers.
Our role is to build factories, roads and railroads.
That's why I created the first Arab offices in this land and why I set up the first Zouave regiment, made up of Muslim volunteers who are now our brothers in arms.
I would like to volunteer in such a regiment.
Not now.
I have more important work for you.
Bugeaud will be in Oran next week. His mission is to seek peace with Abd el-Kader.
You speak Arabic, Toussaint?
I can pass for Egyptian.
Very well.
You'll remain incognito in the native city.
There, you'll contact Abd el-Kader's man.
You want me to spy on the Arabs?
No, we're doing it for peace, for a good cause.
As for you, Hubert, you'll handle the cholera epidemic, which has hit our troops very hard.
- And the population even harder.
- I know. Hubert will treat everyone equally.
Be careful, Doctor.
The other doctors before you all died of cholera.
- What about you, Sister?
- God is watching over me.
Leila?
This is Leila, one of our orphans.
- She speaks Arabic and French.
- Hello, Miss.
Hello, Doctor.
He's dehydrated.
Tell him to drink a lot. Boiled water.
No need to be so formal with me.
I can teach you Arabic.
He needs a new bandage.
I will be chaperoning your lessons with Leila.
Why, Sister?
Don't you trust me?
I need to learn Arabic too.
Your convent's been here over 200 years - and you don't speak Arabic?
- I need the theory.
Cover him up.
He's in a sorry state.
I'm discouraged, Doctor. They keep dying.
I pray every day, but...
Medicine is making progress.
We now know it spreads through water.
We'll find a cure.
Try turpentine.
Your protégé is great!
When the poor girl was little, Arabs killed her parents before her eyes.
Her family's from Spain.
But she looks and speaks Arabic.
Her grandmother was a "mamma Rosa."
A long time ago, a boat with 10 of our Spanish sisters ran aground here.
Our sisters were all sold as slaves to Kabyle and Turkish chiefs.
The mother superior was named Maria Rosa, so the offspring of those forced marriages were named "mamma Rosas."
You shouldn't laugh.
- Forgive me, Sister.
- We raised Leila as one of our own.
Tell him children have to drink a lot.
- He said, "May Allah bless you."
- Get a stretcher.
Hurry!
Want a woman?
You had that one yesterday.
She's no longer a virgin.
Let me in. Let me in!
- What're you doing here?
- You'll blow my cover.
Everyone knows who you are.
I came to see for myself that you're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission.
That's not true.
The colonel told me to blend in, so I am.
You've no idea what delights the East has to offer.
Everything is here to please men.
These women have been raised to fulfill our every desire.
Odilon, I'm uniting with the East on a daily basis.
- Want to try?
- Have you lost your mind?
You'll come around.
This isn't quite the spiritual union our Saint-Simonian brothers had in mind.
The colonel sent me.
He hasn't heard from you in over a month.
You risk getting court martialed.
I found a way to contact Abd el-Kader.
Trust me.
Stay.
Special tricks, huh?
I know who you are.
So do I.
Why are you spying on us?
I'm not spying.
I'm bringing peace.
We also seek peace.
But peace is worth nothing without freedom.
France is willing to respect your freedom. - If you stop the war. - It's not up to me.
- Tell your leader.
- Only Allah has the power - to decide
- I know.
Allah has a lot of responsibilities.
- I'm sure he could use our help.
- I'll do my best.
- Tell me about Bahia.
- She's beautiful.
- I know.
I saw her.
- She's nice.
- Haven't you had enough women?
- She's different.
I'm Bahia.
My father, Si Kaddour, sent me to tell you Emir Abd el-Kader, the leader of the holy war, is ready to broker peace.
Thank you.
You've brought me great news.
You speak French well.
My father didn't have a son, so he taught me to read and write like a boy.
I have to go.
That means "I love you."
- Excuse me?
- Right.
- It could be useful.
Yes.
But more sensuous.
Yes, again.
Hello, everyone!
I have great news!
- Any new developments?
- I'm in love.
Crazy in love!
What do you think?
It's not what you think, Odilon.
This is serious.
She's from a big tent. - Excuse me?
- From a noble family.
She's beautiful, smart...
- Who is she?
- Si Kaddour's daughter.
- Bahia?
- You know her?
Very well.
We studied together.
That's fantastic, Leila!
You can help me.
Go tell her I love her and want to marry her.
- You want to marry an...
- An Arab.
So?
I won't be the first.
The wife of the general in Constantine is Arab.
No, she's Kabyle.
Leila...
You know her, so go see her and tell her I love her.
Please. I beg you! Do it for me.
Arranging marriages is for old women.
She's your friend, she'll listen to you.
Fine, I'll play matchmaker.
Just for you!
- And your mission?
- That's the other good news.
Abd el-Kader is ready to negotiate.
I notified Lamoricière, who informed Bugeaud.
- There's going to be a truce.
- You don't know Arabs.
It's a ruse. They'll keep fighting.
You're one to talk, Leila.
Aren't you Arab?
Not at all. I'm Kabyle.
I'm not Muslim, but Christian.
Anyway... religion is all that matters here.
It's more important than blood, more important than anything!
You think he really loves me?
He's been with so many women.
Do you love him? I don't know.
My father wants to give me to a friend of his.
He may be the love of your life.
All I know is I want to be his wife - and bear his children.
- Sounds like love.
You know it's up to the men.
My father won't let me marry an infidel.
That can be arranged.
He adores you.
I don't even know if Odilon loves me.
I had to kiss him.
Go see old Zara for a love potion.
We already have one: this, - this and this.
- Leila, you sound like a whore. That's what we are!
Fathers sell us like sheep.
Don't say that.
Women serve men and bear their children.
I'll choose my own husband.
- I've already chosen.
- You love him?
I want him. I'll get him.
So?
She loves you.
She'll marry you on one condition.
- Anything!
- She can only marry a Muslim.
- That doesn't bode well.
- There's a way:
Become Muslim.
Why not?
Go see the Imam, say, "Allah is great, "Muhammad is his prophet" and it's done!
Why not?
I've already thought about it.
Islam is a good religion.
No priests, no bishops, no pope.
Just you and God.
Anyway, it's the same God for everyone.
Yes, but... circumcision?
Circumcision.
Don't worry.
The barber will give your willy a clean cut.
Plus, he uses an English shaver.
Sure you want to get circumcised?
I have to to become Muslim.
Let me do it instead of that butcher.
He's not a butcher, he's a barber.
That's worse.
You don't know the words that need to be said.
I'm giving a part of myself to God.
Want me to go with you?
Hélie!
I envied him in a way.
He threw himself into everything, while I, the good Jesuit student, weighed the pros and cons for so long, I'd never decide.
Should I marry Leila?
She was beautiful and bewitching, but she scared me like this country did.
Done.
- We're brothers now.
- Go!
The brute had to do it 3 times!
Told you so.
I'll bandage you at the hospital.
I'm Muslim like you, Si Kaddour.
You gave me your word.
"I'll give you my daughter if you become Muslim."
Will you give her to me now?
I gave you my word, so I will. As long as the uncles agree.
What's it to them?
They're the elders, wise men.
They decide for the family.
It's tradition.
Are you circumcised?
What I wouldn't do for you, Bahia...
So, are you done inspecting me?
They agree.
I'm grateful.
You can have Bahia, but there's the dowry.
The dowry.
How much?
- 1,000 francs.
- Alright.
And 50 sheep.
Fifty sheep?
Where would I find those?
Buy them.
From whom?
Me.
If you want to.
- Congratulations! - Thanks.
Bugeaud signed a peace treaty with Abd el-Kader.
The Treaty of Tafna recognizes his authority over 2/3 of Algeria.
The emir set up his camp on the Tagdempt plateau, between Mascara and the Ouarsenis mountains.
I'm worried, Hubert.
Why, Colonel?
You wanted everyone to stay where they belonged.
I hear he's a loyal fellow.
He can't stand our presence on Muslim ground.
It's a question of religion, which is sacred.
Don't forget, Hubert, that the emir is a prophet as well as a military man and a poet.
Only Islam is capable of producing such men.
We sent him a delegation.
He requested a doctor to treat his sick mother.
I appointed you.
Go to him. Try to get in his good graces and keep me apprised each week.
You can count on me, Colonel.
Enjoy your dinner, last night?
Yes, Colonel.
On behalf of my master, Emir Abd el-Kader, prince of the faithful, defender of the Prophet's religion, welcome.
On behalf of France and science, I came to help the emir and his family.
Our emir is sad.
His mother, the holy and revered Zohra, is seriously ill.
If you cure her, he'll shower you with gifts.
I don't need gifts.
Your master's gratitude will be ample reward.
- She's burning up!
- It often happens to her.
It's malaria.
- Then it's up to God.
- There's a new medication:
quinine.
I prepared a potion with Quina bark.
Careful. It's quite bitter.
She must take a sip every 2 hours.
I'll be back tomorrow.
This is your house.
Just ask if you need anything.
The emir will see you tomorrow morning.
I'll come get you.
Rest in peace.
Go see the French doc. You'll do his cooking and cleaning.
The doctor is a spy.
Watch his every move.
Bring me anything that he writes.
Got it?
What will you give me for that?
Like she said, your uncle wants me for his harem.
Your uncle's rich.
I'll find you a husband.
Young or old, but rich.
You're pretty, you'll get your pick.
Who are these prisoners?
The leaders of a rebel tribe.
The Ben Zetoun.
Welcome to my home.
Have a seat.
I'm happy that French science could serve the mother of the prince of the faithful.
It's a good example of what we can bring your country.
Medicine was invented by an Arab.
I plan on setting up a university.
Our doctors will be as good as French ones.
Why waste time when France offered you to skip centuries and enter the modern world.
A new world could come out of the union of the East and the West.
Arabs weren't made to sow wheat and build cities.
- We're nomads, sons of the wind.
- Nothing solid is built on wind.
Nothing solid is built without God.
God is with me. I only listen to Him.
He forbids me from letting any Muslim live - under Christian domination.
- We don't want to dominate you, but to bring you the benefits of civilization and progress.
When God wants to hurt an ant, He gives it wings.
Full of pride and joy, it takes to the sky.
Then a little bird sees it and swallows it.
We'll be friends if everyone stays where they belong.
We value freedom! Only a holy war can bring freedom and independence.
A holy war never required anyone butchering their enemy, like I saw at Aïn Témouchent.
We've made peace.
Come see me whenever you please.
You'll be welcome wherever I am.
This is from the emir.
It's yours.
I can't accept it.
Refusing a gift is a grave insult.
- Who's she?
- A servant for you.
- Where's my servant Ahmed?
- He asked to join the army of the faithful.
Naouel's a better cook.
Naouel.
You speak French?
Where are you from?
Kabylia.
My father worked for a French lieutenant at the Arab office.
The emir's soldiers came to our village.
They killed the lieutenant,...
Don't worry, I'll treat you well.
You're my father and mother to me.
Good night.
Where will you sleep?
- Next door.
- There's no bed.
I sleep on the floor.
Call me if you need anything.
Wait.
Stay a while.
You smell nice.
Let me guess...
Close your eyes.
Good morning.
So, the coffee's Turkish, the milk is from a goat, but the bread is mine.
Happy?
- Don't kiss me like that.
- You're my master, I'm yours.
This is:
Naouel was the mistress-servant every man secretly dreams of.
I dove head first into the bewitching world of Islam, which mixed nobility, poetry and cruelty, and where God commanded every move.
I was far from everything, elsewhere. I never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life.
The emir had just come back from a long expedition in the Sahara.
You were right, Colonel.
He's been taking advantage, these last 2 years, of the false peace to rule over the other tribes.
He's plundered the Kabylia, the Ouarsenis, the Titteri and now the Sahara.
Will he ever unite these dispersed tribes?
If he does, it'll be in spite of us.
The women at the souk are saying the war with the French is about to start again.
I'm scared.
If there's a war, you'll leave without me.
Of course not.
I'll take you with me.
There's a rumor that hostilities will resume against the French.
The emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infantry,
2,000 cavalry, 20 field guns, and 240 gunners.
Add to that, 60,000 irregulars armed with French rifles they got off our dead or from their prisoners, and English guns the British consul sold them.
Odilon?
Hélie?
- I'm so happy to see you!
- So am I. How are you?
Well.
Have a seat.
- Three stripes!
Bravo!
- Same to you.
Haven't you heard? You've been promoted.
This is such a remote place.
- Hey! She's stealing a letter!
- No, it's Naouel.
She brings my letters to the legation.
Your servant?
- You trust her?
- Of course. Well, she's more than my servant.
She's my girlfriend.
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm in love.
Good thing I'm here.
You're so naïve, Odilon.
She's here to spy on you.
That's what the Arabs do!
Can we talk about something else?
What brings you here?
I'm here with the major.
We came to see Abd el-Kader to prevent a new outbreak.
What's going on?
Our generals have captured Constantine.
To join Algiers and Constantine, they occupied a territory Abd el-Kader thinks is his.
Is he right?
We're obviously being dishonest.
So are the Arabs.
Abd el-Kader keeps saying that God willing, he'll throw the French into the sea.
After all, this is his land not ours.
If we leave, Algeria will go back to chaos.
What about the union of the East and the West?
We need peace first.
And freedom and equality for Arabs. Not a forced union.
Winning is all our generals want.
They want to subdue the natives.
Believe me, you should head back to Oran.
- Leila is waiting for you.
- How's Bahia?
I forgot to tell you. I have a son.
- Really?
- Ishmael.
He's almost a year old.
I hope you'll attend his circumcision.
I wouldn't miss it.
The French didn't keep their word.
The duke of Orléans and Marshal Valée crossed the Iron Gates and violated my territory.
It's an affront to our dignity.
I wrote to Louis-Philippe, the king of France.
He didn't even reply.
My men are in favor of a holy war.
The hissing of bullets is worth more than freshwater.
That would be a mistake.
France is stronger.
It has soldiers, canons, ships.
I am not scared.
Allah is with me.
My friends and I want freedom and equality for every Algerian and French person.
Perhaps, but it's your generals who lay down the law.
Winning is like saltwater, the more you drink,
- the thirstier you get.
- No matter who wins, a lot of men will fall under enemy fire.
It's fate, not bullets, that kill.
Muslims are ready to die for their faith.
The Koran says, "Heaven lies in the shade of swords."
I chose the honorable path: war.
Warn your people, so they can't say they weren't given fair warning.
Hadj Hamou will take you to the French outpost.
May Allah watch over you and your family.
I'll never forget you saved my mother.
May Allah guide you towards fair and honorable peace.
Farewell.
Naouel?
- Where's Naouel?
- She's gone.
- Where?
- Back to the harem.
What?
She's leaving with me.
You can't expect a Muslim to follow an infidel.
- I want to see her.
- She doesn't want to see you.
You're lying!
She wants to leave with me.
You're naïve, Lieutenant Hubert.
I sent her here to spy on you.
I don't believe you.
You're lying.
She showed me all your letters.
"8,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 20 field guns."
You're well informed.
Get over it.
You're a soldier.
You should know that a man who trusts a woman isn't a real man.
Fight me!
You're the emir's guest.
He ordered me to see to your safety.
Hospitality is sacred to Muslims.
You're my guest.
I have to protect you.
- I owe you my life.
- I'll kill you next time.
...with sugar, milk, dates and raisins is a delight!
- Leila will be eating with us.
- I see, it's a conspiracy.
You should make up your mind.
She's perfect for you.
- Don't you like her?
- Of course I do.
So marry her!
Don't be like every single officer here who shacks up with a broad, but won't be seen in public with her.
Sorry, I... You're right.
It's all in the past.
- Let's talk shop.
Excuse me, I must take care of Ishmael.
I'll join you.
Leila, I wanted to tell you...
What?
Firstly... I have something to confess.
The Kabyle girl?
I know.
Hélie told me.
He should mind his own business.
It's different between us, isn't it?
So you'd be willing to...
Ladies and gentlemen, I raise my glass to Captain Hubert who just earned a well-deserved third stripe. To his lovely wife, our hospital's head nurse, whose beauty and competence will support her husband's brilliant career.
Our best wishes to the newlyweds.
Their union is celebrated under favorable auspices.
Our troops just crushed the regular army of Abd el-Kader, who wanted to challenge us to a battle.
But in vain.
His troops were annihilated, thanks to my friend, Colonel Yusuf.
Ladies and gentlemen, to love and victory!
You're very optimistic, General.
Abd el-Kader has lost the battle but not the war.
He started a guerilla war and is stirring up the tribes.
Here and there, perhaps.
But trust me, he lost face and therefore the game.
It's only a question of time now.
Bugeaud was named governor-general.
He's bringing 100,000 men.
We'll be able to pull out all the stops.
Things are clear to Paris.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
We'll turn it into a modern country.
What are they doing?
- How do you like it?
- It's sublime.
- Thank you.
- Want something to drink? - Two granitas.
- Two granitas, please.
- Where did you get that?
- In a Jewish store.
- It suits you.
- Thank you.
I prefer North African dresses. They're more mysterious.
Eroticism relies on mystery.
Is it true that Abd el-Kader is 20 km from Algiers?
He was. He raided the Mitidja and vanished without a trace.
We haven't seen the last of him.
This morning, we met the royal committee for the development of Algeria.
There'll be a railroad from Algiers to Blida.
The mineralogical map says we have coal...
We're late, Odilon.
We're expected at noon.
Your kepi.
- Wait for us for lunch. - Yes.
Good day to you, Sir.
Colonization is at a standstill.
What's the use of conquering land if no one settles there?
No one wants to settle on a foreign land that hasn't been completely pacified.
It will be, Lamoricière, it will be!
I swear we'll take out the trash by any means necessary!
But I won't do it for Swiss or Austrian settlers! Those ignorant drunks!
You're right, General.
To make the most out of these huge areas the nomadic Arabs have neglected, we need big capitalist companies who possess great means.
We recommend it, as the modern and effective way.
Fiddlesticks!
That's typical of your Saint-Simonian friends.
A bunch of dreamers and visionaries!
You see, Lamoricière, I haven't been to the Polytechnique, unlike yourself.
I'm a soldier and a farmer.
I learned everything on my Limousin farm.
The Mitidja isn't the Beauce.
May I respectfully point out, General, that the Limousin isn't the Mitidja either.
Believe it or not, Captain Toussaint, I had noticed that.
"Ense et aratro." It's my motto.
With the sword and plow.
Like Cincinnatus, the Roman farmer-soldier. Veterans can settle here after their service is done:
plow, horse, rifle.
I'll even give them wives.
Natives?
My chief of staff, who's retired, is now the mayor of Toulon.
He can get me servants, widows, single women... You catch my drift.
Germaine, do you take Gustave to be your husband, to be faithful unto him and be part of the Church?
- I do.
- Gustave, do you take Germaine to be your wife, to be faithful unto her and be part of the Church?
- You are now joined in holy matrimony.
Here are your rings.
Poor girl.
- I hear she's an orphan.
- Who knows, she might be happy.
Fat chance!
It's the luck of the draw.
- Germain, do you take...
- Know what they're doing?
They've giving land to young soldiers who've completed 5 of their 7 years of service.
- So?
- So they won't leave.
They'll have to spend at least 2 more years here.
Here is your title of ownership, a plow and a horse to go with it, and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards.
Madam, here is the key to your house.
Live happily and prosper.
Here is your title of ownership, a plow and a horse to go with it, and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards.
- Thank you, General.
- Madam, here is the key - to your house. - Thank you.
Live happily and prosper.
Friends! After having conquered this land in the name of France, you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children.
I wish you all the best.
Drum roll.
We're stealing the Arabs' land, General.
No need to exaggerate.
They weren't using it.
But small-scale farming won't turn Algeria into Beauce.
If Abd el-Kader lets us.
The governor chose to send 3 units after him.
I'm to command one.
With all due respect, I'm not sure I'd like to join the hunt.
You don't have a choice, Toussaint.
I've just received word you'll be serving under the young duke of Aumale who'll command Yusuf's unit.
You'll be his interpreter and Hubert, his medical officer.
The king's son!
That's rather flattering.
I regret losing you, but it'll be good for your careers.
Colonel Yusuf spotted the smalah.
It eluded us twice in 4 days, but we have it now.
It's here! By the Taguine well. The troops, the women and children.
How on earth can they move camp that quickly?
I don't know, My Lord.
It's incredible.
Is Abd el-Kader with them?
I didn't want to sound the alarm by getting too close.
- When Abd el-Kader isn't there, he leaves 500 men.
We have enough cavalrymen.
Let's go.
We should wait for the infantry. They're 3 hours away.
Sound the charge, Lieutenant.
My Lord, the duke of Aumale told me to inform you that he captured Abd el-Kader's smalah at noon on May 16.
We left with the cavalry at dawn and encountered them at noon.
I'll never forget this extraordinaire event.
Get to the point, my friend.
The African chasseurs went around the smalah to take it from the rear while Colonel Yusuf launched a frontal attack.
Chaos and panic ensued. There was a stampede.
Good.
Very well indeed.
What about Abd el-Kader?
He wasn't there, General.
General! We captured 300 notables and warlords, their families, horses and sheep, and Abd el-Kader's war chest:
a wonderful booty.
It almost cost the duke of Aumale his life.
Coming, Hubert?
- So?
- All hope is lost, My Lord.
Guard!
Move away!
Let the women and child go and I'll surrender!
Take them away.
You saved my life, Captain.
Is there anything you want?
Give me the 3 prisoners.
They're yours.
She wants to see you.
She's waiting for you outside.
- Why did you abandon me, Odilon?
- Abandon you?
You spied on me and betrayed me.
You believed him?
I knew it.
Hadj Hamou kidnapped me and put me in his harem.
And the letters?
He only managed to get one from me.
I'm here, Odilon, to tell you
I never betrayed you.
But you doubted me.
No.
You didn't love me enough.
Is that your son?
Ours.
Aïssa.
No one must ever know, otherwise Hadj Hamou will kill my son and I.
I'm his wife.
He put me in his harem.
He never asked me anything.
Hadj Hamou is a good man,
He's a good husband and father.
Aïssa and I are his.
I simply wanted you to know.
Hélie told me you're married.
I am.
I had misjudged her.
- She's a good person.
Your worlds are too different.
- You're one to talk.
- It's not the same for me.
You think a man can love several women at once?
Muslims can have up to 4 women.
But there's always a favorite.
Some must sometimes love 2 women equally.
I'm done.
Come in.
You wanted to kill me and almost did.
- It wasn't God's will.
- I know I owe you my life. So you're free to go.
- I'll take up arms again.
- That's your right.
- I'm indebted to you.
- No, we're even now.
Set Naouel and the child free.
We're now bound for life, you and I.
It is our destiny.
I thought the battle of the smalah would end the war, but Abd el-Kader would be on the run for another 4 years.
For 4 years, Hélie and I witnessed Yusuf and Lamoricière's hellish razzias which were answered by piles of severed French heads.
The emir fled to Morocco, where he was followed by Bugeaud who won the Battle of Isly.
The following year, Abd el-Kader butchered a French battalion at Sidi-Brahim.
On Christmas Eve 1847, after having resisted one of the most powerful countries on Earth for 15 years, the emir admitted defeat.
It was God's will.
Budge call!
Accept this horse as submission.
It's the last one I'll ride.
I will now go on foot.
I accept your homage to France, which grants you its protection, as a sign that the past has been forgiven.
You cured my holy mother.
May God watch over you and yours.
Had I had men like yours, I'd now be in Algiers.
Since you defeated me, you're the only person I can entrust with the weapons I used in the last 15 years of fighting you.
I will not be needing them anymore.
I will devote the rest of my life to God.
God is great.
Past enemies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart.
You may see me as alive, but I am dead.
Squadron leader Hubert, on behalf of His Majesty Louis-Philippe, I appoint you Knight of the Legion of Honor.
Congratulations, Hubert, and thank you again.
Squadron leader Toussaint, on behalf of His Majesty, I appoint you Knight of the Legion of Honor.
Congratulations.
End of the proclamation!
- Congratulations, dear friends.
- Thank you.
You deserve it.
A lot remains to be done in this great country.
We'll build it instead of destroy it.
You know there's fighting in Paris right now.
There's talk of a second republic.
So we'll finally see that republic.
- What will happen to Algeria?
- A republic means liberty, equality and fraternity for every man.
Translation:
Magenta Baribeau Épilogue
Welcome to Algeria, where much remains to be done.
The Saint-Simonians' mission is clear:
We want to protect the Arabs' language and religion.
I came to help the emir's family with French knowledge.
May Allah protect them.
I chose the honorable path: war.
I came to see for myself that you're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission.
I found a way to contact Adbelkader.
Violence is the only thing Arabs respect.
These savages must die!
This is a genocide, not a war.
Some Parisian newspapers even wrote that we're the barbarians.
A toast to his lovely wife.
Our best wishes to the newlyweds.
You think a man can love several women simultaneously?
There's always a favorite.
I never betrayed you.
No one must ever know, otherwise Hadj Hamou will kill my son and I.
- He's your son?
- Ours.
You're the only person I can entrust with the weapons I used to fight you these last 15 years.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 2.
DEATH'S FIANCÉE
Mother...
Jérémy?
Émile and Jeanne must do the homework that I spent last night preparing.
Thank you.
Had we stayed in Oran, instead of moving to this godforsaken place, our children could go to school and get a normal education.
As soon as we have the money, we'll send them to the Algiers boarding school.
Did you know that the boy with typhoid died?
I know.
I did all I could.
I hope they won't catch it.
They played with him.
Is there any milk, Djamila?
Not that one.
I don't like goat milk.
It's sour.
There aren't any cows here, sweetie.
We wouldn't be here if your father hadn't left the army.
Where is he going, Mother?
I hadn't left the army, I had been kicked out for being republican and pro-Arab.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
I was a republican.
The '48 revolution hit Paris, then Oran.
I believed in the new republic. And I still do. And I'm most certainly pro-Arab.
The Europeans mixed up revolution and beatings.
I paid the price after Napoleon III's December '51 coup.
Don't stay there. You have plenty of room.
Spread it out!
Leila wanted us to leave for France.
But leaving Algeria was out of the question.
So I rented this farm from a settler from Ariège who became disheartened and left with a bad fever.
"These dates are excellent."
Period.
"The umbrella is... "a nice shade "of red."
- What's wrong, Jeanne?
- My stomach hurts.
You don't have a fever.
Yaouled wrote "umprella."
- With a p!
- Stop teasing Yaouled.
I'd like to see you write Arabic!
He can't write Arabic either!
Don't listen to him. You've made tremendous progress.
- He made 15 mistakes yesterday.
- You made 12!
Why isn't Ishem here?
She's a girl.
Her father won't allow it.
- Why not?
- She might get ideas.
Alright. Let's continue.
The camel has big teeth.
Yaouled, make sure your sheep don't eat my wife's flowers.
Why are you calling me Yaouled?
I'm Ahmed.
You're Oran's Yaouled to me.
Go get the others, Ahmed, I've got a surprise.
Try them on. You'll be able to work faster.
Against thorns and rocks.
Your week's pay.
Kader. Cherif.
A gift.
Clean the stables and the horses' bedding like I showed you.
Boss! Mr. Charmasson is coming.
The Delorme farm was attacked this morning.
You're a doc, - there might be some wounded.
- Go get my kit.
Antoine?
Marie?
Savages! Madmen!
Come.
There's nothing we can do here.
Go get help at the village. We'll give them a nice burial.
Madmen!
What's the army waiting for?
You know they hate settlers.
They're savages!
The only solution is to eradicate them, like the Americans did with the Indians.
This is their land.
They were wasting it.
Don't make excuses for them!
I'm not!
I'm only trying to understand.
There's nothing to understand, Hubert!
Their own brothers...
Why? Why!
"Hadjouts" kill infidels and traitors
- so they can go to Heaven. - Bullshit!
That's what the marabout said.
It's holy war, "jihad."
The man who kills goes to Heaven.
Why are they wearing their shoes around their necks?
Their feet hurt.
They prefer going barefoot.
- But they cost me a fortune!
- Good.
They won't get used.
The workers want to invite you and your wife to thank you.
There's way too much.
We can't eat all this.
Politeness dictates you have to eat a lot.
Then you burp and say that you're full.
He'll be pleased.
This is stupid.
They probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning.
- They're generous and behaving like lords.
It's delicious.
He has trachoma.
We have to do something.
He can come to the farm whenever he wants.
It's because of Marie. - It's a race.
- They should close the valve.
That's right, blame Allah.
- You're not married?
- I'm not rich enough.
Wash his eyes everyday or he'll become blind.
Always wash children's hands and faces.
- We don't have much water.
- Come get some at the farm.
Not too tired?
Are you due soon?
Mother...
Jeanne is crying.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Typhoid fever!
I knew it.
She'll die!
- Calm down.
We'll treat her.
- Stop it! I'm a nurse!
Everyone around is dying of cholera, typhoid and dysentery!
You're exaggerating.
428 people died at the "funduq" last year.
And 94 in Boufarik.
The Mitidja is a rotten swamp!
The Arabs were right calling it "death's fiancée."
If the mosquitoes don't get us, Hadjouts will slit our throats
- and we'll all die! - Enough!
You're exhausted.
Go to bed.
I'll take care of Jeanne.
Yes, I'm exhausted.
I can't stand it.
I want to leave.
I'll leave with the kids if you want to stay.
How will you get by?
We don't have any money.
I'll find work as a nurse or as a maid.
The children will go to school.
I want to leave.
Then leave!
I can't stand your constant whining!
Come with us. I beg you!
No.
I belong here.
- Hurry, Mother!
I'll go see the chief physician at the Mustafa Hospital.
He agreed to hire me.
- He's a good man.
- I hope you'll enjoy yourself.
Algiers is full of thieves and adventurers.
Will you come visit?
I'll visit the children. Time permitting.
Take them to Blida.
The army has set up convoys to Algiers.
Goodbye, sweetie.
Goodbye, Émile.
- Bye, Djamila.
- We never should have come here.
I know.
Take care of yourself.
Gee up!
I've had enough of Paris.
It's so gray and expensive here.
I don't have any friends.
Why don't we go home to Algiers?
I hear Leila and her children are there.
- What about Odilon?
- He stayed on the farm.
I don't get him.
We always said:
The land is for the Arabs, commerce, industry and mines for the French.
You're not listening to me.
I don't feel at home here.
The children are teased at school because they're Muslim and the salesgirls don't respect me.
I'm fighting for you, the children and the Algerians, so people will respect your religion, values and the color of your skin.
Algeria's fate is being decided here in Paris.
We've been here for years and no one listened to you.
The republic no longer exists. The republic no longer exists.
This is an empire, but nothing has changed.
You're wrong.
Remember Fleury?
- The young lieutenant?
- He's a general now,
His Majesty's closest advisor.
I sent him my pamphlets and my book.
He read them to the emperor.
It'll happen, you'll see.
Then we'll go home? I promise.
We'll go home to Algeria.
I love you, Bahia.
So it doesn't matter where we are.
You're right.
My dear Toussaint, we have good news for you.
They're about to start building the Algiers-Blida railroad.
Our friend Fournel is surveying Algeria's mineral resources. - He sent his report.
- Quite promising.
- We plan to invest.
- Large sums.
Thank you, sirs.
With your help, Algeria will become
- a modern country.
- Apologies for my tardiness.
We're making headway. The emperor freed Adbelkader and authorized him to leave France for Turkey.
As the Duke of Aumale and General Lamoricière had promised him when he surrendered over 5 years ago.
Despite this promise, France kept him prisoner - all these years. - I know, I know.
That was during King Louis-Philippe's reign.
The emperor made amends.
He brought Adbelkader to Longchamp races, the opera, awarded him the Legion of Honor.
We're now best friends.
Won't his liberation fuel Algeria's holy war?
He promised never to take up arms against France.
The only way to ensure peace in Algeria is to make it an independent colony where all Algerians would be equal citizens.
The emperor is in favor of that.
He spent most of his exile in England and admires
- British institutions.
- So what's he waiting for? It's time to give that territory its own statute.
He has other worries:
Russia, Italy...
Didn't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that Algeria was and would remain a French province?
Isn't this matter already closed?
I hope not.
Wanting Arabs to abide by French rules would be a mistake.
They have different customs and values and another religion.
Grab a plate. Eat with me.
No, it's pork.
- I can't eat it.
- There must be some chicken too.
Thank you.
Straight! You want a straight line!
Get out of here!
I said leave!
There you are.
Can you tell that idiot to leave my land?
These darn nomads don't respect private property.
Of course.
They don't know what that is.
What he say?
That it's communal land that belongs to everyone.
Are you kidding?
He knows I bought it from the government.
Scram!
Look at that strange set-up.
It's a great concept.
The camel is strong, but doesn't walk straight.
The donkey does.
- It's quite ingenious.
- I see you're still pro-Arab. They're bad neighbors.
So you sent your wife and kids to Algiers?
- She wanted to leave.
- Can't blame her.
This is a hard place for women and children.
Come see me tomorrow.
I'll be planting a liberty tree.
We can have a drink.
It'll take your mind off things.
Friends, this liberty tree is just like those we planted in France during the '48 revolution, a symbol of our faith in the republic.
Napoleon III desecrated the second republic and deported 12,000 of us to these wild African lands.
Why?
Because Guérin stood on the highest barricade at the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
Because Roucariès refused to use his journalistic talents to serve the usurper.
Bravo!
And you, Ludovic, because the townspeople had elected you republican mayor!
They wanted to break us, but we and our Spanish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this Algerian land are capable of!
Let's turn this rotten Mitidja into a garden that we can one day transform into a new republic.
I propose the creation of a settlers association and a newspaper, "The Settler's Voice,"
that Roucariès will manage.
Long live the republic!
Music!
Don't forget republican principles mean liberty, equality and fraternity for everyone, including Arabs.
You must be kidding, Hubert.
These savages cut our compatriots' throats!
You want to turn them into Frenchmen?
You abolished slavery in '48.
Be coherent.
Arabs are men like you and I. We're all brothers.
What a sermon!
Leave that to the Arab representatives.
Beni Sassen's kaid is throwing a party next week.
Captain Audran invited us.
Come with, you'll see.
You're going?
It's Id al-Adha, an important Muslim holiday. We sacrifice sheep to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice.
Wasn't Abraham Jewish?
Judaism, Christianity and Islam are sister religions,
Talking about sheep...
You know it's the nomads' main source of income.
They say they don't have enough grazing fields.
Audran, I see what you're getting at.
Their sheep grazing on our land is a real problem.
They trample our seedlings and eat our wheat.
One flock of sheep grazed on your land.
We paid the fine.
They're nomads. They can go elsewhere.
Each tribe follows its own route.
Setting foot on another tribe's land could start a war.
That's their problem.
You're not making my job any easier.
We're trying to build trust with tribes loyal to our country but the encampment policy, which was adopted against the army's advice and gave you land that belonged to the Arabs, is turning the tribes against us and undermining our work.
What work?
We're the workers here, not you or them.
You wouldn't be here without the army!
That's an entrance!
Yes, they know how to fight!
You said it.
You don't want these horsemen to become our enemies again.
Don't worry, Captain.
We know how to defend ourselves.
Sure.
Like the Delormes family.
Be careful, boss.
Why?
The marabout said, "The time has come.
"Take the Frenchman's land, sheep and wife.
Everything!"
Then everyone chanted, "God is great."
They've been saying this for 20 years, but we're still here.
Boss!
The workers!
- What about them?
- They left.
- What do you mean?
- The workers, sheep,
- horses and mules, all gone!
- Do you know where they went?
No.
- They're all gone?
Damn it!
They even took their shoes!
I thought they hurt their feet!
- They can sell them at the souk.
- And the cattle?
- You think they stole all this?
The Hadjout.
Mr. Saïd listened and cheered on the marabout.
- Take this and guard the farm.
- Where are you going, boss?
To get a horse - and find them. - Be careful, boss.
Hadjouts are very mean.
- Let me call the army.
- Certainly not! - There'd be a massacre.
- Hadjouts will butcher you.
They know who I am.
Thanks for the horse!
What if Leila was right?
I'm a doctor, not a farmer.
Maybe I should give up and leave.
Then I realized it's too late.
We have to stay, change these people, give them laws, civilize them.
I was crazy about Algeria.
It's such a beautiful country.
I come as a friend.
- I'm not armed!
- Where are my workers?
- They work for us now.
You work your own brothers like slaves?
Punishment for their betrayal.
The Hadjouts I met were Abdelkader's best warriors. Now they're just cutthroat murderous cowards!
They violated a saint's grave! That's sacrilege!
They were punished.
It's God's law.
- Pay!
- I have no money.
Heard that? They want your wife.
We'll visit your wife. She'll pay for you.
Kill me now.
We'll show her this and she'll come get you.
She'll bring the army.
You'll all be shot!
Aïcha...
I read your articles and pamphlet on Algeria.
Let me say that I completely disagree with your arabophile views.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I suppose you're an arabophobe?
Call it what you will.
As departmental head of the Algerian government my views are not theoretical, but based on real things.
I thought we were discussing people - and not things.
- What are your views?
The cross and the crescent are irreconcilable.
Christians and Muslims cannot live together unless one dominates the other.
- Why should Christians dominate?
- It's the law of the jungle.
You're shocked?
This is how it's been throughout history.
We're the masters of Algeria.
Why can't the cross and the crescent get along?
The Arabs have refused to cooperate these last 20 years.
They wage wars on us, cut our settlers' throats, burn our farms, dream of throwing us in the sea.
It's because we see them as the defeated and not as partners.
What if Cossacks or Prussians still occupied Paris? If they had burned your family home in Normandy, seized your land and destroyed your churches?
Forgive me, General, but I refuse to continue to debate with someone who compares our troops to Cossacks!
This is insufferable!
Come, darling.
Can you believe that fool?
To think they're considering him for the secretary general position in Algiers.
He treated me like a "moukère." I put him in his place.
You should have seen the look on his face!
You did well, Bahia.
General Fleury offered me an assignment in Algiers.
My articles and my book are quite popular over there.
- Say you'll take me with you.
- Of course I will.
And we'll visit Odilon.
I haven't heard from him in over a year.
Leila wrote me that she's worried about him.
You smell nice.
Do as I say.
- You were with those thieves?
- When Abdelkader surrendered, I took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart.
How is your son?
- I'm trying to make him a man.
- May Allah watch over him.
Abdelkader and I only wished to go to the Mecca, but the French didn't keep their word and kept him prisoner.
So I joined the Hadjout. You saw it:
Lions became vultures. - Murderers.
- It's not their fault.
The French are stronger.
You fought valiantly.
The time for peace has come.
I'll speak to Governor Randon on your behalf.
God willing.
He's the only one I trust.
It's up to him.
Enough about God!
He helps those who help themselves!
My mind's made up. I'm going to Algiers.
You're deserting, Hubert.
Farming is hard work,
- but we can't give up. - My wife was right.
We're not made to live this way.
You'll find someone else to lease the farm.
That's not the problem.
Spaniards can work it.
Think it over.
Need some help?
Boss, I want to go to Algiers with you.
I can guard your house, take the children to school, - anything!
- Of course.
- Your wife will be thrilled.
- You think so?
She cried a lot when I took her to Blida.
You're part of the family.
You're like a mother and father to me.
I fell in love with the white city of Algiers that embraces the Mediterranean shore.
Leila had waited for me and forgiven me.
She worked as a nurse, was radiantly happy, had found her place in society.
I finally set up my own practice.
Algiers's European community was expanding by the day.
I had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a French province.
Not for military men, but for settlers turning this place into a new country.
Odilon!
How are you?
Let me introduce our copy editor, Benjamin Bensoussan, and Jeanne, the "Illustration" correspondent.
Hello.
Excuse me. What do you think of this?
I went all out.
It's 4 pages long.
There's your biography, what happened to you, everything!
You'll become a hero to the colony!
Here's your tale.
You're very talented!
I said that before, haven't I?
We should team up.
I could sell you half my shares.
- I don't have any money.
- Same here!
Buy them on credit.
- Let's shake on it.
- Sold. I'm for the settlers, now I know how they operate.
You finally got it.
It's all here in my editorial.
"Paris's indifference. "The army's incompetence and arrogance.
"Native laziness."
Read the conclusion! I showed Randon what's what!
"Down with the sword. It's time for civil power.
"Algeria is French!"
- Want to show me around?
- With pleasure.
Children, did you know your father is a hero?
It's in all the newspapers.
- Don't exaggerate.
- I heard about it in school.
Why are you a hero, Father?
Did you kill a lot of Arabs?
- No. Why would you think that?
- When we play cops and robbers, the robbers are always Arabs.
Ridiculous!
I'll have a word with your teacher!
They won't let me be a cop.
- Why not?
- They say I'm mixed.
What's that?
Someone who's half-half.
Half French and half Arab.
- Am I half Arab?
- I don't wanna be!
You're not.
You're a quarter Kabyle.
- Pass me the jam.
- Isn't that the same?
Not at all!
Kabyles are not Arabs.
So I can be a cop.
Yes.
Of course you can play cop, but you can't kill anyone.
- Got it?
- Hurry up, you'll be late.
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.
Make sure you pay attention.
- Bye, sweetie.
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.
- Have a nice day.
Everyone is talking about you.
I like it here.
I feel like I'm in France.
- But with Arabs.
- We live separately here.
I have to go.
General Randon asked me to come see him.
See you tonight.
So, Hubert, you want to bite the hand that fed you?
You're a retired officer, aren't you?
- I am, General.
- And you write for this rag, run by Roucariès.
A Commie!
We should have sent him to New Caledonia.
- He's a Republican, General.
- A Commie! An anarchist!
He defends mercenaries, adventurers and deportees who come to Algeria to exploit native labor!
Let me remind you, General, that the settlers are colonizing and farming this land - on behalf of France.
- Land that the army conquered!
We'll discuss this some other time.
I asked you here because you're familiar with the Mitidja.
I'm worried. New incidents have been reported.
Marabout Sidi Yacoub travels the area and gets them all worked up.
It's an epidemic!
Reports of so-called marabouts all over the country, calling for "jihad."
- They have monkeys and goats. - It's an old tradition.
They capture the imagination of the naïve and ignorant who fall for their cheap tricks.
- They're illusionists.
- Exactly.
- Ever heard of Robert Houdin?
Your marabouts couldn't hold a candle to him.
- I asked Paris to send him here.
- I fail to see the connection.
Arabs are a superstitious people.
They're amazed by sleight of hand.
I'll show them a better magician than all their marabouts.
Robert Houdin!
General Bugeaud once tried to send them false prophets.
They were all murdered.
This is different!
This one's French!
I'd bet you anything that he'll amaze them!
He amazed me, so...
The Arabs want to see wonders, so I'll show them wonders!
One last thing, I'm told you're friends with an author called Toussaint, a man turning Paris upside down, demanding that Arabs
- be considered our equals?
- I am. He's here, on a mission for General Fleury.
I had to give him an office.
I'm not sure what he's up to, but I don't like it, so I'm having him followed.
Try to get some information out of him and keep me apprized.
Want some wine, boss?
Ahmed, I told you to call him "sir."
Sorry.
Want some wine, sire?
- Sir.
- No, I'm fine, Yaouled.
And stop calling him Yaouled.
His name's Ahmed.
Didn't I tell you?
I decided we should Frenchify our lifestyle.
I ordered Restoration armchairs.
I like the sitting room the way it is.
That stuck-up woman at the General's asked if I was a Moor!
That's why. That's not an insult.
You're half Spanish, a quarter Kabyle and a quarter French.
And the end result is not bad at all.
I'm French!
I don't want people thinking I'm a "moukère!"
Did you know the Toussaints were here?
The moved into one of the best palaces in Algiers.
I know. He's important now.
He's General Fleury's agent and speaks for Parisian arabophiles.
I saw Bahia this afternoon.
She's putting on airs now that she's lived in Paris.
- Sauce?
- Please.
She invited us to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm looking forward to seeing Hélie.
- Isn't this a bit cold?
- No.
Sorry, but it is.
Yaouled?
Ahmed.
Ahmed!
Could we have forks?
I don't eat with my hands anymore.
So?
I don't understand why you stopped writing me.
You let me down.
You'd promised to ask your friends to help me.
- I'm still waiting.
- Sorry, it wasn't easy with all these changes of regime: first a kingdom, then a republic, and now an empire.
- You don't know how it is.
- I do.
Judging by your stripes, you didn't do too badly during these hard times...
What happened to you?
You've changed.
While you were having fun in Paris, - I went through hell here!
- Why did you become a settler?
That's enough.
I've heard enough.
Go see how they live on the Mitidja!
I now understand what "bad settlers" are.
Excuse me.
- How are your children?
- Well.
And yours?
Well.
I'd like them to live here.
Why?
They're lucky enough to study in France.
Excuse me.
I'd like them to know their homeland and to speak Arabic.
What for?
What's important is that they speak French.
It's their culture, their roots.
I don't want them to deny their origins, like others do.
Is this why you still wear a "jellaba"?
I'm proud to wear it.
And it will never go out of style.
It's their damn religion that puts them to sleep.
Medieval fatalism.
What are you doing to help them?
Touring Robert Houdin disguised as a marabout?
You want them to stay ignorant so you can dominate them.
We have to defend ourselves.
Your desertion policy would have us all leave within 5 years.
Did you forget our dream of uniting the East and the West?
Only equality and progress can give Arabs their dignity back.
They don't want your progress.
Ask our Saint-Simonian brothers. Ask Talabot.
They're sabotaging his railroad.
To modernize the country, we need to impose our laws and our better institutions. It's not only in our interest,
- but in theirs.
- Am I really hearing this?
You sound like those colonialists I keep meeting here in Algiers!
I found more support for Algerians in Paris!
It's easy to be pro-Arab when you live in Paris.
No one is on your side here, not governor, army or settlers.
You've already lost the battle.
I'll be frank.
Your newspaper is jeopardizing our collaboration with Arabs.
This might result in a war.
There's nothing left to be said.
Let's go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
How sad.
They're hopeless.
Misfortune has made them bitter.
I, Hadj Hamou, give you my horse as well as this sword with which I've always fought fairly.
My life is in your hands.
You can have my son as a symbol of my sincerity.
May God help you decide our fate.
As a show of faith, I'll let you keep your sword and horse, but I'll take care of your son.
He can serve France when he's older.
Go back to your people and live peacefully.
Drum roll!
I'll only use it to defend my new friends if they're attacked.
I'll see to it that he goes to a good school, so he can follow in his father's footsteps.
France's flag is wide and can shelter all those who seek refuge and protection.
I spent 20 years of my life fighting, killing and destroying.
I will now devote myself to peace and rebuilding.
I could take care of him and his studies.
Under one condition.
Which is?
That you let him be Muslim.
I swear to your God and mine to do so.
I'll care for him as if he were my own.
How long will that boy stay in our home?
I don't know.
It'll depend on his studies.
He eats with his hands. He doesn't know how to use a fork.
He'll learn.
This is what we're here for.
You treat that child better than your own.
- Good night, Father.
Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Sidi Baba.
- Good night.
You're not his father.
He's only repeating what he's heard.
You've got a new nightgown.
Where did you get it?
I got some proper clothes.
Why do you always hide that you're kind-hearted?
- I want to see Father. - Go on.
- Stop touching my things!
Don't mind him. He's just mean.
You can play with me.
A pearl.
- A chair.
- A table.
- A girl.
- A pearl.
Not a pearl.
A girl.
"A girl."
A boy.
"A boy." A girl. A boy.
Go to bed.
But say your prayers first.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women...
I was a medical officer, he, an interpreter.
It was a mythical Algeria.
Wanting Arabs to abide by French rules would be a mistake.
They're our partners,...
The doc is a spy.
Watch his every move.
- Bring me all his letters.
- I'm in love.
She's here to spy on you.
That's what the Arabs do!
This is a war of conquest and extermination of Arabs.
Some Parisian newspapers even wrote that we're the barbarians.
Algeria is and must remain a French province.
I hadn't left the army, I had been kicked out for being republican and pro-Arab.
After having conquered this land in the name of France, you will now farm it. And make it your new home!
Can't the cross and the crescent get along?
They have different customs and values.
They're savages!
You'll all be shot!
You didn't do too badly during these hard times...
You want to bite the hand that fed you?
You write for this rag?
You sound like those colonialists I keep meeting here in Algiers!
It's easy to be pro-Arab when you live in Paris.
I never betrayed you.
No one must ever know.
- He's your son?
- Ours.
I couldn't show my happiness.
I hope we won't regret raising this child as ours.
Why would we?
My son Aïssa looked so much like Naouel, whom I had loved so much.
What was in store for him?
L'Algérie des chimères A DREAM OF ALGERIA 3.
THE ARAB KINGDOM
You're so handsome and strong, my son.
You're the one who's beautiful, Mom.
- You are.
- No.
I'm old now.
Your father doesn't look at me anymore.
- He took a new wife. Very young.
- Another one?
Since you joined the French, he took 2 wives to sire children.
I'm not a good mare.
I only had one son.
You.
I think polygamy is barbaric.
You sound like a Frenchman.
It's the "Kaida." The Prophet had 9 wives.
- What's the new wife's name?
- She's from a noble clan.
She is jealous of me.
Wanted me sent to the kitchen.
No way!
You're coming to Algiers, to stay with me.
No!
Be reassured, son.
Your father respects and protects me.
Besides, I don't want to be a burden on you.
It's time for you to get married.
I chose a nice girl for you from a good family. Very pretty and sweet.
Sixteen. Nice hips, not like me.
She'll give you beautiful kids.
- No.
- You don't want to get married?
Your brothers are already engaged, but your father won't let them marry because you're the eldest.
I want to choose my own wife.
You love someone else.
Yes.
A French woman?
Yes.
- Who is she?
- I can't tell you.
Not even to your mother?
I don't know if her parents will allow it.
- It's because you're an Arab.
- No.
It's more complicated.
No, it isn't.
Be careful Aïssa.
The French are hypocrites.
They're against polygamy, but they all have mistresses.
They won't give you their daughter.
Love can break all barriers.
You're young.
Time erases all... even love.
Your old mother... knows.
Abdallah seems to be managing well.
I'm not used to it anymore.
You can study here.
I slowly built up a nice library.
I even found manuscripts that belonged to Emir Abdelkader.
May God protect him in exile.
France stole you from us, Aïssa.
You forgot that you gave me to France.
It made me into an officer.
It's like a mother to me.
There are 2 France, Aïssa.
That's what I learned.
In Paris, France made you an officer and freed Italy. Here, France keeps Algeria under its yoke.
The governor is seizing our land to give to the colonists.
What do they want?
Herd us in the Sahara?
I'm certain Napoleon III is against confinement.
Five tribal elders and I are to meet him in Compiègne.
We'll see if he's on our side.
- We must trust him.
- May God hear you... and inspire him truth and justice.
Aïssa was back.
What joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence, now a grown man covered in glory under the French banner.
- At Magenta and Solferino?
- Yes.
- You lucky devil. - Émile.
War is no joke, except for kings and emperors. Victory in Solferino cost thousands of lives.
Yes, but we saved the Italians from Austrian occupation.
What a beautiful uniform.
You look handsome.
- Dinner is ready.
- Let's go.
Tell us all about it.
To Aïssa.
I looked at Aïssa.
He was proof that one could be a good Frenchman and a good a Muslim.
Did he embody the successful union of the East and the West?
I started to believe in it again.
I don't like the way Aïssa looks at Jeanne.
- Going out?
With those goo goo eyes of his.
- Didn't you notice?
- No. Why?
- Suppose he's in love with her.
- What are you talking about?
I hope we won't regret raising this child as ours.
On the contrary.
He's the perfect example of integration.
- He's like a Frenchman.
- Perhaps. But he isn't.
He is by the blood he spilled, fighting for France.
That's fine, but I don't want him to touch my daughter.
Don't worry.
He's staying in town and wants to be his own man.
I hope so.
I have something to tell you, Jeanne.
I love war.
I discovered a new homeland:
In the army, barriers fall.
I'm not a Muslim among Catholics or an Arab among French.
I'm a soldier among soldiers. All equal before death.
Only one rule: courage.
- Do you understand?
- I don't know. It's a male world where women have no place.
I'm bored, Aïssa.
I need to do something useful, exciting, unique.
Sometimes I envy the fate of colonist women.
It's dangerous but so exciting.
Jeanne. Will you marry me?
Of course.
When we were little, we said we'd get married.
Will your parents let their daughter marry a Muslim?
I don't know about Dad.
Mother won't.
But I don't care.
- Where is Miss Jeanne?
- Outside.
How are you feeling?
Well.
Why?
You've been odd, lately.
You can trust me.
Among women, we can understand each other.
Nothing is troubling me.
A mother feels such things.
You're a big girl, Jeanne.
It's time to think about your future.
There're many young officers from good families in Algiers.
I'll invite some for you to meet.
- I'm not in a hurry to marry.
- Then you'll be an old maid.
Mother!
What are you driving at?
I don't want you to fall for just anyone.
That's all.
- That's what it is. - Yes.
That's what it is.
You've changed since Aïssa's return.
- You have a soft spot for him.
- Not a soft spot.
We're in love.
We want to get married.
What?
Marry an Arab?
A Muslim?
No way!
Marriage is something serious.
You marry someone with the same religion and background.
I forbid you to see this boy.
Understood?
I forbid you.
Understood?
Yes.
- I knew it.
I told you. - Thank you.
And you thought they were like brother and sister.
I'll call the police if he sets foot in here again.
What's gotten into you?
We raised him as one or ours.
Unfortunately, yes.
Anyway you always had a soft spot for him.
- I don't want him to touch her.
He won't have the chance anyway.
His regiment is leaving for France, then Mexico.
- When?
- I don't know.
The Emperor wants Maximilian of Austria in Mexico.
Very good.
How can you say that.
It's war over there.
Just as well.
Maybe he'll get killed.
Is Jeanne there?
Get out!
Beat it!
Never set foot in this house!
Go away!
- You had no right to stop him.
- You do what you're told.
You can't stop me.
I'll leave, come what may.
I'll join him, become a Muslim if need be.
- Go to your room!
- Don't touch me!
Don't you ever, again.
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped from home.
- Are you out of your mind?
- I came to say goodbye.
- What are you doing?
- I want to be yours.
I can't believe it!
Look at this!
See the news?
Your circumcised pal is taking 5 elders to see the Emperor.
- Did you know?
- No.
- We're not close anymore.
- They are plotting in Compiègne, with General Fleury and the Saint-Simonians.
- What do they want?
- Arabize us.
Saïd, come with me.
Take care of yourself!
Don't worry.
This trip is very important for me.
The Emperor has decided.
He read my books.
He plans a new Algeria policy, my policy.
Can you understand that?
- You'll see the kids at least. - Of course.
I'll write every day and tell you what's happening.
"Dear Bahia, you can't imagine how lavishly
"the Emperor received our Arab friends at Compiègne."
"Everything is so wonderful.
"The Emperor held long talks with the elders.
"He promised complete equality between Europeans and Arabs.
"'That's but fair, honorable and right, ' he told them. "Who were delighted, you can imagine.
"It's truly a revolution."
"The native chiefs gave the Emperor a black stallion, "a magnificent offspring of the famous Godolphin Arabian, "father of all thoroughbreds.
"His Majesty has a special place for it.
"'We'll be able to compete with the British, ' Gen. Fleury said.
"Her Majesty the Empress and the Imperial Prince "showed our friends consideration and appreciation.
"The Emperor recognized Aïssa, whom he decorated at Magenta. "He also introduced him to the Empress.
"His father, Hadj Hamou, was filled with pride.
"Finally, His Majesty did me the honor
"to explain in detail his project to our friends "to turn Algeria into an Arab Kingdom."
Dear friends, here's the man whose works have inspired the Emperor's policy.
No one can better explain it to you.
I'll give him the floor.
The Emperor asked me to tell you that we didn't come to Algeria to oppress or plunder, but to bring you the blessings of civilization.
He wants to make Algeria an Arab Kingdom.
Henceforth, he'll protect you, as he does the French.
He is both Emperor of the French and King of the Arabs.
- In practice, what does it mean?
- Firstly... the Emperor will end the confinement policy.
Your title to traditional tribal lands will be recognized.
No more despoliation.
- Will land be ours?
- It will belong to the tribes.
Later, everyone will have a share.
Secondly... Following the proclamation of full European-Arab equality, the Emperor shall grant French citizenship to Jews and Arabs who so desire.
We know France brings progress and we are grateful.
But we'd rather live according to our own laws and customs.
For us Muslims, religion rules everything.
You know that.
The Koran is our civil code, our book of science and medicine, the Word of God.
I assure you, all your views will be taken into account.
Let us begin.
What's your impression?
They are delighted by their stay.
They were also charmed by His Majesty.
I think they'll agree with the Arab Kingdom model, except for Si Kadour, my father-in-law.
We have to handle him carefully.
He's very influential in Kabylia.
In any event, it's imperative for His Majesty to come to Algeria to launch his policy.
It will provoke colonist and military opposition.
He'll come.
It's only a question of timing.
If Pélissier doesn't like it, we'll replace him.
There you are.
Talabot has been waiting for you for half an hour.
- Paulin, I'm happy to see you.
- Odilon.
- What are you doing in Algiers?
- Big news, old pal.
Next week, we'll be laying down the last railroad track. We're also inaugurating the new Blida station.
Marshal Pélissier...
Everyone will be there.
I hope you'll write a nice article.
Is the paper yours?
I bought 50% from Roucariès, but it's not doing well.
No.
I have to meet Pélissier.
I gave Roucariès all the details.
- See you later at the café.
- Agreed.
Is Mr. Talabot a Saint-Simonian?
I heard you were too.
Does this sect still exist?
They're scattered, but still have influence at the court, among university students and bankers.
Here's the article. Lately, they've become like the Freemasons.
What do they want?
The utopians like Toussaint believe in Santa Claus.
The others believe in progress, thinking that with money, factories, mines and railroads, they can solve everything.
The paradox is that they began as socialists, and now they're big capitalists.
I saw Hélie yesterday.
We spoke about you and old times.
It seems you had a falling out?
We have nothing to say to each other.
He's Gen. Fleury's man. He heads the pro-Arab camp that wants to sell out Algeria.
We disagree about the future of this country.
You're both wrong.
Hélie thinks that the French and Arabs can live as equals.
You want to turn them into Frenchmen.
That's an illusion.
And you?
What's your solution? I... build.
I build railroads and roads, dig the ground, plant trees.
I represent progress, a sort of charity.
I deal with reality, not dreams.
Do you know what Arabs say about your railroad?
"Al-rabat sheitan," the devil's cart.
I'm hungry.
Let's have lunch.
Good piece, Benjamin!
You'll do the next on the army's anti-confinement action.
- Look!
Nice layout.
- Yes.
Boy, come here.
It's time I tell him.
I have bad news.
- I can guess.
- I can't pay you.
You haven't paid him in 2 months.
It's not my fault if we don't have money.
Half the colonists are Spanish and can't read French.
- I got an idea.
- Really?
Struck gold?
- Maybe.
- Serious?
- Where?
- Here in Algiers. - What is it?
- My dad's pockets.
We're always ready to help our French friends.
From the start of conquest we offered France our services.
We know the Turks and Arabs well, Mr. Hubert.
We've dealt with them for 2 centuries, since my ancestors came from Leghorn to trade between Barbary Coast pirates and Italian merchants.
Please, sit down.
We know your father advises Gen. Bugeaud on Arab affairs.
Benjamin told me about your paper's financial difficulties.
That shouldn't be a problem. My eldest son David, who runs our bank, can help you.
Did you hear me?
With a special rate for friends.
Thank you very much. Let me also say how much we appreciate Benjamin's intelligence, skills and talents.
Yes, Benjamin.
I sent him to law school in Montpellier. It cost a bundle, but we wanted him to be our lawyer.
But in France, he caught the political bug.
Politics seals the fate of nations.
It's very important.
Trade is safer.
Business is business, whoever is in power.
Since your paper deals with politics, I've a favor to ask.
Please, tell me.
As head of the Jewish Council, I'm host to a French Member of Parliament who is concerned about our small community. His name is Adolphe Crémieux.
I hope he gets French citizenship for Algerian Jews.
I thought you weren't interested in politics.
It's, let's say, about religion.
We'll be glad to interview him.
Tell him to come to the paper.
Thank you.
Actually, thank you for what you're doing for the paper.
It's for a good cause, that of a French Algeria where Jews will play an important role.
Since that is the case, could you arrange a meeting between myself as head of the Jewish Council, and the governor-general?
The army and I aren't...
You can see to it with my son Daniel.
Perhaps.
- See you tomorrow... 8 AM?
- Yes.
Bahia?
- Had a good trip?
- A bit long.
- I missed you.
- You too. - Come!
- You're still as beautiful.
Tell me about the kids.
They're well.
They send their love and miss you.
Ahmed got his Ph.D. in law with honors.
Good!
Now he can practice in Algiers.
- I'm not sure he wants to.
- You'll get upset.
- Tell me!
He thinks he won't make it in Algiers.
He's decided to stay in Paris and changed his name.
- He now calls himself Amédée.
- My son Ahmed?
Don't be upset!
I don't like it, but I can understand him.
In Paris, an Arab name sticks out like a turban.
Many Jews and Poles took French names.
He won't be the first.
Then, why aren't French taking Arab names here?
It's a religious thing.
The French take saints' names.
- I won't have it.
- Bahia!
I'll write him what I think.
Calm down.
Things will change.
Ahmed might too.
The Emperor accepted our proposals.
Algeria will be an Arab Kingdom with equal citizens.
It will be a tough sell.
Everyone is against you.
- You must be hungry.
- A bit.
Marshal Pélissier will see you.
- Some port as you wait?
- No, thanks.
I don't drink.
A cigar?
I don't smoke.
Besides, it's Ramadan.
Sorry!
I forgot.
The governor is in a foul mood.
He got orders from Paris, he doesn't like.
I think I know what they are.
So you're here.
Did you put all this nonsense in His Majesty's head?
My respects, Marshal.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't be so coy!
This letter of instructions from His Majesty,
which he personally signed.
It talks about the end of the confinement policy, about the Arab Kingdom,
and Arab-European equality.
Did you put him up to it?
It's full of your books' subversive language... and that of your friends, Fleury, David...
You flatter me thinking I have such influence on His Majesty.
No doubletalk.
Hear this, little fellow!
I was on the beach when we landed.
I didn't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the Arabs who'll mess it up.
I won't ever accept that!
Do you hear me?
Ever!
May I remind you, Sir. The country belongs to the Arabs.
No more.
We took it with our blood.
And especially with theirs.
Listen, Toussaint!
We aren't dreamers, visionaries.
We build.
We're turning Algeria into a modern country bringing comfort to the colonists and progress to the natives.
There is no other viable plan.
All else is idle talk for frustrated intellectuals a bit like you.
You won't build anything without the Algerians.
Toussaint...
You might be the smartest, but I warn you... I shall stop you.
God be my witness! I'm the strongest.
I too have connections in the court.
Perhaps you forget that my wife is the Empress' cousin.
- May I go, Marshal?
- Get out!
And don't get in my way or you'll regret it.
My respects, Marshal.
What arrogance!
I asked the Emperor to remove this good-for-nothing.
He's General Fleury's man and he's backed by the Emperor.
By Jove, we'll see who's the strongest.
Keep your smooth talk for Paris.
When we came here, there was nothing but desert, swamps, flies and dwarf palms.
One third of us died of cholera.
One third gave up and rented the land to the Arabs.
We are the last third.
We survived massacres, disease, drought, grasshoppers.
We won't give in to your Arab Kingdom.
Listen! Why end confinement?
Algeria has 3.5 million people. It can feed 20.
We have 12 million hectares of uncultivated land. And you want to stop colonization.
Thousands of colonists can come.
Why leave good land to the Arabs?
Either their herds destroy it, or they badly farm it.
- We produce 6 times they do.
- He's right.
It's our land.
We created a new France here.
Friends, the land belongs to the natives, the colonists and the army.
The Emperor declared it an Arab Kingdom, a European colony and a military camp.
Arrant nonsense.
It's crystal clear to me.
First, we're not your friends, Toussaint. Ruling means choosing.
It's either us or them.
Tell your Emperor that no one will throw us out.
This is our home.
Our enemies want to give power to the Arabs.
If they win, that'll toll the bell for us.
- Do you want to become Arab?
We'll remain French. We won't bow to Napoleon the puny... King of the Arabs!
We are now 200,000 Europeans.
We can't be dismissed.
We've rallied the colonists, and all true republicans:
printers, masons, merchants, and architects.
- Are the Jews with us?
- Of course. They might not dare come out, but I'm here.
We'll mobilize the women and demonstrate with you.
Down with the Emperor!
Long live the Republic!
We had a feverish month.
Algiers was under siege. Every day, people heard our call. Women too.
- French Algeria!
French Algeria! - Present arms!
Get ready!
Let us through.
We're going to the government house.
- The street is closed.
- Let us through!
Aim!
- Forward!
- French Algeria!
Take it easy!
I'm not unhappy about the protests.
They show Paris the futility of its abandonment policy.
Even women are getting into the act.
That's too much.
These people are hotheads a bit quick-tempered, but they cool down as quickly.
Don't forget!
We're south of Marseille.
Anyway, make sure the troops aren't trigger-happy.
Break some skulls if you must, but no fire.
That's an order.
I don't want any violence.
Understood?
No more violence.
It cooled down after a month.
Mar. Pélissier died from pneumonia. The Arab Kingdom policy had its first setback.
Neither Jews nor Arabs wanted to give up their special status in exchange for French citizenship.
Only 200 Arabs out of 3 million applied for it. Aïssa was one of them and had his own reasons.
- Thanks but I don't drink.
- Of course.
I came to ask you for Jeanne's hand, officially.
My regiment leaves for Mexico and we would like to be engaged before I leave.
Aïssa. You and Jeanne cannot marry.
Why?
You're too young, practically brother and sister.
A Kabyle proverb says, "Marry within your tribe,
"within your village, and if possible, within your family."
You belong to different worlds.
What?
I'm French now.
Yes, but you're also Muslim.
Do you know the obstacles you'll be facing?
Jeanne will want a church wedding.
What will your family say?
- There're other mixed couples.
- They're the exception.
Your friend Hélie Toussaint married a Muslim woman.
Yes, but he converted, and now stands disowned by his family.
Listen!
Let's not beat around the bush. Is it yes or no?
Aïssa. I'd like to say yes but it's impossible.
Believe me.
Trust me.
It's no, then.
What if we eloped without your permission?
I forbid you.
I get it.
My Arab blood was acceptable on the battlefield.
In Paris, they saw fit to grant me French citizenship.
But they forgot to tell me it was a second class passport, because here in Algiers, I'm always an outsider, a native.
Even for you.
It's all clear now.
I'll wait for you.
When you return, I'll be of age.
I'll leave home.
We'll marry and live in France.
We still have to wait.
I'll wait for as long as it takes.
Napoleon III came to Algeria twice to proclaim himself King of the Arabs.
He was delighted.
He ate ostrich eggs, roasted gazelle and lion meat.
Everywhere, huge Arab crowds cheered him.
Our paper had to concede his great success, organized, it must be said, by the Arab Office.
Hélie acted as his interpreter throughout his stay.
It was his hour of glory.
He thought he'd seen the dawn of the Arab Kingdom. History decided otherwise.
Look at this!
Four years of drought, famine, cholera, and grasshoppers.
All at once in just 4 years.
Look!
They're eating grass, roots and even leaves.
People are dropping like flies from hunger and cholera.
Where are the French doctors?
Cholera isn't racist. Frenchmen have died from it too.
Even Bugeaud died from it in Paris.
Did you see how the peasant treated me?
When you privatized collective land, you broke up the tribe,
It's the price of progress and of a fairer, modern society.
Do you know what they did with the arid land you gave them?
They sold it to the colonists for a pittance.
People here are superstitious.
They're saying the Arab Kingdom has the evil eye.
I'm sorry, but all you've done for us is turning against us.
All the same, you can't blame us for drought, grasshoppers, and disease.
Bad luck hounds us.
People say it's God's vengeance because we didn't defend our land against the infidels.
Tell the governor that if France does nothing, there'll be war.
- Warn him.
- I will.
Tell him that I lost a son... to cholera, and that my youngest might go into the mountains.
- You know what that means?
- How is she?
- It's cholera.
Quick. She's being waiting for you for 2 days.
My son... apple of my eye.
- You came to say farewell.
- I'm here.
You'll pull through.
It's too late.
God picks the hour and mine has come.
I've a secret to tell you.
A secret?
Yes, Aïssa. One that I've carried in my heart since you were born.
Odilon is your father.
You mustn't marry Jeanne.
Forgive me, Aïssa!
I mixed infidel blood... with that of the true warriors of the faith.
I was young, a harem slave.
During the Tafna peace,
Odilon was Abdelkader's doctor.
You were born after that.
Hadj Hamou raised you. He taught you to walk, to ride a horse, and to use a sword and rifle.
He taught you right from wrong, and courage.
He taught you the true religion.
He's your father too.
Stay with me!
Stay!
I had made a promise.
I will always be fond of Jeanne.
Promise me never to tell her.
I promise.
If it does, I'll fight by your side.
You can't, Aïssa.
That'd give you away.
Have you forsaken your religion?
I haven't.
One day, France will allow its citizens to be Catholic, Jewish or Muslim.
France... maybe.
But we won't here, son, not on Muslim soil.
You're French now.
You must leave and fulfill your destiny.
I am French.
But my heart will forever be in Algeria.
You're hiding something.
What's going on?
Is it another woman?
Is that it?
Be honest.
I'm getting married.
What?
My mother has chosen my future wife.
I cannot refuse.
It's tradition, you see.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I don't care.
What'll you do, all alone in Paris?
Where will you stay?
With Aunt Inès.
I'll take a job as a nurse.
I'll treat the wounded on the front.
I'll defend France.
You're lying.
You want to go with him.
You want to be with your Arab!
Throwing yourself at him like that!
How dare you?
Look at yourself.
A Kabyle raped your grandmother!
You're an Arab too!
The bad Arabs like raping women like you!
Jeanne...
Our armies are getting defeated everywhere:
Wissembourg, Reichshoffen-Froeschwiller...
What a disgrace!
What possessed the Emperor to wage war on Prussia?
Bismarck was waiting for it.
New headline!
The Emperor was captured and abdicated.
Gambetta declared a new republic.
A new republic, my friends!
Follow me!
Saïd? I couldn't believe it.
The Emperor had been captured.
They'd declared a new republic.
My old dream had finally come true!
I'm the lieutenant commander!
You should leave before my friends get here.
Listen to them. They're jubilant.
Don't be a hero, it's best you flee.
Where's Toussaint?
Where's that sly fox?
Vanished.
We'll get him sooner or later.
While the French are fighting each other,
- let's throw them into the sea.
We must save the Arab Kingdom.
They say they're republicans, but you know them.
They're colonialists, arabophobes...
Let's rouse the tribes and drive the French out!
- Cowards!
- Listen to me!
We've talked enough.
I'll rouse my troops and fight!
Come with me to Oran, Bahia.
You can't stay in Algiers.
Bahia...
I beg you...
Do this for me.
It's too dangerous here.
I'll try to go to Paris on my own.
Meet me there.
I love you.
The French government has fled to Tours.
By God, France is collapsing!
We should declare independence.
Send us Garibaldi and Algeria will take care of itself, just like Italy.
You want us to fight 3 million Arabs all by ourselves?
- What are the other wires?
- Nothing important.
Say, what do you think of...
What's wrong?
"On the front, the incredible bravery "of the 'Chasseurs d'Afrique, ' Algerian soldiers and Zouaves,
"cost them dearly.
"The second 'Turcos' was bled dry.
"Its officers were killed in action."
Shit.
The second "Turcos..." That's Aïssa's regiment!
Friends...
Military rule is over.
Algeria has been split into 3 departments governed by French law.
The departments will be run by a prefect and by members of Parliament.
The governor-general must now be a civilian, under the Ministry of the Interior.
We've won, my friends!
Algeria is both civilian and French!
A French Algeria!
- Long live French Algeria!
- Wait. Settle down. There's more.
The 33,000 Algerian Jews are now automatically French.
- Will we be allowed to vote?
- Of course.
- What about the Arabs?
- Not for now. Phew!
My heart stopped.
Shut up!
Thousands of "Turcos" and Zouaves died on the battlefield. They voted with their blood.
A minute of silence for our Muslim brothers who died for France.
Why did you keep that from me?
I had made a promise.
How could you keep such a secret to yourself this long?
"Dear father, "you reading this letter means I was killed in action."
"Don't cry.
"I'll gladly give France the life you've given me "that has nothing left in store for me.
"I will finally rest in peace "under the watchful eye of the 2 Gods who ruled "over my life and death."
"The almighty God of the Arabs, who controls good and evil "and the merciful Christian God "who can forgive every sin."
"I'm writing you to remind you of your promise."
"Jeanne... "must never find out."
"Never."
"Farewell.
"Your son, Aïssa."
What happened?
Why did he reject me?
Hey Arab!
Stay where you are!
Don't move, Arab!
- Yes?
- Open up!
I didn't know where else to go.
Come in.
Oh, it's you.
Where's Bahia?
She went to Oran with her father.
Why didn't you take her with you?
I'd have looked after her.
Have you eaten?
No.
I'm not hungry.
I'll go make your bed.
You can't stay in Algeria.
They'll kill you.
You can spend the night here. Tomorrow, I'll put you on a boat to Spain.
I paid half already.
Give them the rest when you arrive.
This is a safe-conduct.
Just in case.
And a pistol.
It could come in handy.
Thank you.
- What a beautiful country.
- Our country.
- What happened to us, Odilon?
- Life.
Do you remember Ménilmontant?
Uniting the East and the West?
Why did you forsake our ideals?
They were utopian.
The Arab Kingdom is not utopian.
Just the opposite. It's realistic.
You'll see it too one day.
Why do you force your ideals on me?
Mine are as good as yours.
I want this land to become a part of France, of Republican France. Freedom, equality, fraternity.
Freedom? Or the right for the strong to oppress the weak!
Not necessarily.
Republican education will turn these Arabs into good French citizens.
It'll take time, but I'm optimistic.
They should become good Algerian citizens, instead!
You're bound to fail!
The future will decide.
- God will decide.
What happened to Toussaint?
I never saw him again.
I'm told he went back to Algeria.
How come?
He followed his own path, alone, which doesn't surprise me.
You never saw him again?
Wasn't he a friend?
You see, we never parted ways.
You know, we need utopians, dreamers.
The world couldn't exist without them.
Excuse me, I must go now.
It's rather cold in here, wouldn't you agree?
It is.
After a while, the cold gets to you.
It's just awful.
Translation:
Previously on Childrens Hospital... 18, 19, 20.
Ready or not, here I come.
Gotcha!
Aah!
You peeked.
You were peeking.
I wasn't.
Let me see.
You're a cheating bitch!
Come on.
Nice try, Eric.

Looks like somebody's having a bad head day.
Detective Chance Briggs, you old bucket of shrimps.
What's my old partner doing here?
The yoozh.
What's with the water coming out of the face?
He was my ex-boyfriend.
I loved his head. The victim had his head ripped clean off.
Look familiar to you, Maestro?
Looks an awful lot like that rash of murders 15 years ago.
Those were all boyfriends of yours, too, right, Cat?
It's almost enough to make a girl stop dating.
Or only date guys you want to see dead.
Can you find the person who did this?
Not on my own. I'm gonna need some help from my old partner.
I haven't been a cop for a long time.
It's in your blood, your glands.
I could smell it in you on our first day working together.
_
Detective Briggs?
I'm your new partner, Owen Maestro.
Ugh!
Rookie move, Maestro. Never let your guard down like that.
But section 19/a of the rule book says --
The rule book's never been out on the streets.
Sometimes, you got to bend the rules.
Sucker punch!
Sucker punch! But that's not what we learned at the academy.
The academy doesn't know crap.
Just ask the rule book. Release.
So, what's our assignment?
The Childrens Hospital murders.
They just found a fourth victim decapitated like the others.
Four decapitations, huh?
These victims sound like the Beatles of decapitations.
The Fab Four -- without heads.
I mean I've heard of "Help," but this is ridiculous.
Mop tops? How about no tops?
You know that song "Come Together"?
Well, this is like "Come Apart."
You know.
"I Want to Hold My Head."
"...on, so it doesn't get cut off."
This band is not gonna have the Talking Heads for an opening act.
- Let's go.
Which one of you is in charge?
Well, that couldn't be me.
The only thing I'm in charge of is this.
Hey, uh, boss!
- These guys want to talk to you.
- Okay. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Hi. I'm Brad Lendricks.
I'm the head paramedic.
What do you want?
It's about the recent killings at the hospital.
You mean the ones due to the serial killer or medical negligence?
Let's save the snaps for "Yo MTV Snaps."
Word is the paramedics are the eyes and ears of the hospital.
Brad can't help you.
No, he's always been mysteriously missing whenever a murder happened.
If you'll excuse me, I have to go stand over there.
If you ask me, Brad's glad all those guys got offed.
See, he's been in love with Cat for years, but she refuses to go out with him.
And now he's got a clear playing field.
A clearly stated motive.
Still, we need some solid evidence.
All we have on the guy is what this bald asshole told us.
No offense -- I'm sure you have some really great qualities, too.
I'm just going off of first impressions.
You know, I've always wanted to be a doctor.
Ever since I graduated medical school.
So, did you ever become a doctor?
Yeah. I've been a doctor for 15 years.
Oh, yeah, right.
That is not good enough, okay?
I want these tires to be white!
There's more urine where this came from.
There's that paramedic.
How do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago?
Chet Mandvanteussen?
Just do it better next time.
We want to talk to you about the murder of Cat's most recent boyfriend.
You've done pretty well for yourself, haven't you, Mandvanteussen?
You're head paramedic now, your own ambulance, your own assistant.
Maybe. Doesn't mean I killed Cat's boyfriend.
It could have been anybody.
What about former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice?
Okay. Not her.
One down.
About 6 billion to go.
We need the personnel records on everyone who's worked here in the past 15 years.
I'm sorry.
Any files over 14 years old are converted into microfilm and then shipped to our storage facility in the Deep South where they are then destroyed.
I wish I could be more helpful.
_
Turn up anything?
And lots of it.
Just like we found at each of the other murder scenes.
Yeah, and according to the lab, all the semen samples came from the same person, probably male.
I would say definitely male.
My guess is Lendricks, but we can't know without a sample of his semen.
Detective?
I'm on it.
I like your haircut.
Thank you.
Got it.
What is that, some kind of time machine?
This is a cutting-edge device used to identify DNA.
Welcome to the future, my friend.
And now I'll just call the lab.
What is that, some kind of time machine?
It's the new Motorola clamshell, Briggs.
You never seen a cellphone?
Sure, but if I need to call someone, I'll use a pay phone.
This is more than just a phone, partner.
Look -- time and date.
Good God.
I guess it is a time and date machine.
We got a match.
- Chet, are you cleaning that gurney?
- Yes, sir! Hold it right there.
You're under arrest for the murder of --
Whoa! I want to talk to a lawyer!
The only lawyer you'll be talking to is one appointed to you by the court.
Veteran move, Maestro.
Wrong seat.
Could you get in the back, please?
Oh. There we go.
Watch your head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, girls.
Zoe, thank you so much for your note.
That was so sweet.
Lendricks.
Last time we saw you, you were a man.
What?
Shut up!
I made a deal with the District Attorney to be sent to the women's prison --
Better food, less athlete's foot, and the sex is amazing.
What? Anything goes!
We think your old assistant Chet may be copycatting you.
I didn't do it in the first place.
Wait. What?
Your semen was found at every crime scene.
Semen, semen, semen, semen!
I used to masturbate in the closets at work.
Is that a crime?
In Iraq, yes, and also here.
Okay, all I ask is that when you find this guy, you clear my name.
Except for the masturbating part.
I did do that, and I want that credit.
Look at us, huh?
Working a case, just like the first day we met.
Actually... It's time I told you about the real first day we met.
What's happening?
The year was 1992.
During my junior year at Oberlin, I took a part-time job at a veterinary hospital -- the night shift.
It was just me and the animals.
This is where he figures out who the murderer is.
As the months progressed, I had to figure out a way to pass the time...
You stupid ape.
You missed a straight diagonal move.
...but I was bored, so, of course, I started dressing up this one baboon in human clothes.
Just one more thing.
My name is Chance Briggs.
- Very good.
- Briggs. I own you.
Own.
Me Owen.
Sure.
You Owen.
I'm gonna call you Owen.
Owen! That's right.
- Owen.
- You Owen!
- Me Owen!
- You Owen.
You were a monkey.
That explains so much.
Like how I have no human relatives.
And how I always think of you as a god.
Yep. Monkeys are capable of many things.
Too bad they aren't better at solving crimes.
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured it out.
I think I just solved both cases.
If you're right, then I'll take back what I said about monkeys not being good at solving crimes.
My partner needs to ask you some questions, Chief.
If you don't cooperate with us, ma'am, We're gonna have to take you down to the station for questioning.
Don't you get it, Briggs?
That's not Chief.
That's not Chief one bit.
That's a baboon.
I won 10 large at the track, monkey.
Be back tomorrow before post time.
- Crap.
- Wait a minute.
What's this money doing at your desk?
Okay, you got me.
I dress up this baboon to fill in for me when I go to the track.
It's an old chief surgeon's trick.
I've been doing it for 15 years.
Your days of monkeying around are over.
Yeah. It's gonna be a real hard day's night for you.
Let it be.
A baboon is so strong, they could tear a man's head clean off his body.
Which is exactly what he's been doing... for 15 years.
Isn't that right, fella?
And there's your confession.
You're in big trouble.
Why?
Is replacing yourself at work with a monkey a crime?
In Iraq, yes.
But not here, so...
Actually, I guess you're not in trouble.
Great.
Thanks, guys.
How did you figure it out?
Sherlock Holmes once said,
"When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, is most likely a monkey."
It takes a baboon to know a baboon.
Sure does, partner. It sure does.
- Owen, no.
It's just a siren! - Aah! - Aah!
Aah! - Really?
! Really? !
- Heel! - Aah! Aah!
- Release! Release, buddy!
No, bad Owen!

Hey.
I'm looking for the call room.
Down that hall, hang a right.
Mozart.
29th symphony.
Who's conducting?
Dr. Hamza. It's brain surgery.
Huh.
In c minor.
Impressive.
Still, give me Dean Martin every time.
Thank you for the directions.
So, everything that you'll need to get you through the next few hours...
A survival kit. Thank you.
Saltine crackers, fruity lip balm.
Who are you calling a fruity lip balm?
Sour candies to absorb the toxicity.
Oh, Gatorade?
Sudoku?
Our kids are almost identical. See?
Great minds think alike, huh?
Guess you don't need me at all.
No, sweetheart.
You are exactly what I need.
Thank you for this.
Yeah.
Okay.
Onwards to chemo.
If you're looking for the call room, you already passed it.
Well, Charlie Harris.
How'd you know?
Oh, same old Bishop.
Brilliant with a scalpel, lousy with directions.
Well, some things never change, like your handwriting.
Still chicken scratches.
That's what makes me so popular with the staff.
So, I guess the rumors about you joining us are true, then?
Yeah, after training in L.A.
Got tired of bleach-blond nurses and gunshot wounds, huh?
- Never a dull moment.
- No, not with you around.
Buckle up...
Medics are coming in hot with two cirque performers who just fell 20 feet.
Illyana!
Let's go.
Illyana!
Uh, Jeremy Bishop.
It's my first day.
Zach Miller.
Welcome.
So, what happened?
He fell off a trapeze?
Kind of fitting for your first day.
I'm more of a high wire myself.
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.
All right, what's your name?
Kurt.
But you have to help her.
His aerial partner's a minute out.
Cirque de ciel, huh?
I used to date a girl from the Yorrick Company.
She was a contortionist.
Yeah, you're right...
Some things don't change.
Illyana!
Illyana?
Relax, relax, relax.
- Please, I need to see her.
- Just relax.
Calm down for me, Kurt, all right?
You guys got him?
Yeah!
Okay, 1 milligram of ketamine for the pain.
Okay, Kurt.
Hey, hey, Kurt, Kurt, look at me.
Out of the way, please.
Look at me.
I need you to focus, okay?
Can you wiggle your fingers for me?
Now your toes.
That's very good.
Okay, I need to reduce this hip.
All right, I'll stabilize.
Hey, bear with me, buddy.
That should give you enough torque.
Okay, relax.
Relax your leg.
Relax your leg. Okay.
Kurt, I'm gonna be putting your hip back in place.
You're gonna feel some pain, followed by a pop, all right?
On three.
One, two, and three.
Okay.
And like a glove.
You should put on some doctory clothes.
Greatest show on earth, right, Charlie?
Yeah.
Spine's intact, but... she's unresponsive.
I'll have her tested for brain death.
Illyana?
Illyana?
S04E08 Waiting on a Friend
- It's half past already.
- I'm sorry!
We got back late from the cottage.
Um, we were supposed to study before rounds.
I know, but it was so hard to leave.
It was beautiful there.
Except for the mosquitoes.
They were huge!
You should have seen the size of them.
They were like vampire bats.
And for whatever reason, they were only biting me.
You should see my back.
I'm covered in bites.
I can't stop scratching.
Except some of them, I can't really reach 'cause they're in the middle of my back.
Would you mind rubbing this bite stuff on me?
Oh!
Who are you? !
- I'm a doctor.
- So am I!
Good!
So why are we yelling? !
I...
Ooh!
I want to be with her.
I'm...
I'm sorry, that's - that's not possible.
She's gone.
I know.
[Inhales sharply but I...
I should be with her.
It's... it's not fair that she's alone.
Right.
Well, I'm...
I'm gonna make sure you have a chance to say a proper goodbye, all right?
Um...
I just need you to lift up your arm for me.
Kurt, did you know that Illyana had agreed to be an organ donor?
Yeah, of course.
We signed our cards together.
Okay, well, of course, we're gonna need a final consent if there are any family members.
There aren't.
I'm her only family.
Well, Illyana is gonna be able to help more people today than she ever could have imagined.
What do you mean?
Um...
Illyana is a match for a patient waiting for a kidney transplant.
That patient's fiance wanted to donate his, but they weren't a match.
But Illyana is?
Yeah, it's... it's actually...
It's even better than that.
See, the, um...
The patient's fiance has agreed to... to give his kidney to someone else, and that patient's donor partner has also consented.
We call all of this a domino transplant.
Basically...
Four people are gonna have a second shot at life today, and three people are willing to put their lives on the line... all because of Illyana.
Seriously, are you...
Are you hearing this?
Uh...
It's nothing.
Um...
Okay, I'm...
So why don't you get some rest, okay?

- Shahir.
- Hm?
Second aerial performer...
Female, 26, brain death.
She's on life support.
That's awful, Alex.
She's an organ donor.
Okay.
Who's O-neg with a 6 antigen match.
Shahir, she's the perfect donor for Terry Brown.
You're talking about the domino transplant?
When's the last time you saved four lives in a single day?
We'll need to organize our surgeries so the wait time for each recipient is as soon as possible.
They'll need to be off of dialysis and ready to go as soon as their organs arrive.
We'll also need a team to confirm that the recipients are prepped and in the O.R. By the time their kidneys arrive.
This is Keith.
He's our last recipient.
But he's in severe renal failure and can't travel to Hope Zion, so we will coordinate with St. Donald's to deliver his kidney.
This is all hands on deck.
I'm gonna bring in the junior residents.
Williams and Mirani will keep things moving.
We'll get Sekara to be our gopher for the day.
The most important thing to remember is, we've got one shot at this.
Seven surgeries.
Four harvest and three transplants in the next few hours before the final kidney goes to St. Donald's children's hospital.
If something goes wrong with one...
And the dominoes stop falling, so no screw-ups.
Everyone, Dr. Jeremy Bishop, our newest gen-surg on staff.
- I'm Alex.
- Reid.
Yeah.
You need no introduction.
Charlie's told me a lot about you.
Thank you for diving in.
Some of our junior residents.
Check the board, make sure you know where...
How are the bug bites?
We'll be the first in the city to lead a multi-hospital domino transplant.
Doogie.
How's it going?
Okay, Maggie, take Dev and start the first harvest.
Cassie and Asha, I'll need you to coordinate.
I'll be handling all of the transplants.
Dr. Bishop, want to do something fun today?
Giddyup.
Wait a sec.
Everybody huddle in. Come on.
"Domino" on three.
Three, two, one...
Domino!
Whoo!
I've always wanted to do that.
Dr. Kowalski, phone call on line 1.
Dr. Kowalski, line 1.
What year is it?
Sorry?
The magazine.
Uh...
Uh, 2003.
Why would we want to read articles from so many years ago?
You know, we're cancer patients, not historians.
Josh Lewis, professor of 18th-century poetry.
Or, well, I was until...
Has the, uh, has the nurse been in yet?
No.
It's hurry up and wait.
Well, they have to test our blood first, so...
Yeah, make sure it's okay to poison it.
Yeah, the irony's not lost on me.
But, then, nothing about this place makes any sense.
I mean...
I mean, I know...
let's get all the sick people, we'll put them in one place, and then have them treated by some semi-socialized beaker head with a God complex.
Sorry. Didn't catch your name.
Dana.
But most people around here call me Dr. Kinney.
Dr. Kinney.
Look at that.
What's the news, Dawson?
You're good to go.
Let's get you started on the docetaxel.
Yum, yum.
I'm a doctor, too.
Doctor of old poems.
You writing a book?
Trying to.
Thought I might have at least one great novel in me.
Although, now it turns out it might have to be a novella.
Or it might just be, you know, a professional hazard.
Teaching all that great literature, making me think I can do it, too.
Speaking of professional hazards...
Doctor becomes a patient, huh?
Mm.
All done.
You're next up, Josh.
You guys need anything, I'm your gal today.
Thank you, Dawson.
You know, it must be hard, knowing all the facts, to still believe you can actually beat this.
I'm putting both of you under at the same time.
No food, no drinks, so finish up your beers, boys.
You ready to get off dialysis?
Hell yeah, he's ready.
We got a wedding to plan.
So, we got transport on standby to take your kidney to St. Donald's.
Dr. Reid will be with you shortly.
You ready, Erin?
My twins turn 7 next week.
I've been on dialysis since they were 4 years old.
So yeah.
I'm ready.
It's been a long road.
Thank you.
We're just waiting for your donor.
Larry's not big on cellphones.
All he's got is this old flip, and the battery's always dead.
Well, time is of the essence, Emma.
He can't just disappear like this.
He'll be here, honey.
Larry doesn't have time for a lot of people, but his big sister's one of them.
Nobody can help an old guy with a chair, huh?
- Larry!
- Larry.
Must've passed a dozen orderlies schlepping this damn thing.
You'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before Liz Taylor here.
Got your chair.
Larry...
They found a donor.
What?
I'm getting my kidney.
The right donor came in to trigger the domino chain.
It is our lucky break.
Well, I...
I wasn't expecting this today.
Well, yes, I know.
This is all coming very fast.
But we need to move now.
We'll get you into surgery shortly.
But, uh...
I was just reading this thing online.
A guy gave his kidney, and... and, um...
He developed an unexplainable appetite for pumpkin pie.
Wouldn't eat anything else...
Just pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie, day after day.
I hate pumpkin pie.
Are you seriously talking about pie right now?
I...
I just need time to process this, Emma.
Dr. Reid, Maggie sent me down.
Something wrong, Dr. Reid?
It's fine.
Just try to relax.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
It's the cadaveric donor.
We lost the right kidney.
How bad is it, Maggie?
Right kidney's lost blood supply.
It's a goner.
Left one is hypoplastic.
So, we are looking at a small kidney with a crazy arterial network.
Might be too many to anastomose.
Well, Terry's prepped.
They haven't opened him up yet.
What do you want to do?
I promised four patients they were getting off dialysis today.
That is still the plan.
Okay, we will cut a piece of her aorta, use it to make an arterial cuff around the renal arteries, and then we'll have one in anastomosis instead of three.
Okay.
Go get ready for the next harvest, please.
Mm-hmm.
Somebody page Dr. Bishop.
All right, ureter is free.
Just the artery cuff to go.
So, the weather's great in L.A. why'd you come back?
I tried an emergency spinal corpectomy on a 15-year-old car crash victim.
Did they die?
No.
No, I saved her life.
And I still got sued anyway.
Wow.
That is rough.
Yeah.
They had more lawyers on staff than doctors.
Suction.
I wasn't getting any better...
Just safer.
From everything I've heard about you, caution isn't really your thing.
The way you're working those scissors, I'd say it's not yours, either.
Okay.
Here we go.
Got it.
Start perfusion and get it ready for transplant.
Kristine.
Oh, hey.
Have you, um, seen a, uh...
Uh, yeah.
I've seen her.
I've been hearing her all day, too.
Yeah.
I've been trying to talk to her.
No, she doesn't want to talk.
I don't think she wants any help at all.
Okay, well, what does she want?
Uh, well, what do you know about her?
Uh...
She's a trapeze artist.
Her and her partner took a bad fall.
He managed to pull through, but she's having her... harvested as we speak.
Ohhh.
That's so sad.
I-I think I actually know the song.
"My pigeon home," it's called.
It's a lullaby.
- Lullaby?
- Mm.
So she's trying to put us to sleep.
Not working.
Well, it's a song about reuniting.
I think she might be trying to convince someone to join her.
When we met, I was the water boy for my high school basketball team, and I got stuffed in a locker after practice.
Did Dan save you?
No.
I was in the one next to him.
Sounds romantic.
Oh, it was.
Took three hours till the janitor found us.
What were you screaming, again?
"My legs...
I can't feel my legs."
Sounds hilarious.
We knew if we could make it through high school together, we could make it through anything.
So far, we have.
Time to go in.
Take good care of him.
Don't tell me you don't know the story of Abelard and Heloise.
No, but I have a funny feeling you're about to tell me.
12th century, Paris.
Heloise is this whip-smart student who wants the answer to human existence.
Well, that was her first mistake.
So she goes to study with Pierre Abelard, who's the greatest scholar in France at the time...
About 20 years her senior.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, it was for her Uncle Fulbert.
He found out about their affair, beat the living crap out of Abelard.
The lovers were banished to live apart forever.
They corresponded by love letters for the rest of their lives.
So?
What do you think?
Do you ever stop talking?
Um...
When I'm sleeping, I guess.
Oh!
Well, then, night-night, professor.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You want one?
Not unless there's weed in them.
No way.
Which part of "I'm a poetry professor"
didn't you understand?
Well, then, what the Heloise are you waiting for?
Pass me a pot cookie.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
Dr. Reid.
Pali.
What's up?
I wanted to give this to her.
Or to him...
whoever's donating to Erin.
The donors are all anonymous.
I can't give you a name.
I-I know, but the girls made me promise that I would give it to the person that helped their mommy get better.
Right.
I will see what I can do.
Thank you.
You don't know what it's like sitting there helpless while your best friend just gets sicker and sicker.
Of course you know what it's like.
You're a doctor.
I...
So you get why it's so important to me that that gets to Erin's donor?
Uh, yeah, just...
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Larry?
Oh!
Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Why?
I'm not doing it.
I thought I was ready, but I'm not.
I only came in today to drop off my sister's chair.
Okay, I know that all of this has been sprung on you, and you're probably incredibly overwhelmed, but...
All due respect, you have no idea what I'm going through.
I made a decision.
I'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone.
Don't let him leave the building.
- Berger is still in the building.
- What?
That was Zach.
He spotted him pacing by the coffee kiosk.
Which means he's waffling.
Yes, which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his latte to get him back on board.
All right.
I got this.
Hey, Larry.
Hi.
How do you know my name?
My name's Dr. Bishop.
It's my first day here.
Congratulations.
I'm leaving.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just...
Just hear me out...
Just for a second.
I just moved back here from L.A.
I was there training under this Dr. Pearlman.
Amazing surgeon.
Genius.
Also... a very pious man.
And he taught me a lot of things.
Including this Hebrew phrase... "tikkun olam."
It's from the talmud.
It means "repairing the world."
Says all of humanity has a shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.
Why are you telling me this?
Dr. Pearlman, he'd remind us about "tikkun olam"
before every surgery we did.
Larry, I think you have a chance to heal the world today in the simplest, most pure kind of way.
And I know you're scared.
I get that.
I really do.
I swear.
But I think it's something worth considering.
And I don't think you'd still be here if you didn't think so, too.
My mind's made up.
The answer's no.
I'm sorry.
No.
So, there's these, um...
Hm?
Um, you know...
You know...
Double doors... the kind that open in the center, and, um...
But one of the hinges was broken, so... they...
they kept that locked.
But he didn't know that.
So, anyway, you know, he's finally ready, and he's got, you know, his tray of cheese, you know, it's just right.
And he's carrying it like it's, you know, the most precious thing in the entire world.
And then bam!
His nose goes into the glass, tray goes everywhere.
There's, like, honey all over his beard.
Oh!
Oh.
I've come unstuck.
Oh!
Whoopsie.
Hang on.
Oh!
- What the...
- Here.
Let me.
Here.
Should you be doing this?
Why not?
Because I'm a...
What'd you say?
A beaker head with a God complex?
No.
'Cause you're higher than a lab monkey.
What is going on here?
Um...
Relax.
Josh just popped his I.V.
I got it back in.
No, you can't do that.
I'm sorry, but this isn't your charge, Dr. Kinney.
The hell it isn't.
I'm a surgeon.
Not in here, you're not.
Then what am I?
I'm sorry?
If I'm not a surgeon, well, what am I?
A dead duck.
That's...
That's what he said.
I didn't...
That's what you implied.
In here, you're just my patient.
Right.
So, what are my chances of surviving this?
Dr. Kinney.
No, seriously.
I have a reoccurrence of stage 3 metastatic breast cancer, so what are the odds I'll be here...
By Christmas?
That's not fair.
You stay out of this.
As your patient, Dawson, I am asking.
I do...
I...
I'm not...
I don't feel comfortable answering that.
No.
Of course you don't.
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I didn't mean to be...
You're all good now, Josh.
Thank you.
Okay, then.
Um...
I'll be back in a bit to check on you both.
Great.
Where did you two meet?
Uh...
At auditions for cirque.
Two total misfits.
Her parents, Russian immigrants, kicked her out of the house when she was 14.
Mine... hardly even noticed I was gone.
She understood me.
Yeah, I guess when you meet someone like that... who gets you, quirks and all... nothing else really matters, right?
Dr. Harris?
Time of death... 3:13 P.M.
Kurt?
Let's get him back to his room.
Okay.
I don't believe it.
It's my fault.
I pushed him too hard.
It's no one's fault.
He's never been very good with surprises.
When we were kids, I used to jump out behind corners, and one time...
She popped out, and I hit her square in the mouth.
15 stitches.
I told you he'd come 'round.
You were right.
I am scared.
I've been scared my whole life.
You've always been this golden child...
Good grades...
Good friends.
We'll give you two some privacy.
I've always been this neurotic mess.
That's not true.
It is.
Everyone thought it was a joke when I said I would donate.
But you stood up for me.
We're in a good place, Emma.
I don't want it to stop.
It won't.
You're my brother.
That is never gonna change.
Ohhh, boy.
Uh, hey, Alex, I need you to come take a look at this.
What do we have?
A frozen kidney.
Larry put us behind schedule.
It must have been too close to the ice for too long.
Even if we thaw that, we've got little chance of getting it to perfuse.
We've come too far to turn back now.
So, what do you want to do?
Get me 10 bags of warm saline.
And a blowtorch.
Kidding!
Hold the blowtorch.
All right, then.
That freezing didn't do us any favors, but the warm saline flush... It looked good.
You think it'll live?
It has to.
Okay.
Suturing the renal vein.
Okay.
Renal vein and artery are anastomose.
Okay.
Moment of truth.
Let's release those clamps and pray that it takes.
Exactly.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.
We got good perfusion.
Yes!
Yoooo!
Hey, do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis?
I have to go check in on Larry, make sure he's all right.
You got it.
Thanks, Bishop.
How did it go?
This is odd.
What?
He should be waking up now.
Heart rate's skyrocketing.
Alex?
He could be having a stroke.
Page shahir.
Let's get him up to imaging... now.
Okay.
Good catch, Alex.
It was a stroke.
He's coning.
The swelling from the epidural bleed is pressing on his brain stem.
There.
That should relieve the pressure.
Alex, it's okay.
You can go.
I've done plenty of these.
Turn up the music, please.
Thank you.
My daughter, Molly, is, um...
studying psychology at Queens.
She wants to be a couples counselor, of all things.
I haven't told her yet...
That it's back.
Toughest thing in the world...
Watching your kid trying to be brave...
No matter how old they are.
Especially when you know the real truth.
Yeah, I'd like to apologize for that.
No.
Why?
It's the truth.
Okay.
Then I say we - we double down on this... "Stranger on a train" vibe we got going here.
Let's tell each other one thing that we've never told another living soul.
Okay.
Yeah?
Who goes first?
I don't know.
You want to rock, paper, scissors?
Oh, careful.
You're gonna pull out your I.V. again.
I'll go.
I don't want to do this again.
I don't want to sit here, getting sicker and sicker.
I want to...
I want to get on a plane.
I want to fly away.
Your turn.
Well, I want to come with you.
If looks could kill, I'd be the ghost right now.
Well, look at it this way.
What would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep Alex away from you?
So, how do we help her if she won't talk to us?
I don't know.
You know, maybe he doesn't see her, maybe he doesn't hear her, but if he feels her, if he senses that she's here...
Then what?
He won't move on, either?
He won't get better?
That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
Charlie.
I'm just saying, it's not very scientific.
No, look.
Illyana, you need to talk to us.
He needs to be with me.
It was your time.
It's not his.
You need to accept that.
He won't make it without me.
He's gonna have to try.
I won't go without him.
I can't.
Something's wrong.
Illyana, what are you doing?
I love him too much.
His heart rate's through the roof.
You need to go now!
I can't.
I won't.
He's got a petechial rash.
We need to get him to radiology right now.
Could be a fat embolus in his lungs.
Bone marrow may have seeped out of the break and migrated.
- Can you fix him?
- I don't know.
Come on.
Illyana!
Stop!
Call the code.
We need a crash cart.
Look, Charlie.
Code blue, E.T. wing 203.
Code blue, E.T. wing 203.
Kurt never had a chance.
I'm really not in the mood to see the bright side.
People who love each other that much belong together, even in death.
I'm not buying that.
Sorry.
I had a daughter.
Maddie.
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.
Not even happy hour.
This guy's all over the road.
He's coming right at us.
I tried to get out of the way, but there wasn't enough time.
We didn't...
we didn't have enough time.
My little girl.
Kris.
I wanted to die... so I could be with her.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
When I woke up in the hospital...
She was gone.
But there were all these other spirits that only I could see.
There's still so much I'm trying to figure out about this...
This thing we have.
Well, maybe we could help each other, you know?
Figure this thing out together.
I'd like that, Charlie.
Last ones.
I'm glad to see you.
Yeah, model patients.
Transplants went off without a hitch.
Pali, your kidney is taking a little trip to close out the domino.
It's going to somebody who desperately needs it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You were badass, Alex.
Yeah, she's not wrong.
All right, girls.
On to recovery ice cream.
Ahh!
So?
So, he's gonna make a full recovery.
Thank God.
One more transport to go, Alex, and you've pulled it off.
Not me... all of us.
Hey.
Nice ride.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
How'd it go?
Exhausting, but, um... eventful.
Alex.
I met a boy.
At chemo?
Yes.
And he's a poet.
And he asked to come to Paris with me because he wants to show me where Abelard and Heloise are buried.
Dana.
And I said "yes."
You just started chemo.
I know, but I'm...
I'm thinking that I just have to fight this in a different way for a while.
I'm sorry, but this is insane.
Actually, I think this is the sanest thing I have done in a long time.
You're flying off to Paris with a poet that you met a few hours ago.
Well, when you put it like that...
Instead of prolonging your life...
Alex.
I don't want to prolong my life.
I want to live it.
Hey.
How you feeling?
Like I just got run over.
You?
Same.
I wanted to, um...
Well...
I, um...
I wrote you something.
Oh, it's a... - Limerick, yeah. - Yeah.
Uh...
It was the only rhyme scheme I could remember, and I'm half-Irish, so...
"A terminal lass from Kilbride was befuddled by fear and by pride."
Hm.
"Till she heard a sweet man say he'd come with her partway.
So she kissed him, she smiled, and she cried."
Thank you, doctor.
So...
How does it end?
The story?
Oh.
- Heloise.
- Right.
Does she find the real meaning of life?
Oh, she does.
Oh, yeah?
The love she found with Abelard...
That was the meaning of human existence.
Oh.
Love.
Hey. What's going on?
Nothing.
You ready?
Look, I get it, Greg is your Jacob, but we all know you're going to end up with Edward.
Because you're Bella.
What is that reference?
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's...
Twilight.
Twilight, yes.
It's only the greatest love story
- since Shakespeare... In Love. - Right.
Yeah.
Right, yeah, okay.
What are you talking about again?
You spent Thanksgiving with Greg, and that was not part of our plan.
You need to be with Josh.
If not for you, then for me.
- Why?
- I need this.
My marriage is like The Walking Dead, okay?
We are all just trying to get out alive.
You and Josh, your love story... it gives me hope.
What love story?

Okay!
We get it!
Oh, is that Greg again?
Look at that.
He has texted you six times already today.
Yeah, because he is my friend.
We're friends.
We're gonna go to a movie as friends.
It's like he's a stalker.
Okay?
No one likes a stalker.
The eagle and the bitch have landed.
Really?
Let me see.
Let me see. Let me see.
Um, Joshy, do you need, um, glasses?
Because the door is right over there.
Oh. My bad, babe.
Okay, well... I hope they like the rice cooker I got them.
Everyone likes rice, right?
It's a very versatile grain.
What?
Are you crazy?
You don't want them snuggling up over the one dish that connects their cultures.
I'm gonna go give them this gift. Okay.
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Forget the gift.
Forget about the gift.
I am just trying to snap you back into reality, because now that Josh and Valencia are living together, you are not gonna have any more alone time with him.
Well, you know what?
I just want him to be happy.
Oh, my gosh, Joshy, I'm so glad we finally moved in together.
It's the beginning of our happily ever after.
Yes, it's cool.
Plus, we'll be close to...
Marriage?
Kids?
I was going to say Taco Bell.
There's only one thing missing.
The salsa?
You just ask for it.
No, furniture, Joshy.
I mean, we don't even have a dining room table.
But we'll get one.
Let's burn sage.
Shoot, I forgot to get that.
Joshy, I needed that sage to cleanse the house of evil spirits.
Ghosts are obsessed with me.
I'll get it right now.
I love you.
Ugh, I hate her.
She's worse than all the Kardashians combined.
Except for Caitlyn, who is a national hero.
I'm just gonna call Josh and see if it's cool that I come over.
Do you need me to call Valencia from a burner phone and tell her there's been a murder at the yoga studio so you and Josh can have more alone time?
You came up with that way too quickly.
Oh, he pressed "ignore""
Oh... oh... that doesn't feel good.
It's fine, it's fine.
He's busy.
I get it, I'm busy, too!
I won't even think about it.
I don't want to feel this way.
I reject this feeling.
I respectfully decline this feeling.
Hey, here she is!
Here's my MVP.
You ready to kick butt at that meeting?
Calvin Young is the most important potential client we have ever had.
I'm joking.
I mean, he is.
I mean, landing him would make us West Covina's premiere law firm.
But, by the time you knock his socks off today, wine and dine him over the weekend and then do your presentation on Monday, he will be... Putty in our hands.
- Oh. - Are you okay?
I mean, you look a little peaked.
Never felt better. Uh-huh.
I definitely won't press ignore... on this case.
What?
"Mr. Young, I know that you have your choice of law firms
"to represent you in this matter
"of Josh moving into a new apartment with his hot girlfriend... " No!
I typed that?
_
Well, then, why do I have you in the office?
Huh? Gotcha there, bottle.
And here's a health messages from TV's favorite doctor.
Do you know the signs and symptoms of the dreaded panic attack?
Well, if you don't, you need to join me for my week long marathon where I'm gonna teach you how to identify the symptoms, such as shortness of breath... heart palpitations, the urge to self-medicate with drugs and booze.
He's here!
Whole firm is counting on you.
Okay, I'm coming.
Scott, I am asking you to drive carpool for one day.
I do it every day.
Oh... fine.
Fine, okay, whatever, I gotta go.
It's nice to... feel appreciated.
Your perfume is delightful.
Thank you.
I rubbed a magazine on myself this morning.
Well, it smells like a cherub dancing in the morning dew.
I'm Calvin Young.
Paula Proctor.
Welcome to Whitefeather.
Are we, by chance, going to the same meeting?
Follow me.
Calvin Young.
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Karen, the case assistant.
Please excuse my handshake.
I have naturally damp hands.
It's a medical condition.
I am in some studies.
Shall we be seated?
You okay?
- May I get you some coffee, Mr. Young? - Yes.
Uh, French press, if you have it.
French press.
Mr. Young, we are so excited to have this opportunity to bring you into the Whitefeather family.
'Cause that's what we are.
A family that can help you acquire the industrial acreage you're looking for.
Well, I am pleased to be here, Darryl.
Well, we are determined to show you everything that we're capable of.
And to do that... I can think of no one else but our closer.
Um, why don't you take it away, there, Rebecca?
Would you please take it away?
Welcome, Calvin.
Oh, my God, your teeth are blue.
Have you been drinking the water from the toilet?
Oh, crap.
It's ink.
Must've been from my pen cup.
Welcome... to Joshfeather.
White... feather.
Oh, God.
What happened to you in there?
That's not the Rebecca I know.
I mean, something is wrong.
Karen said that she smells vodka on you.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Vodka doesn't smell.
Listen, Darryl, I know I didn't bring my "A" game...
I think you need to go home.
Wait, are you taking me off the case?
Please don't take me off the case, because if you take me off the case, that means I'm not working and if I'm not working, that means I have to think thoughts.
Okay, you're not off the case.
But go home and work on the presentation.
And then, when you come back on Monday, I want you to be the happy Rebecca that we all know and love.
Such a good tip.
So helpful.
"Be happy."
Hi, Paula.
Hey, are you okay?
I got back with Calvin's fancy coffee and Darryl said you weren't feeling well and you went home.
Yeah. Yeah, my blood sugar was a little low, so I decided to just come home and really focus on the presentation all weekend.
Hey, are you sure you're cool to do the Calvin dinner without me?
Well, I'll do my best.
Okay. Uh, I gotta hop off.
I'm really working hard here.
Bye!
It's important to deal with one's feelings head-on, because repressed feelings lead to depression.
What do you know?
Repression equals depression.
That is...
_
I'm tired, too.
_
I'm depressed, too.
Man... the French really know how to make depression look sexy.

♪ My lips are red from pain ♪

There is nothing sexy about depression, Rebecca.
Listen, you better get your act together, young lady, or you're gonna run this new life off in the ditch.
How did you get in here?
Well, your depressed mind invited me in.
And by the way, this place is a dump.
You ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something, anything?
Maybe a mural?
I don't know about this.
Are you sure this is the dining table she wants?
I don't know.
- I want to surprise her.
- Surprise her?
With furniture?
She's very picky, dude.
Yeah, yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage.
You bought the kind you put in food, not the kind you scare ghosts away with.
Valencia's intense, bro.
As sexy as she is, she's intense.
She has final approval over all your clothing.
Yeah, you know... yes.
I really miss your cargo's.
We all do.
Guys, I'm committed to this relationship.
I want to contribute.
You know? She's done everything.
She picked out the apartment, she booked the moving trucks.
We're supposed to be a team and I want to do something for her.
So we gonna do this or what?
Yes. Yes, we are going to do this.
Guys, we can bang this out.
According to this, it is a very simple - 72-step process. - 72-step process.
Oh, hell no.
Okay. We're not doing that.
We lost Hector.
What are you looking for?
Oh, my God, you're still here.
Tell it to me straight.
Am I schizophrenic?
I'm not really here.
I'm just in your imagination.
I mean, let's face it:
you do have a very active imagination.
One minute, you're walking down the street, the next minute, you're in a big musical.
Although, I gotta say,
I did love the pretzel.
You did a good job on that one.
Aw, it's a shoelace tip.
Ugh, that's gross.
Oh, my God, you're looking for prescription meds in a drawer?
So?
Listen, when I moved here, I thought I was okay, so I dumped them all my meds and now, you know, I realize that I'm not okay.
I mean, look at me, I'm falling apart here.
This is really bad.
So if I can just get my old prescription meds back, I'll be okay.
Uh, here's a thought.
Anxiety, depression... how about you see a doctor first?
I'll go do that.
Ten steps ahead of you.
Thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice,
Dr. Akopian.
What can I help you with?
I'm not myself right now.
We're always ourselves, Rebecca.
Right. Yeah.
No, so I don't feel like myself.
This isn't usually how I am.
Like, I'm normally very organized and focused.
Sounds like you're feeling out of control.
Let's delve into your childhood.
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.
Okay, so, I've been through the therapy wringer,
I've rehashed my childhood a ton.
And I don't really want to do it again.
Like, for me and for you, frankly, I don't want to put that on you.
So here's what I need.
I need these.
Those are the meds I was on in New York.
Oh, my God.
How did your body react to all this medication?
You must not have been able to feel a thing.
Exactly.
Numb as they come.
So... scribble scribble on your pizzle pad.
Rebecca, your doctor in New York is a quack.
He gave you a Band-Aid, not a cure.
My method would be to do some digging and figure out what's really going on inside your mind.
And then we can discuss the appropriate medications.
So that's great, but I need to be better by Monday.
It's a work thing, so... We doing this?
No, we're not.
Okay, well, you know what?
You'll be hearing from me on Yelp.
Um, where is your rest room?
Say, what time is your husband joining us?
He bailed at the last minute.
He has rehearsal for his singing group.
And that's more important than this?
I don't mind.
I'm fine.
He does what he wants to do, I don't care.
I do what I want to do, he doesn't care.
It's basically the storybook romance I dreamed of as a little girl.
Aw, you see? You guys get each other.
That's so cool.
How are my eyebrows?
Don't care.
They can be wonky.
Few people know this, but bald eagles aren't bald at all.
You see, the name actually derives from a word meaning "white headed."
And being a "white feather," well, I've always felt very connected to our national bird.
Actually, it's my spirit animal.
May I just say this is an adorable red?
Unconventionally alluring, with the soul of a poet.
Thank you.
I got it at the gas station, but in the ten-dollar bin.
In the future, you really should try some of the Arizona wines.
Blend those with a smooth Camembert... Mmm! Heaven.
Oh, I am imagining that.
Mmm... Camembert.
It's fun to say.
Oh, you know what?
Let's play a game.
You tell me everything about you, - don't skip a thing, go. - Okay.
I was born in Irvine, California.
Um, my favorite color is green...
- Not you. - Oh.
Ladies first.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
You know what? Calvin, you're the guest, so you should go first. Go ahead.
Okay, well, um, I was born in Prescott, but I knew a small town wasn't for me, so I moved to the big city.
- Phoenix?
- Tucson.
Right.
Yeah, and I, uh, met my lovely wife.
Ten years of bliss... and then she died.
It was a, uh, short and tragic illness.
The last thing she said was...
"Calvin, "be happy.
"Take life and... and grab it."
And you should.
You should take whatever you want.
Just take and grab.
I'm gonna roll.
Okay, let's see... pink pill with the number 55 on it...
Yes!
ADD medication.
I've always wanted to take this.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
Do-do I really need to tell you don't take a pill you found on the bathroom floor next to the toilet?
Here me out, Dr. Phil.
It improves focus and promotes goal-directed behavior.
That's exactly the mojo that I need.
Rebecca, I know what it says, and I know what you need.
You need to focus on this:
Josh could find you if he wanted to.
You have made yourself really easy to find.
You have been rejected.
Rejected.
He doesn't want you.
That's reality.
Deal with it.
No. I'm not gonna listen to you.
You talk silly.
Oh, my God.
Oh, what's that, little pill?
"Eat me, Rebecca"?
Well, I think I will.
Pills don't talk.
Don't take it.
She took it.
Let's get to work.
All right, let's see this presentation...
What is Karen doing?
She put two spaces after a period.
What is this, 1997?
Well, those have to go.
Okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kicking in right now.
And what are these, Oxford commas?
Well, those have to go, too.
I just gotta edit this whole thing before I even start.
I would love to show you around tomorrow morning.
There's, um, the Chino Hills State Park, the Azusa Fish Canyon Falls.
May I be so bold as to inquire your availability and whereabouts tomorrow afternoon?
Uh, what?
Do you like jazz?
Hot jazz?
Is there any other kind?
There's a small place in South Pasadena.
My friends who blow horn say it's the best little jazz boîte in town.
Would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth licks?
- I would. - Mmm.
I would.
Uh, but he's, uh, busy.
He's... with rehearsal for his singing group.
He's always busy.
And, you know, he's not much of a licker.
What time do you want to pick me up?
Okay, so I've been up all night and I hung the fish, painted the walls, put up the mural, cleaned out the fridge, redid the grout in the bathroom and for the finishing touch...
You're gonna be so excited!
Christmas lights!
So, may I ask who's crazy now?
I never said you were crazy.
That's a derogatory term and I don't think it really applies to you.
Where were you in my senior gender studies class?
We'll talk about that later.
For now, it's time to get down to business.
But you know, before I get down to business, I'm just gonna see what my friends are up to.
Instagram, oh!
Valencia posted a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom.
It says ♪Christened...
How nice.
Oh, nice to hear.
How's that working for you?
I don't understand your question.
But you know what, I'm starting to realize that maybe that pill was not what I needed.
Oh, there's a shocker.
Just spare me.
Spare me the wisecracks.
Hey, it's me.
You got any downers?
Is this enough of a downer for you?
Oh, my God.
I could just melt into the chair, like, like a butter lady.
That's good.
No, that's bad.
Because I can't get work done right now.
Oh, I have an idea.
It's the most fantastic-iest idea.
That's not a real word.
Seriously, seriously, seriously.
Seriously, are you busy right now?
Honey, hi.
Yeah, I-I'll be home in, like, an hour, tops.
Thanks, Booboo.
Valencia's so mad at me.
We've been here all night, and I haven't even finished sorting the screws.
Josh, there's still time to bail.
On the table, I mean.
We were friends with you before we even met this table.
Uh, the truth is none of us really even
like the current table.
I hate this table.
We don't like, um, this table.
And you're going to ruin your life if you stick with this table.
Bros before... tables.
I think it's a nice thing you're doing.
Nicest thing I ever did for a girl was pull out.
Hector?
She has tandem parking, so after I'm there for a while, I have to pull out.
Which is such a pain, 'cause it feels so great just to leave it in there.
The worst is when it's alternate side of the street parking, 'cause then I got to park it in back.
I don't even get why there's a spot back there.
It's so tight.
Feels more like an exit.
So then I'm going front, back, front, back... and it's all dirty in the back, so when I move it to the front, then that gets all dirty.
I'm just happy I have a spot at all.
'Cause I used to have to pay.
Well, that was edifying.
This burrito is a symphony.
Dr. Akopian's gonna be so happy to see me.
When I pop up, she's gonna be like,
"Whoa, you're so chill!
I'm gonna give you all the drugs""
Well, I want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around. Hmm.
I bet her vacuum cleaner is filled with cool pharmaceuticals.
That's such a good point!
I know.
I wonder what she has in there.
Dr. Akopian?
Dr. Akopian, it's me Rebecca Bunch!
I'm really cool and chill now.
Okay, not giving up, not giving up!
Here, Dr. Akopian?
Oh, my God, it's her prescription pad.
Oh, I see it!
Wait, she wouldn't have left it by the window if she didn't, like, want somebody to take it, right?
Yeah, it's like a wizard test.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, what are you doing?
You can't fit through there.
Yeah, yeah, I totally can.
Because look at me... Look how tiny I am.
I'm tiny...
I'm child-size.
I'm a puppy.
I'm a poodle. I'm a shrimp.
Yeah, I'm going.
Okay, yeah, all right.
Oh, no, I think I'm stuck.
Oh, we forgot.
You're small, but you got those British-nanny-sized boobs.
British nanny...
Hello, guv'nor.
Please, sir, may I have some pills?
Ah, your best table, please, sir.
Oh, I don't work here.
Oh, well, this will spot you till you get back on your feet then, huh?
Oh, no, I-I have a job.
Please.
Seat the lady, hmm?
Ah, I love jazz.
I mean, the Charlie Brown theme song, come on.
Ah, The Vince Guaraldi Trio.
Though some mistakenly think it's Brubek.
Welcome to Smoky Jazzzz.
My name is Ike.
Our specialty cocktail tonight is called The Chimney.
Mmm, well those sound good.
Uh, two of those, uh, top shelf, and, uh, make those, uh, chilled glasses.
Wow, you have all those fancy cards I see commercials for.
Well, I like perks.
I live for perks.

Well, this is a wonderful place.
I've lived here forever.
I didn't even know it was here.
Well, I've learned in all my travels all the cities, no matter what size has a hidden gem.
Well, where have you been, traveling-wise?
Oh, everywhere.
You name it, I've been there at least once.
- Paris.
- Well, not Paris.
- Rome?
- I'm more of a domestic traveler.
Right.
I've always wanted to travel.
Scott does.
My husband.
His barbershop quartet goes to places like Fresno and Bakersfield.
I would kill for a trip to Fresno.
Well, you deserve to go to all the places your heart desires.
Oh, you're very nice.

I'm not ready for this to end.
Are you?
You know I could
- have you both arrested?
- I didn't do anything.
I'm a student.
On what grounds?
Breaking and entering.
First of all,
I only half-entered.
And second of all, as far as the breaking goes, you have no idea of my intent to steal your prescription pad.
I do now.
But since you were both stoned when you broke in, and not in your right mind...
I'm willing to offer you a deal, Ms. Bunch.
Make an appointment and start to get help and I won't press charges against either of you.
Fine. Yeah. You win.
Let's do this.
I will come in here,
I will explore my feelings, do whatever you want.
Now can I have the drugs?
We're done here.
I'm done.
I give up.
I'm gonna take a nap here for just a... year.
What about your job thingy?
Oh, God, I hope Darryl doesn't fire me.
Do me a favor?
Can you get my phone?
I think it's in your purse.
I know, I'm just too tired.
Can you get it?
Just put it in my hand?
Just place it inside my hand.
It's coming.
Place it inside.
- There.
- Thank you.
Hi, Paula.
It's me.
Yeah, okay, listen, I got something to tell you.
I'm not proud of it.
I cannot do the presentation with Calvin on Monday.
Can you tell Darryl for me?
I'm-I'm actually with Calvin, so I could just tell him.
What?
We are at the hotel on East Cameron and he just went out for ice, and I only have a second.
Hotel?
Why are you at a ho...
Is that Anita Baker playing in the background?
Oh, oh, he's coming back.
I gotta go.
I need a cab.
Uber.
I need an Uber.
Oh, okay.
Actually, no, forget the Uber, it's just around the corner.
Come on!
I've never been in a hotel room with a couch before.
Uh, all the perks.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
It's like a fantasy... like strawberries and champagne is just gonna magically arrive at the door.
You didn't!
Don't do it!
Look at that.
It's beautiful!
She's gonna love it.
I-I feel so great about this.
She's here. She's here, guys.
Mwah. Okay. Okay.
What?
Left.
What is it?
Is it a puppy?
Babe, what am I looking at?
Surprise!
It's your new dining room table.
We stayed up all night making it for you.
- That you didn't pick out.
- And I helped.
That's so sweet.
So, do you like it?
Well... it doesn't match our other things.
It's not exactly what I would've picked out.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's... not something you want, I mean, I guess I...
You could take it apart and give it back?
Josh, you are so smart.
That's a great idea.
Give me a kiss.
I got to go back to class, you guys, but thank you so much.
Oh, and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table.
Yeah? Okay. Bye.
She scares me so bad.
Look, Paula,
I know your marriage is crap.
I get it.
And I get that you're about to have the hottest sex of your life.
Mmm.
Right. So why are you stopping me?
Because it's not real.
It's a Band-Aid.
You know that.
Remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality, right?
And I didn't get it?
Now I get it.
You're doing the exact same thing.
You need to face your real problem, and your real problem is that your marriage is dead.
And you need to fully feel that, and you need to face it, because this is just a temporary fix.
It's like a pill you found on the bathroom floor.
Who would take a pill they found on the floor?
Look, look, I've spent my whole life numbing myself, okay?
I have spent my whole life escaping to far-off places, and it's only recently, like, now, like, literally this second that I realize, like, I can't do that!
I can't do that.
I have to feel my feelings.
It's okay to feel, Paula.
It's been five years since I made love without the TV on.
And ten years since somebody held my hand.
I-I miss my dead wife.
Come here.
Literally the most entertaining day of my life.
Rebecca, making a speech like that in front of a potential client, that... was brave.
Also a bit foolish.
In most cases, clients would run in the opposite direction.
And I understand if this means you don't want to work with me...
Look, let me finish.
You have the kind of no-nonsense honesty and raw emotional insight that I look for in a commercial real estate lawyer.
You are a wonderful woman,
This weekend has been so special.
But marriage is a precious thing.
If I could hold my wife for one more second...
Oh. Don't make me cry again.
Is this alpaca?
It's so soft.
My dead white wife loved alpaca.
What did you say to Calvin?
He was so impressed, he's not even seeing other people.
I mean, how did you swing that?
I just was honest about... about all the great work you do,
I just made him see what you wanted him to see, that we're a group of kick-ass lawyers and we're a family.
Feel your feelings.
Everyone should feel their feelings.
Everyone should always feel their feelings.
Well, I, for one, am feeling peeved, because this copier...
Cork it, Karen!
But this copier...
Cork it!
Rebecca, I'm very glad you're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself.
I am so grateful to be here, and I'm excited to face my problems head-on.
I know it's gonna be hard work, but it's work that I am prepared... it's work...
I'm sorry.
I know I should just... work,
I should make sure this isn't an emergency.
One second.
_
You know what, I'm feeling better already, actually.
So I'm-I'm gonna go to this very important thing, but I want to let you know that this is not over.
I'll see you next week.
What?
Get out of here!
A rice cooker?
That's perfect!
Because Valencia is Mexican and I'm Filipino and rice is a staple in both of our...
Cultures. Yeah. Right.
Uh, oh, sorry it took me forever to return your call from Friday.
Oh, my gosh, you... You're so busy.
Don't even think about it.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Anything.
Is this a nice table?
It's a perfect table.
That's what I think.
Thanks.
No problem.
Uh, hey, um, do you want to come over sometime, just check out the new place?
There's not a lot of furniture, so there's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our socks like in Risky Business.
Oh, my God, that sounds amazing.
Yes.
When?
Now?
Just, like, don't tell Valencia, 'cause she thinks it's stupid.
Well, Valencia's stupid.
Sorry. I'm sure she's smart in her own way.
But anyway I have the perfect slippy-slidey socks.
Number 31.
Oh, no. Don't you start with me.
Just keep walking, old man.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Get out of my life.
Oh, my God, uh, Dr. Phil.
I'm a huge fan.
- How you doing? - Oh.
I'm s... Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.
You're actually Dr. Phil.
In the flesh.
It's me.
Even Dr. Phil has got to have his boba.
I'm addicted to these things.
Maybe you should, uh, get help for that.
You guys make a really cute couple.
Oh. That's so funny.
We're not a couple.
No, no, no.
We're just friends.
That's so funny. He thinks we're a couple.
That's so funny.
We're not a couple.
He thinks we're a couple.
That's so funny, but we're not a couple.
He thinks we're a couple.
Yeah. G-Good luck to you, buddy.
♪ Mmm, it's the sexy gonna-do-it song ♪
♪ The sexy gonna-do-it song ♪

I hope... I hope you're cool with that.
Previously on "Angie Tribeca"...
She's awake.
- Sergeant Pepper?
- Angie.
- How long have I been out?
- About nine months.
Next you're gonna tell me you're seeing someone else.
Scholls thinks I had the baby with some chick in Canada.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Who's his mother?
Is that really important, who's his mother?
Do people really care who their mom is?
I'm ready to work, Lieutenant.
You just got out of a coma.
Hey, if Tribeca says she's ready, then she's ready.
Or do I have to show you my fist?
I was wondering if I could see the visitors log from when I was in a coma.
Has anyone here heard of the website "MeetNCheat.org"?
Their server's been hacked.
This is all the stolen data from the Meet'N'Cheat hack, names and addresses of all the members on the site.
They're making it look like the LAPD is publishing it.
My name is on the list.
Mayor Joe Perry.
Username...
MayorJoePerry1.
Password... "YesThatMayorJoePerry."
I'd like to introduce you to Special Agent Diane Duran.
So, Mayhem Global hires Duran to hack Meet'N'Cheat.
She draws us in.
Then she hacks us from the inside.
But why?
Sergeant Pepper. I know he's still alive.
If you're serious about finding Pepper, he'll meet you here.
I found out that the biggest criminal is not out on the streets.
He's in the mayor's office.
Mayor Perry?
Voter fraud, racketeering, money laundering, racketeering fraud, voter laundering.
The list goes on and on.
What about Mayhem Global?
I am Mayhem Global.
There's one number programmed into this phone.
When you're ready to be part of the revolution, call it.
What's the point of any of this?
We have evidence, a confession, and the bad guy doesn't spend one night in jail?
- That's the system, Tribeca.
- The system sucks.
Pieced it all together?
Almost.
Now I'm done.
Currently on "Angie Tribeca"...
You're just perfect.
We're gonna take such good care of you.
The Freezematic 15,000.
Once this bad boy gets going, it's gonna chill your milk, preserve your meat, call your sister, cure hepatitis.
Just sign there.
Yep. You're looking at 28 cubic feet of self-regulated, vacuum-sealed cold.
That's a separate produce crisper with an independent temperature control.
Check out this freezer.
A dead body fro...
That's not supposed to be there.
But I just plugged it in, and it's already ice-cold.
That's pretty good.
Tell us what happened.
Well, growing up, I always thought I'd be a pro football player, but I got a bum knee, so went into the family business... real estate.
Market takes a tumble, here I am.
How about what happened today.
Got up about 4:30, hit the snooze button... just the one time... got up, showered.
At work, sir.
What happened at work?
Let's see.
I got to where I pick up the truck for deliveries.
Finally.
I pull into the parking structure.
Level "A" is full, Level "B" is full.
Level "C", there was a compact spot, but I made it work.
What's the name of the company you work for?
Golden Gate Fridge.
I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Councilman Dreyfuss is airing out all of Mayor Perry's dirty laundry.
Is this who you want leading your city for another four years?
He actually has some good points.
It's too bad the old guy doesn't have a shot.
He'd need a miracle to win.
And what are the odds of two miracles in one month?
Not likely.
So, where are we on the body in the fridge?
We're waiting on Scholls for an I.D. and a cause of death.
I talked to someone at the refrigerator company.
They're gonna send someone out to talk to us between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00.
Wow, that's a huge window.
No appointments?
You can get a specific time, but you have to wait like three weeks.
Okay, so I'll have Tanner wait around for the fridge guy.
You guys check in with Scholls and see if she has a name for us.
Will do, Lieutenant.
So, I tried calling you this weekend.
Yeah, I dropped my phone in the toilet.
Total write-off.
And then I immediately got this new one with a different number.
But we're still on for bowling tonight.
Yeah, actually, I can't.
I dropped my bowling ball in the toilet.
Total write-off.
And then I immediately got this one.
But the guy told me to wait a couple days until the marble settles.
Ah, Tribeca, Geils.
Come with me.
I want to show you something.
Disgusting, isn't it?
- Horrible.
- A cat did that.
Anyway...
How can I help you?
We were wondering if you were able to I.D. the fridge corpse.
Ah, the very cold case, yes.
Come with me.
I want you to see something.
The deceased's name is Charles Michael Bucket, and his fingerprints match exactly those of a sailor who's been missing for three days.
- Navy?
- Worse. Coast Guard.
Dr. Scholls, can you show the detectives what you showed me?
Trying to make me jealous?
- Is that a whistle?
- In his windpipe.
And something tells me he wasn't born with it.
Although he did die with it.
We think someone shoved a whistle down his throat after a struggle.
You can see the defensive wounds here and here.
Why a whistle?
Someone trying to send a message?
Don't blow whistles?
Someone's telling him not to be a whistle-blower.
But what was he blowing the whistle on?
No idea.
We examined every other orifice several times but found no evidence.
We'll try and take out the whistle and see if we can pull some DNA.
Meanwhile, we'll go pay a visit to the Coast Guard.
The Commandant's a very busy man, you know.
We appreciate you getting us in, Petty Officer Snick.
Chief Petty Officer Snick, thank you very much.
And I thought you said you were coming at 2:00.
Isn't it 2:00?
It's 1:50, which means I only got a 20-minute lunch break, but whatever.
It's fine. I'll have a candy bar or something.
Sorry, Petty Officer.
We didn't think it was a big deal.
Detectives, Commandant Don Van Zandt.
Come in, detectives.
That'll be all, Snick.
You're welcome.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for finding Seaman Bucket.
We are a brotherhood, and when one of our brothers go missing, it hurts the whole Coast Guard family.
If there's anything that I could do to assist in your investigation, don't be afraid to ask.
Well, for starters...
I'm afraid that's all the time that I've got today.
CPO Snick will see you out.
We were really hoping to ask you some questions,
Commandant Don Van Zandt.
I know you were, Detective. I know you were.
You listen here, Popeye.
This is a murder investigation, and we're the murder police.
So start talking.
I think you're outside of your jurisdiction, Detective.
This is an internal matter for the Coast Guard, thus to be handled internally by the Coast Guard with no outside help.
All due respect, Commandant, this base is in L.A. County, so when somebody's killed in L.A., it is very much in our jurisdiction.
Now, we'd like to interview his bunk mates. We want to talk to the last person who saw him alive, and we want to know why he ended up dead in a refrigerator.
I don't know how he disappeared or why he ended up in that refrigerator or how he got that whistle down his throat, but if our investigation turns up anything of interest, I'll be sure to call you.
CPO Snick will see you out.
We'll see ourselves out.
Okay. It's my one job, but go ahead.
We need base access, we need to interview his shipmates, but the Coast Guard keeps shutting us down at every turn.
Because they know something that they don't want to tell us.
It's a classic case of keeping something secret.
If they want to get into a jurisdictional dick-measuring contest, I'm all for it.
It sounds like fun, and I like my chances.
Go talk to the Melanie Burke at the D.A.'s office and see if she can help us out.
Got it.
- Lieutenant. - Yep?
As predicted, the refrigerator guy came as soon as I got in the shower.
Damn it!
That's so frustrating.
It's like they know.
So I can either wait till tomorrow at the same time, or I can go to the warehouse in Long Beach and talk to them.
That's a hell of a long drive, but I don't think it can wait.
I'll be all right.
There's a Dave Buster's right next door.
Tanner!
I'm gonna go with you.
This guy's going to the chair.
As God as my witness, he's gonna fry.
Just backing up a bit, we don't know who did it.
Yeah, but we appreciate your enthusiasm.
Someone showed up to work today.
All right, what do you guys want, huh?
Just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna put it in your little hands.
All right? You want a court order?
You want a subpoena?
You want a grand jury?
I'm gonna get you a grand jury.
We're not quite there yet, Melanie, but good to know we have you in our back pocket.
All right, so hit me. Anything.
Give it to me.
Well, I guess we could start by getting subpoenas
- for some of Bucket's shipmates.
- Already done.
How about a search warrant?
Check your inbox. Already there. Did it this morning.
- Can I use your restroom?
- You just did.
- Validate parking?
- I would love to.
Parking.
Got here at 10:21.
It's 11:04 now, so that's... That's... That's 28... 28 minutes.
No, that's like 40 minutes.
Shh. Okay. These are 15-minute increments.
- There we go.
- We'll just pay.
- I got this.
- Please, just give us our ticket back.
Can you just...
'Cause I had it, and now I don't have it.
- Just give it back.
- This one is...
You can stick it together.
Ahh... Oh. They're not lickies.
It's fine.
This is great. Thank you.
Come on, guys! Hurry up!
I told you. I don't know anything about no body in no fridge.
So, no one looks into the refrigerators when you take them off the boat?
Of course. Every product gets quality-controlled.
Nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fridge?
When my guys checked it, there was no body, okay?
My guys know what they're doing.
Lieutenant, I'm gonna need you to look away for this one.
Mr. Sterelli, let me ask you something.
How do you feel about Dave Buster's?
It's the number-one destination for family fun.
- Everybody knows that. - Mm.
How about if I told you I had 5,000 tickets with your name all on them?
I'm listening.
Have you had any interaction with the Coast Guard?
They come around sometimes, make sure the shipments get through with no hassles.
What shipments?
They don't tell me nothing, and I don't ask nothing.
Every once in a while, a shipment of appliances comes off through the boat that I'm not allowed to inspect.
They put it in a Coast Guard truck and take it off my hands.
That's all I know.
Anything else, you're gonna have to ask the Coast Guard.
Thank you, Mr. Sterelli.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me!
Excuse me, seamen and women!
We're wondering if anybody has any information on the death of Charlie Bucket.
I got information.
But if you want me to talk, you got to beat me.
Not you.
The other lady.
Seaman Bucket was my bunk mate.
We were closer than brothers.
I know this is difficult, but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him?
No.
No idea.
He was a great sailor and really popular, although, the last couple weeks, it did seem like he really had something on his mind.
I'd say to him, "Hey, Charlie. You got something on your mind?"
And he would say, "Huh? What?"
Like he had something on his mind.
You have any idea what happened to his stuff... clothes, footlocker, detailed diary?
Yeah, I did find one detailed diary.
I didn't think anything of it at the time.
You want to take a look at it?
It might help.
Yo.
"Smash Mouth" is two words.
A Coast Guard truck? This late?
We should go check it out.
We don't have a warrant.
Oh, I think we'll be okay.
What the hell was that?
I can't wink.
Tanner, hit the siren.
Evening, detectives.
- Is it?
- How can I help you?
How's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look-see?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Detective.
I'm on official Coast Guard business, so unless you want to take it up with the President of the United States...
I'll do that.
President Obama, Lieutenant Pritikin Atkins.
Is it okay if we look inside a Coast Guard truck?
Thank you.
Good night, sir.
- Wait, can I talk to him?
- Oh. He hung up.
Is he buying it?
It's hard to read his face.
What's he doing now?
He's still looking with a suspicious look on his face.
What are you two whispering about?
Vitamins.
Ke$ha.
Vice President .45 says open the back of the truck.
Hey, how's it going, eh?
Are we in America?
Canadians?
What in the name of Tim Hortons is going on here?
Mr. President, we have a situation.
I didn't know the Coast Guard deals in the trafficking of illegal immigrants.
There's a lot you don't know, Detective, like how to apply eyeliner or who won Best Picture in 1984.
"Amadeus."
What were you doing with a truckload of Canadians?
Answer me!
Okay, you want to play that game?
Well, we just found your DNA on the whistle inside of Seaman Bucket's throat, so you're going down either way.
If you cooperate, maybe we can get the charges reduced.
I don't have to answer to you. I only answer to one man.
But there is one tiny bit of information you should know.
I have a horrible shellfish allergy.
- Whoa, put down the shrimp!
- Don't do it, man. No.
Put it down.
No. That's no way to go out.
- Nice knowing you, detectives.
- Not like this!
- Put the shrimp do...
- Oh, and Angie,
- Sergeant Pepper says hello.
- Don't do it, man!
- Dreyfuss for mayor! - No! No!
This is great.
Case closed.
We got our murderer, and we didn't have to watch a jury screw it up.
Who wants to see a flick?
This isn't over.
We have to go after Van Zandt.
There's a massive conspiracy going on here.
Officer Snick put a shrimp in his mouth just to protect it.
I don't want to do 3-D. It makes me dizzy.
We cannot trust the Coast Guard to investigate itself.
I'm not gonna stand here and watch this get lost in the shuffle.
Tribeca, the buck has officially been passed.
It's Immigration and JAG Corp's problem now.
We all want to put the bad guys away and see the good guys get it all wrapped up nicely, which is why I'm thinking we see "Jack Reacher" at 8:15.
I saw it.
Brown stuff. Rocks.
When did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good?
Sometimes I think we'd make more of a difference without the badge.
You've just been so different lately.
I'm still incredibly attracted to you.
But something's changed.
I'm in a bad place, Geils.
You don't want any part of this.
We're doing good, Angie.
We're making a difference.
At the end of the day, you just got to leave the job at the job.
You're right.
Guess I'm just having a bad year.
I'm gonna call it a night.
Angie, promise me you won't do anything crazy.
I promise.
Set a course for Dreamland.
Relax.
I'm not here to arrest you.
Or sleep with you.
Take me to Pepper.
Never.
Ahh, ahh, aah! Your feet are freezing!
Okay, I'll take you!
So, what are the Canadians for?
Are you putting together some kind of army?
Not soldiers.
Voters.
It's right up here on the right.
- Face forward.
- Thanks, Commandant.
I'm done with you.
Here's your chapstick back.
Drive.
Not until you tell me what the hell you're up to.
You know what I see when I look out this window?
No.
No more bullshit.
You're importing Canadians to vote for Dreyfuss? What is this?
Mayor Perry will not be the next mayor of Los Angeles.
He's gonna win. He's killing Dreyfuss in the polls.
Mayor Perry will not be the next mayor of Los Angeles.
One way or another, he's gonna lose, and there isn't a damn thing you can do abo...
I'm in.
Oh. Really?
I thought that was gonna be a lot harder.
Great. Good news.
Where do we start?
Just act normal, and at a certain point, the Commandant will contact you.
I'm really happy you're joining us, Angie.
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
Whatever happened with you and your ex?
Ex?
Oh, Greg, I'm sorry.
- Do you love her?
- No.
You forgive me?
Of course, I forgive you, Joshy.
Love doesn't work out for me, ever.
So you are unhappy.
Yeah. Duh.
Maybe it's time you see what else is in your life, besides Josh Chan.
Oh, my gosh, you have changed my life,
Dr. Dream Ghost Akopian.
You made me see past all of my delusions that were holding me back.

Valencia and you are staying together.
- No... I-I-I I gathered. - Yeah.
I get it and that makes sense, yeah.

She really hates your guts.
Understandable, and I will just have to transcend that.
I am trying to break free of anything unhealthy or damaging.
So, um, that starts with, uh, trashing these.
Unless you want them.
No, no, that's okay.
Although, um, you know, some of those are great angles that you can't get with a selfie, so, uh...
- Sure, yeah, yes. - Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay, well, there it is.
That's the last of the Josh Chan stuff.
There was stuff?
No.
Well, I guess I should go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, get out.
- Get out of here. - Yeah, yeah.
Bye, Josh.
Can I get another beer?
I'm trying to study.
Studying and drinking at the same time: good decision.
I know, right?
It's easy.
It's extension school.
I-I don't like to tell a lot of people this, but I got into Emory Business School.
It's a pretty good school.
They call it like the Harvard of the South.
I thought the Harvard of the South was Vanderbilt.
No. No. No.
Yeah, so I got into school, and then my dad got sick, so now I'm working my way through school here.
You know?
I can't be slinging drinks to losers until I'm like 60 years old.
Oh, boy, look at this.
Just what I need.
- Hi. - Hey.
I thought you drank at Home Base.
I drink anywhere, but I do my study-drinking here.
Got it.
Can I pull up a stool next to you, or do you want to... be alone?
I could go home and drink some mouthwash.
Mouthwash, wow.
That's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself.
Sad says the man with an open textbook... next to an open container.
This is fun.
I like this.
Do you want to hang out for a while and insult each other?
Ah, what would your girlfriend think about that?
Um, Heather?
Uh, yeah, no, we're done-zo.
Oh, wow. I had no idea.
Can I get you a drink?
Nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snark.
Wait.
Go back to the Heather thing.
Are you okay?
Let's-let-let's talk.
Talk is not on the bar menu, but we could ask.
Okay, so, yeah, here's the thing.
Old me would have been totally down for, like, an old-fashioned barb fest, but I've decided recently that I'm trying to change my patterns.
So I'm gonna go.
No, come on. Come on.
I'm a glutton for punishment.
Stay. Let's do this.
We can make bad decisions together.
We could run in traffic.
No?
Okay.
Boy, she really digs you.
She's in love with someone else, but I figure ten, 11 years of me trying,
I'm a lock.
Okay, what is happening?
Why are you throwing out all this Josh stuff?
I told you, I've gone cold turkey on the Chan.
I'm done.
It's not good for me, and you know that.
D... oh, G... you have to keep the macaroni portrait.
That took two weeks.
No, no, Paula, I'm breaking my old patterns.
Break old pat... I...
What does that even mean?
Did you go to a bumper sticker store?
No, I just realized a lot of things on my trip to New York, while I was in a bumper sticker store.
Okay, but you're right about this, actually, it has a lot of dry goods on it, it actually could be useful for my earthquake kit,
- so I will keep this.
- That's my girl.
But everything else goes in the trash.
- Hmm, hmm. - Oh, come on.
Not Channy bear.
I forbid it.
Fine, maybe I'll just put Channy bear on a high shelf in case of a... bear-mergency.
But the rest of this is going, bye.
- Oh, come on... - Bye, letters to Josh.
First drafts, second drafts.
- In the trash.
- No.
- Yep.
- That's...
- That's insanity. - Nope.
Nope.
Good-bye, Josh thong that I never wo... I don't wear thongs.
Why did I even get this?
You have finally lost it.
You have left the reservation and I-I can't... I'm not...
I can't watch it. I don't care. I don't care.
I'm not supporting this.
No, uh-uh.
Hey... I'm so nervous, aren't you?
That last test...
Was pretty easy, at least for me.
Wow, that's impressive.
You must be smart.
Yeah, well.
I-I don't like to tell people this, but, um...
Oh, you don't have to tell me something you don't like to...
I got into the Harvard of the South.
Emory?
You know it?
Emory?
The Harvard of the South is Duke.
No.
No, no.
Emory. Google it.
So, everyone, overall there were some nice efforts, but, uh, some of you, I'm sad to say, fell short.
I'm really not sure what rubric you're using to grade these, but...
Doesn't take much of a rubric to see that you didn't put in much of an effort here.
Oh, well, you know, I work full-time.
My dad is sick.
I work two jobs and my husband is dead.
I am very sorry to hear that, but I... was not involved.
Your next assignment is an essay due Friday.
You can do better, Mr. Serrano.
You got into the Harvard of the South, after all, which you somehow managed to mention on your test.
A multiple choice test.
So, you're busting my balls about an intro class at an extension school?
Cool, yeah. Makes sense.
Look, I don't know you very well, but from where I stand, it seems like you've made the choice not to try or something.
Oh, please, don't you worry about my decisions.
I will decide about my decisions.
Choosing not to try, Greg.
You got into Emory, Greg.
I mean, duh, I could have done better.
I could have gotten an "A" on that test if I'd wanted to.

You're an idiot.
Oh, my God, this is nuts.
Okay, you can't give up on Josh right now.
You are so close.
Paula, he picked Valencia.
Like, in front of my face.
Game over.
What?
No.
Game has just begun.
Okay, you have antibodies to his saliva.
You cannot give up.
You have traction.
He-he touched the side of your boob, I saw it.
- Can you get whoever that...
- Yeah, I will get that.
And... just... let's continue the convo later, okay?
And if it's the people across the street from that church, just tell them I don't believe and will never believe.
Rebecca.
Hello, everyone in Josh's family.
Hi.
Oh, my gosh.
I haven't seen you since the last book club.
I haven't seen you got engaged.
How does it feel?
It feels like I've been waiting seven years for Phillip to propose, because I have.
Let me see the rock.
Oh, my gosh, I mean,
Phillip said he was going for it, but...
He said you were so helpful getting it.
Oh, it was no problem at all.
I helped my client, Moshe, through a very complicated subdivision deal, and he said he could hook me up with non-blood diamonds at a discount.
And never pass up a good discount, right?
I know what you're thinking...
Like, diamonds, discounts, those are some like classic Jew moves, you know?
What are you doing here?
Jayma has something to ask you.
Look, I know that this is sudden, and we haven't known each other that long...
God, I feel like I'm proposing or something.
You've been such a good friend to the family.
You wrote Jastenity that letter to get into Harvard.
Unfortunately the letter was better than her application, but she did get into Cal State Northridge, which is the Harvard of Northridge.
Yeah, it is.
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, how would you like to be a bridesmaid at my wedding?
You mean, be an official part of the Chan fam-bam?
She'd love to.
You want me to be a bridesmaid.
Aw, you're such a lovely girl, Rebecca.
We would be so honored if you would become a part of our family wedding.
And you are the perfect height to pair with Phillip's friend, Daniel, who stopped growing after being a kid gymnast.
Um, actually, I-I don't know if I should.
Okay, hey, why don't we just... ?
O-One second, Chan ladies.
Come here.
One...
One-one second.
Okay, this would kill Valencia.
Dead.
Down in the ground.
Like a bug.
Legs in the air.
Now she's a ghost, boo.
Okay, but, Paula, what have I been saying?
I need to disengage and disentangle from dis family.
Know what I'm saying?
Seriously, I-I want to make amends to Valencia, and this is like the opposite of that.
Yeah, okay, well, who says no to being a bridesmaid?
You can't do that.
I mean, who does that?
Monster people.
- I have a question.
- No.
Is Valencia a bridesmaid?
Uh, not exactly.
By that she means no.
Like, ew, no.
Here's the thing, I-I'd love to be a bridesmaid, but I don't think it would be fair for me to be a bridesmaid and for Valencia not to be.
I guess you're right.
And Josh has asked for Valencia to be a bridesmaid about 50 times, so...
Great, so you get what I'm trying to say.
So you can both be in the wedding.
Sorry, what's that?
You and Valencia can both be bridesmaids.
That way you don't have to worry about her not being included.
Very wise, Jayma.
It's settled, then.
Yeah, it is!
I know you, from Spider's.
You were the sourpuss fighting with the girl in the shiny dress.
Hey, I'm, I'm not a sourpuss.
I'm pensive and deep.
Are you dusting potatoes?
I like to look busy.
Well, you're out of dark roast.
I can't study without dark roast.
Could you get on that?
Oh, yeah, sure, uh, no problemo.
Thanks.
She's cute.
Are we being pleasant now?
Sorry, I don't know your rules.
So, you two an item?
Me and Ally?
Oh, I wish.
She quit her job as a manager at a Whole Foods, came to work here.
I could not figure out why for the longest time.
And then I realized...
Hey, I know that guy.
♪ Grocery clerk with half an eyelid. ♪
His name is Brody.
I can't compete with him.
He has the flattop of a Greek god.
This!
Whoa, you are so good at magic.
How do you do it?
Uh-uh-uh. A true magician never reveals his secrets.
Come on, Brody.
So you like her.
Yeah.
I don't have a shot.
I mean, look at her.
I should give up.
I know that's the right decision.
Are you sure... she doesn't like you?
Watch this.
Ally.
Ally, though.
That's my type, too.
Oh, that's so hot.
Okay, bro, I gotcha.
I know exactly what you need to do.
So, you and Valencia are friends?
Uh, kinda.
I'd say we share a history of common interests.
Of course, she's late.
She's the kind of person that has to make an entrance.
You know what? I don't think that's fair.
I wouldn't stereotype her as someone that...
Oh, sorry I'm late.
I just had some pictures taken for my Hometown Hotties submission to Maxim.
We ready to try on some dresses?
Jas, come on.
Let's go pick out the first round of dresses.
This is beautiful.
- Hey. - Whoa!
Hey, Valencia, hi, oh, uh, this is going to be so fun.
Are you ready to be, like, bridesmaid buddies?
I want to make myself very, very clear.
I know what happened.
I know about the kiss.
And if it were any other situation, I would take off my earrings, my extensions, and my wings, and curb-stomp you.
Got it, that's fair.
But, for some reason, you're the one that got me into this wedding party.
Josh told me it was all you.
- He did? - Yep.
I mean,
I don't know why you did it, but I don't care.
Just stay out of my way and don't make me look bad to these people.
Hey, Valencia, I can do better than that.
I can make you look good.
Yeah, yeah, like, by the end of this, they're going to want to adopt you.
But maybe that's not, like, precisely what you want, but...
Oh, just shut up.
How about this?
This seems like a style that would work on everyone.
Well, most of us.
Valencia's right.
Uh, you know, uh, two-piece, halter, mesh dress might work well for you very lean ladies, but, yeah, not for this festival of back fat going on.
Okay, well, what about... this?
Oh, my God.
Those are such beautiful nipple covers.
Yeah, those would definitely cover most of my nipples.
Yeah, guys, let me remind you, I eat bagels at night...
Valencia knows.
She knows all about my night bagels... tell 'em, V.
Here's what you didn't know.
For my midnight bagel, I eat it with butter, cream cheese, and... bacon.
Seriously. S-R-S-L-Y.
Like, true story.
Okay, so why don't we try different styles in the same color?
That's a great idea.
That's so Ni...
You know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's, like, really gracious.
It is, actually, a, a good idea.
So you kids can go crazy with your halters and your sheaths and your cutouts, and I will wear a dress fit to upholster a chair.
And I will wear it with pride.
Rebecca, come on.
Yeah, you're not that disgustingly fat.
Aw, thank you, Valencia.
Thank you.
Paula.
What have we said about standing places, quietly waiting for people?
I forgot.
Okay, so how did it go with Valencia at the dress shop?
Did you find any weaknesses?
I was thinking that we could use your role as bridesmaid to really mess her up.
My first thought was poison oak in the dress.
Rashy nips, instant classic. Paula.
What?
We're not doing any of that.
- We're not.
- No.
We're just acting like normal people.
I'm going to be like any other teenage ex-boyfriend's sister's last-minute bridesmaid.
Yeah, so just be cool.
Understood.
I have my orders.
Where can a person buy poison oak, and what is the rashiest kind?
Richard Kind is a 59-year-old actor, best known for his role in Spin City.
No. Poison oak, rashiest kind.
Jim Rash is the award-winning writer of The Descendants.
Come on.
You're sure this is a good idea?
Dude, she doesn't like you.
She's shown no interest.
She's way into someone else.
Why give up now?
This is the right move.
Um, can I have everyone's attention, please?
Hey, someone's trying to let it rip here.
- Thank you, Greg.
- You're welcome.

Eh, can we get back to work, or am I boring you?
I'm sor... it's a... it's a bridesmaid text chain.
It's about... it's about the word "cummerbund""
It's... it's a funny word.
Sorry. Let's get back to the case.
The case? Who cares about the case?
When are you getting the bridesmaid gowns?
'Cause I got a guy in Maine who's going to send me some primo itchy, sticky plants.
And he said he was going to throw in a couple deer ticks for, you know, a little extra...
Um, what are you talking about?
Our plan - rashy nips.
- Oh. - I say we roll the dice for, you know, some possible Lyme disease.
I have so much to say...
Hold on one second.
Oh, oh, it's from Jayma.
It says emergency.
SOS. 411.
She means 911.
I wonder if Phillip got cold feet.
I have to go.
- What?
- I have to go, I'm sorry.
What about our plan?
There's no plan.
The dance we do.
- Hey, what's the emergency?
- I don't know, do you?
Guys.
There's something I need to tell you.
And it won't be easy.
My dress is done early, and I brought champagne!
Cheers!
Valencia's so funny.
Oh, Valencia, tell them about the part with the old lady.
Yeah, so, this 90-year-old lady was in downward dog, and I said to her, "Okay, just breathe into it."
And she said,
"If I breathe into it any harder, I'm gonna toot."
Oh, she's so funny.
She has a million yoga stories like these.
They're great.
Well, I've been practicing my humor.
I watched an online tutorial.
This was so much fun, you guys.
When Joshy and I get married, I want all of you to be in the wedding.
Except for you.
I mean, would it kill you to say something?
She's not wrong, Ruby.
You're a dud.
Ah, man, I am tipsy.
This was so fun.
Oh, Jas, we got to go meet mom at the cake-tasting.
Can you guys stay and make skee the dress gets packed away perfectly?
Like no wrinkles or bubbles.
Absolutely.
We're on it.
Valencia and I got this.
Yep, we got it.
Thanks, V.
You know, we all thought you were heinous, but you're kind of okay.
- All right, bye, ladies.
- Bye, Jayma.
Drink a glass of water.
They don't think I'm heinous anymore.
Jastenity even offered me a half stick of gum.
I said no because I bloat, but still...
Congrats.
Well, I guess we should, um, get the girls to pack up this big-ass dress.
Yeah, okay.
Wow, this would look even worse on me than some of the others.
Oh, come on, stop.
I mean, you make jokes about your body, and they're pretty funny and mostly accurate, but with your big boobs, that dress would look great.
Are you kidding?
No.
I'd be spilling out of this thing, and not like in a sexy, on purpose,
Christina Hendricks type of way.
So?
Guys don't care.
Guys love big boobs like yours.
I mean, sometimes I hate my small boobs.
I mean, I thought about getting implants.
What?
No, don't do that.
Oh, my gosh, Valencia, if you knew what went into having a pair of monsters like these, you would never think about getting them again.
I'm gonna show you.
Rebecca, you can't.
Valencia, once I put this dress on, you will never envy these puppies again.
Get ready.
There... yep.

No wonder my boobs are so small.
I have no fat on my body.
See?
Exactly.
Problem solved.
Now, you try on the dress.
Let's see how it looks with some nice B-cup action in there.
No. I couldn't.
Valencia, you're going to make a really beautiful bride.
Josh is really lucky.
I hope.
I hope some day it is Josh and me, I really do.
It will be.
And I'm so sorry if I did anything to delay that dream.
I appreciate you saying that.
Do you mind taking a picture of me?
Just for me.
I want to remember how I looked.
Of course.
Oh, I got nothing to work with here.
I mean, I've already hacked into Valencia's e-mails and her texts.
Ooh, wait a minute, what's this?
A photo stream?
Oh, again.
You with the face.
What do you mean, how did I get Valencia's password?
You know me.
Let's see what we've got here.
Valencia's photos... chocolate cake... fried chicken...
Oh, she just likes to look at food.
Oh, wait a minute, what is this?
I think that's Jayma's wedding gown.
You know, I've... I've prayed to God my whole life, and I, and I never knew if she was listening, but... thank you, Big Mama.
Uh, no wrinkles.
- Yeah, or bubbles.
- Thank you.
We got this.
It says I have a new like on a photo.
I-I didn't take a photo, what is this?
You ruined my wedding.
Yeah, bitch.
- How could you?
- What's wrong with you?
#HotterThanTheBride?
I-I-I didn't do anything.
I didn't post a photo.
And my hashtags are always positive.
Like, #GirlBoss or #Fitspo.
Someone must be framing me or something.
What kind of psycho with no life would do such a thing?
Oh, God, Paula.
You must have done it.
When I went to the bathroom.
This is why women don't go to the bathroom alone.
Excuse me, miss, I have a bone to pick with you.
I'm sorry, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, you can.
By helping yourself.
Stop chasing after the cartwheeling magician idiot boy, and start paying attention to the guy with the bountiful, beautiful hair, who happens to really care about you.
Oh, you're friends with Marty.
I prefer mentor.
Ah, well, I've already told him I'm not interested.
Him continuing to chase after me is a terrible decision, which makes me respect him even less.
I mean, maybe if he backed off and let me come to him, maybe I would think about it.
Otherwise, can you tell him to stop with the songs and the texts and the skywriting?
What did you skywrite?
Lyrics to the song.
Cost a fortune.
Oh, and it was so windy.
I basically paid for a cloud.
So what's next, coach?
What do I do? What's my next move?
I don't know.
I kind of think we do nothing.
I like that.
Like for a day?
We slow-playing?
No.
I actually think forever.
I think we got to call this one.
Go back to dusting potatoes.
You laugh, but who likes a dusty potato?
Marty, Ally's right.
Chasing someone who isn't into you is a terrible move.
Trust me, I feel you.
I've been there.
You mean you and Rebecca Bunch.
Your friends come in here all the time talking about it.
God, I hate my friends.
Yeah, Marty, that's right.
I did that with Rebecca.
But watching you do it, I see what a bad call it was.
Actually, I'm realizing, I make a lot of bad calls...
in everything.
Yeah, me, too.
And I think we're the same.
I mean, I work here in a grocery store, even though I went to Harvard.
The Harvard of what?
Just Harvard.
In Boston.
Your decisions are just the worst.
Look, I already deleted it, so don't worry.
And we only got one like and it was from...
OMG, it's from Maxim's Hometown Hotties.
I'm telling you, it was Rebecca.
She's been "Single White Femaling" me since she got here.
Valencia...
You take one step closer, and I'm getting a restraining order,
Jennifer Jason Leigh.
What I was going to say was, um...
You were right.
Yep, it was me.
Yeah.
It was my idea for Valencia to put on the wedding dress, and then when I saw her in it, I-I got jealous.
And so I, uh, I stole her phone and I posted the picture.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you.
Only someone crazy and sad would do that.
Um, yeah, and I'm both those things, so I'm, um, I'm sorry.
Valencia, I'm sorry we accused you.
Rebecca, you should go.
Yep.
Good-bye, Chans.
Before you start, you don't have to buy me champagne or a fur coat; just a simple thank you will suffice.
Paula.
Valencia's password was so easy.
Valencia1.
I mean, come on.
Paula!
Just get in my office.
I told you not to do anything.
Wait, what?
I mean, why didn't you listen to me?
Oh, my God, why didn't I listen to you?
Because if I listen to you, nothing would ever happen with Josh.
No Thanksgiving, no camp.
No kiss.
You, you didn't do all that by yourself.
And every time you said, "No, Paula, don't do anything."
And then I did anyway, and you were happy.
Wow, yeah, you're right.
Okay, that's the way it used to be, but it's not like that anymore, okay?
No.
Paula, listen to me.
I'm done with Josh.
Oh, come on, I saw you.
You can't even throw away the macaroni portrait.
- I threw it away.
Everything's gone. - Even Channy bear.
Yeah.
Channy bear sleeps with the fishes.
Nope.
I can't give up on Josh.
He's not yours to give up on.
Why are you so hung up on this?
It's for you.
It-It's to make you happy.
No, it's not, because I just told...
It's because...
If we're not chasing Josh, then you're not going to want to hang out with me anymore.
I know it.
What?
No.
Paula, no.
That's not true.
Yes. Yes, it is.
He's our glue.
He's what holds us together, and...
I've barely seen you this week at all.
Paula, I love you.
Okay, you know that.
But we have to stop.
It's not good for me.
You and I will always be friends, okay, I promise.
But we don't need Josh Chan.
Because I don't need him.
Hey. Hi. I'm sorry, I, um, I needed somewhere to drink, and I thought, I thought you'd be at school.
You're here.
What'll it be?
It's last call.
I guess, I don't know, I'll take some alcohol.
Do you know any alcohol names?
Yes.
I will take a peach schnapps on the rocks?
No, never mind.
Never order drinks again.
I'll make you something.
That's a lot of books you got there.
Yeah, I'm trying this really new radical approach to studying...
It's called studying.
Wow. Is it working?
Really well.
This is perfect.
What is this?
It's this really exotic drink called the gin and tonic.
Well, I've never heard of a gin and tonic before, but I think it's gonna be really big.
I'm sending in the patent.
Hey, what are you doing after this?
Do you want to, like, I don't know, go to another bar, get a drink, or hang out at my place, or...
What happened?
Did you and Josh get in a fight...
Is that what's going on?
And you need a shoulder to cry on?
So you come to Greg, 'cause that's what I do.
No, that's not what this is.
Rebecca, I would really love to hang out with you,
I would, but I know what that leads to for me.
And I can't.
I can't be in second place again with you.
Great.
Um, good to know.
I'm... I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
Greg?
Oh, Josh, I thought you were someone else, I...
What did you do?
Y-Y-You hacked into Valencia's phone?
Y-You said you were trying to keep your distance from me, a-and then you do this?
This is how you make it up to Valencia?
Okay, Josh, it's a long story, but all that matters is
Valencia is now beloved by your family
- and I'm out of the bridal party.
- Yeah, but...
Josh, focus on your girlfriend and on your family, okay?
And the next time you want to come and talk to me, don't just show up at my door.
Oh... okay.
Yeah, okay, cool.
Um, so could you go?
I-I-I have something I need to do.
Are you kicking me out?
Lil' bit.
Bye, Josh.
I'm sorry, Channy bear.
Hey, what's going on?
You okay?
What...
No, I c... I-I can't do this.
I-I can't eat a dusty potato.
Oh, God, is that what I taste like?
I mean, I, I ate a, an old French fry off the floor of my car, but I sh...
It's a metaphor.
Wa... you did what?
It doesn't matter.
No, good God, stop, woman.
Greg, listen to me.
This isn't about anyone else but you.
You're not second choice.
I promise.
Listen, if this is going to happen, - you need to know something. - Okay.
This isn't going to be like a roll in the hay and you go home.
This is going to be like three days of you and me just ruining each other.
And not emotionally.
Is that what you want?
When do we start?
I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
Me, too.
I mean, there's so many girls I could have brought here, like a whole bunch, but I chose you, Ashley.
- It's Ally.
- Don't care.
Can we have sex now? Yay.
Oh, my God.
You're an idiot.
And you're horrible.
Why do I always make the same mistake over and over again?
I make terrible decisions.
I go for the lowest form of man because I'm afraid to be with someone I might actually connect with.
You know what? Screw this.
I'm going back to nursing school.
Wait, do you want me to do another cartwheel?
I'm-I'm-I'm good at those.
Whatever.
She'll be back.
They always come back.
And now Behind The Wall, the making of Colony...
My fellow colonists, welcome to day 341 of our occupation.
Our choice is clear.
Resist or die.
- Roll sound!
- Take marker.
Action!
Colony, USA Network's blockbuster original series, is one of the most anticipated new shows of the year.
We came up with this idea of setting an occupation
- in modern day Los Angeles.
- It's current.
It's as if this happened now.
Legendary Television, part of the studio that produced Godzilla and Pacific Rim, and Universal Cable Productions, the studio behind the acclaimed original series, Mr. Robot, have teamed up with creators, Carlton Cuse,
Emmy award-winning producer of Lost and writer of the hit film, San Andreas, and Ryan Condal, screenwriter of Hercules, to bring you this compelling story of Resistance and Collaboration.
To be here, bringing it to life, and to see the scope and scale, it's the most awesome part of the process.
Over the next half hour, you'll get an inside, behind-the-scenes look at this intriguing new series, including interviews with the creators and cast...
I tend to like a big story that I can't even figure out myself.
...exclusive footage from the set and a sneak peek at the unique and amazing world imagined by the creators and crew.
They don't know this yet, so just between you and me, you know, and whoever is watchin', we'll let them know.
This is Colony-- Behind The Wall.
Get down!
You, come here!
What is this?
What are you doing?
- Come here!
- I haven't done anything!
You can't do this, please!
Colony is a story about occupied Los Angeles.
It's about family.
It centers around my family and our struggle to survive.
There's been this mysterious invasion by this very advanced outside party, and we don't really know who they are, and they've put up these giant 300-foot walls.
It's kind of a family espionage thriller, but with some science fiction elements.
What would you do, put in this situation?
What would you do for your children?
What would you do for humanity?
Who come-who comes first?
Colony is the brainchild of creators and executive producers,
Carlton Cuse and Ryan Condal.
Ryan and Carlton are this kind of amazing dynamic duo.
Carlton and I are both huge syfy fans, but we're also big fans of history.
And one of the things that we both were fascinated by was Paris, during Nazi occupation.
We looked at a bunch of photos, and you would see these Parisians, well-dressed, sitting in sidewalk cafes, sipping espressos, while Nazi stormtroopers were going by in the street.
We thought that was a really interesting and incongruous image, that people were trying so hard to kind of keep the normalcy of their lives under this incredibly repressive regime.
It just fascinated us, and we wondered,
"Well, what would that look like in-in our city, where-where we both live?"
And we talked to Legendary about it.
They loved it.
We set it up with USA.
And then we made the pilot last year.
And now, here we are, making a series.
Legendary makes their first foray into television drama, with Colony, and brings together a stellar cast, led by Josh Holloway of Lost.
Carlton called me, like,
"I have an offer you can't refuse."
And Sarah Wayne Callies of The Walking Dead.
It's a story I believe in.
It's a character that I've never seen before.
The acclaimed cast also includes three-time Emmy winner, Kathy Baker, of Picket Fences,
Peter Jacobson of House,
Amanda Righetti of The Mentalist,
True Detective's Tory Kittles,
Carl Weathers of Rocky fame...
Apollo creed!
...and Paul Guilfoyle of CSI.
We feel like we've really got some great actors on our show.
We were kinda just with the characters.
We're sort of seeing the world through their eyes.
You have this world in which these people, who maybe were neighbors at one time, find themselves at odds with each other.
Let me go!
One of the things about reading the script, it made me think about, how far you'd be willing to go to resist.
It was a pilot that was about family, and about people making really, really difficult choices.
For people to come back, week to week, it all begins and ends with the characters.
Everything has suddenly been heightened, and the choices that you make, who you side with, who you choose to trust, who trusts you, become massively important for your day-to-day survival.
It's a political environment.
Everything you do has a political component.
Throughout human history, we've either occupied someone, or been occupied by someone else.
It's shocking what human beings will do in these situations.
What would you do to survive?
What are the compromises you would make?
What are the things that you would be capable of doing?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You stink.
And you, you stink.
At the center of the show, is the Bowmann family.
Will is a former FBI agent, forced underground by the Occupation.
All the people who were police, and authority figures, military, was wiped out during the arrival, and Will was smart enough to go underground.
He and his wife, Katie, must navigate this new world, where freedom no longer exists, and the consequences for disobedience are deadly.
Get up!
Let's go.
Their relationship is already complicated.
They have true love at the core.
Yet, they've lost a child.
Will and Katie have three kids, but only two of them are living with them right now, 'cause their son, Charlie, was caught on the other side of the wall when these mysterious invaders showed up.
And that's fracturing the family in various ways.
It's bad enough he's gone, but to see you every day hating me for it.
I don't hate you for it.
Will and Katie are desperate to get their kid back.
And so, Will hired this guy to smuggle him into Santa Monica, to rescue Charlie.
You'll be my 38th run.
You got nothin' to worry about.
Hop in.
You have entered the exclusion zone.
Remain inside your vehicle until otherwise directed.
My box kills x-ray and thermal.
They'll never know we were here.
Freeze!
Hands where we can see them!
- Get 'em up!
- Move, now!
- Stay where you are!
- On your knees!
Keep 'em up!
Put your hands behind your head!
Medic!
Get me a medic, now!
Coming up, on Colony-- Behind The Wall...
Find out how the show's creators built the world of occupied Los Angeles utilizing firsthand accounts...
Juan, our director, grew up in Argentina, under a dictatorship.
...state of the art effects technology.
Story always comes first.
The visual effects are a way to augment and help tell that story.
...and good, old-fashioned Hollywood magic.
Hey!
Where is my phone call?
- Let me out!
- I want my phone call.
- Step back!
- I need to call my wife.
Agh!
Occupied Los Angeles is a world very much like our own...
There's blue sky.
There's palm trees.
There's good weather.
...with some eerie differences.
There's an unscalable wall that surrounds the city.
Show creators, production designers, and visual effects specialists combine with cast and crew to bring this incredible world to life.
Colony is this kinda wonderful blend of-of elements that give you a-a really unique look on what life in Los Angeles would be like if we were actually occupied.
This world's just that ten percent different enough to really kind of make you sit back and say, "Whoa.
What-what's happened here?"
The show picks up nearly a year after the arrival.
A cataclysmic invasion that changed everything.
Every defense apparatus was wiped out within eight hours.
All of a sudden,
Los Angeles and its millions of citizens, their lives were completely turned upside down.
Many were killed, many were taken away.
One of the first things that happened after the arrival is, pretty much all the cars went away.
So, this is a very different Los Angeles.
A lot of people are on foot or riding bicycles, so it has this very kind of Parisian feel to the city.
We tried to kinda come up with this idea that beauty and oppression could co-exist.
You know, Los Angeles could look pretty and inviting, but, at the same time, it's clearly now a hostile environment.
What's great about what Carlton and Ryan have done in the concept, is just that idea of isolating it, fencing in groups of people, creates this tension.
Slowly, but surely, you're feeling what it is to be oppressed.
I'm a stickler for the-for the logic of, uh, of the occupation, and of a dictatorship, and how this mentality works.
I grew up in Argentina, uh, during the '70s, where we had a dictatorship.
A very-- a-a pretty rough one, but that a lot of the society was for it.
And I can see that happening very easily in America.
Was an explosion at the Santa Monica gateway, yesterday.
It was the Resistance.
- Those terrorists wounded at least ten people.
- Thank you.
Who knows how many more they killed?
We were going for a look that had a much more documentary style.
We really wanted to make it look and feel very real.
That this could really be happening.
It's very handheld, and, you know, many times, we-we staged the scene, without any specific instructions to the camera operators.
And then we just put, you know, the three cameras, as if they were a news team that are covering the scene for the first time.
Uh, so it feels very immediate, very real.
The production designer is in charge of the look of the TV show.
I'm responsible for all of the things in front of the camera.
From building the sets to decorating the sets.
The sets are beautiful, which, right away, for an actor, that puts you in a good place.
So, The Yonk is my bar.
This bar.
The Yonk is short for Yoknapatawpha, which took me some time to learn how to say.
- Thank you, Ryan.
- I love The Yonk.
It's kind of a bar that has a Southern vibe to it.
It definitely feels real.
Oh, well, look who made it after all!
Oh, you think I'd miss the opportunity to drink publicly for the first time in 11 months?
As a designer, I was kind of excited about all of the kinda graphic qualities to it.
Resistance posters, and posters that are more like pro-Occupation.
By the visuals of what we put on the screen, we're telling the audience where you are.
The visual effects are a huge part, uh, of this show.
We have this tremendous visual effects partner, in Ghost, who is our, uh, visual effects studio, out of, uh, Copenhagen, in Denmark.
They visualized an amazing pilot.
Our walls, the 300-foot walls that surround Los Angeles, are an entirely digital creation, as are the drones that patrol the skies.
Yeah, the drones are-- th-they are little characters of their own right.
Th-they are, essentially, acting.
They're in patrol mode, in seek and destroy mode.
In modes that we don't know what they're really thinking.
Even though they're mechanical, and they're just whizzing around, you'll actually see, they have different personalities.
Ryan geeks out on all the science fiction stuff.
Like, he was showing me pictures of drones, and we were jumping up and down like children.
You know, it was like, yes!
I've always wanted to be in Battlestar Galactica, and, like, Star Wars, and all these amazing shows, and we get to do stuff like that.
The most difficult thing for actors is trying to imagine elements such as drones that they've never even seen.
And my role is to assist them to imagine this world.
We need to make sure that eye lines are correct, and they are actually looking at a drone that is somewhere that we're not seeing in real life.
So, it's especially challenging on a blue screen, or a green screen as well.
The toughest thing is, really, it's the cars.
Los Angeles is a very busy city.
Well known for, uh, its greatest export,
- which is traffic.
- To clean up these roads, and to make it look like we're in a no-car environment, is really, really difficult.
So, we lock down lanes of traffic as much as possible.
We pick off little pieces from our plate shots that don't have traffic in them, and it's a really painful process of painting them out.
- Fire in the hole!
- Action!
Today is probably the-- one of the biggest shots.
We're gonna have bullet hits.
Uh, alien drones whizzing in from the background.
Next week, we're, uh, blowing up an entire house.
Each week, we get more and more exciting effects.
Coming up, on Colony-- Behind The Wall, we'll explore occupied Los Angeles, and discover the challenges faced by its citizens.
If you're resourceful and clever, you can survive this occupation.
Both the Collaborators...
There's no victory to be had against these people.
What there is, is compromise.
...and the Resistance.
There's a lot of fear and consternation goin' on.
That's a good word, "consternation."
Consternation in-in the colony.
I like it.
As you dig deeper into Colony, you'll discover the oppressive new world under which the citizens of Los Angeles are forced to live.
There's no communication.
There's no internet.
There's no cell phone service.
There's no information that goes outside of these walls.
I'm lookin' for Will Bowmann.
Are you Will Bowmann?
Sullivan.
Ahh!
Not anymore.
Los Angeles is now under martial law.
A giant wall separates the city into three blocks, each administered by a proxy government.
There's Santa Monica, there's the Los Angeles block, and there's the San Fernando Valley block.
- Where are you taking me?
- Green Zone.
In the LA block, where our characters live, you either live in the flats or you live in the Green Zone.
The Green Zone is the more privileged area, where the people that collaborate with the transitional authority live.
The Hollywood Hills and Bel Air, all those houses have been taken over and are occupied by the new elite.
They're leading very nice, luxurious lives, whereas the regular citizens are not.
They're subject to rations and repression.
The show sort of explores that dichotomy.
I'm the Proxy Governor of our little block here.
Why am I here?
To turn crisis into opportunity.
I take question with the fact that he's a bad guy.
He collaborates with a clean conscience because I think that Snyder believes truly that he is a force for good change.
Wait-wait-wait.
Hold on.
You can't-- Ahh!
After the arrival, the Occupation government established their own police force, which the citizens refer to as The Red House.
They run ads, just like army ads. They're tryin' to recruit people to control other people.
There's a military curfew in effect every night.
The things that you used to take for granted, like walking down the street to go get a cup of coffee, are not so easy anymore.
You don't know, at any given moment, whether you might get hauled out of your house and taken away, never to be seen again.
My brother got sent up.
The Factory.
What is The Factory they keep talking about?
Is it a concentration camp?
Nobody really knows what The Factory is, or what it's making, but what we do know is, is that people who go to The Factory don't ever come back.
In opposition to this new totalitarian regime, stands the Resistance.
A shadowy group of fighters led by the mysterious Geronimo.
The Resistance wants very much to end this occupation.
These are just everyday men and women whose lives have been turned upside down.
People are willing to risk their lives to make change.
- A revolution.
- Down!
How big is the Resistance?
Who runs it?
What's their grand plan?
How organized are they?
Those are all mysteries that are a part of the show.
Our hosts are tired of the insurgency.
You want me to collaborate.
Infiltrate the insurgency and bring us their leader.
Does he agree with resisting?
Yes, but they're going about it in the wrong way.
They're getting innocent people killed.
Amidst these warring factions,
Will and Katie struggle to keep their family safe.
They try to live their life the way they had before it was ripped out from under them.
Family in a world like this takes on a new primacy.
Madeline's living with them, her sister.
And Hudson, Madeline's son.
For Maddie, finding insulin for her son is-is one of the biggest challenges.
Certain conditions are deemed unworthy for treatment.
Diabetes is one of 'em.
This has to be kept cold.
It's way too hot in here.
What do you think you're doin'?
- I'm not buying insulin.
- A trade is a trade!
Whether it's trying to buy something on the black market, or whether it's being out at the wrong place after the curfew sirens sound, the world is full of all these perils that never existed before,
and our characters are trying to navigate their way through this and survive.
If you can't help me, then you and your wife, and your children, you'll all be sent to The Factory.
The most important day in human history is coming.
I just want you and your family to be on the right side of it.
The audience will learn more about who these mysterious invaders are, what they want, what they're up to, what their powers are.
There are all these sort of layers to the show that will be explored over time.
Coming up, find out how the cast answers the question, collaborate or resist?
I don't know if I would have the courage to risk my children.
And the creators give us a special sneak peek of a scene from the premiere episode.
- Don't tell him.
- Yeah.
Don't- - Just because he asked nicely doesn't mean
- you're gonna tell.
- Keep watching.
Cameras and marker.
Actor number two, action!
Colony, USA Network's new original series, is a high-stakes drama about surviving in a new world.
It's an old human story, but this is unlike any enemy we've faced before.
These characters, they come up against all sorts of dilemmas about, what are some of the compromises that we need to make in order to survive?
Who are you, deep down?
What kind of character do you have?
And what would you do for your family?
The characters in Colony must walk the fine line between Collaboration and Resistance.
Nothing and no one is what they seem.
You don't know who to trust.
We lie to everyone.
We lie to protect ourselves.
Why are they collaborating?
What is at stake for them?
And that is the beauty of this show.
It's a character-driven study of perspectives.
And now, here's an exclusive sneak peek at a scene from Colony.
Please, no!
No!
Get off me!
Get off!
USA Network, Legendary Television, and creators and executive producers,
Carlton Cuse and Ryan Condal, have created the next great television drama.
All great stories are, at their core, human stories.
We get to take a fantastic universe and use it to examine the contemporary issues of our own world.
It's about humans battling humans.
It's about the things we're capable of doing to each other.
It focuses on that unbreakable family bond.
Big, heavy, moral decisions.
Revolution.
We're not telling you who's right and who's wrong.
There's no black and white hats.
There are red hats.
Kind of end up with this bit of a Casablanca story.
It's this crossroads of the world, where different people from all walks,
Occupation, and Resistance.
And then the people that are just caught in between, trying to survive.
Hopefully, it'll put yourself in the shoes of our characters and our show, and you'll wanna ask the fundamental questions.
Like, would I collaborate?
Would I be in the Resistance?
What lies outside the LA block?
Is the world destroyed?
It's all a mystery, and that's the fun of the show.
These are things we'll have to discover.
All of this, it's temporary.
Once they've satisfied their needs, they'll leave.
What needs?
Colony premieres Thursday, January 14th, at 10/9 Central, only on USA.
The time has come to make your choice.
Do you collaborate or resist?
That's a heavy question.
It's easy for anybody to sit and say,
"I'd do this" or "I'd do that."
- I resist. - I might collaborate, if I got to make television shows.
I would like to think that I would resist.
I would really take my time to make that decision.
I may be a huge coward.
I have no idea.
When ya can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Collaborate and die.
I would do whatever it took to save my family.
Anything.
Finding a job where you get to work side by side with your friends can be the best.
It can also be the worst.
I came in with two friends!
Thank you!
My name is Cooper Barrett.
My friends and I are here to mess up our lives so you don't have to.
_
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- To our success.
- Mm.
Ah.
- Hey.
- Hey, how'd you know I was here?
What are you talking about?
You're always here.
What's the occasion?
Oh, uh, their hangover cure was just named "Best New Specialty Beverage"
Because of us, everyone from your casual Chardonnay sipper to your hardened alcoholic is waking up to a better American morning.
This is how Dr. Penicillin must have felt when he created the what-cha-ma-call-it.
There are so many things wrong with that statement.
- Who are you looking for?
- I was hoping my girl Kelly would be here so we could hang out, 'cause, you know, we have a thing.
Oh, like a Patty from college thing?
No, there can never be another Patty.
That thing was like a powder keg.
Kelly and I are just, you know, we're besties.
- Hi.
- Who's that?
I would like to introduce you all to my new girlfriend, Ramona.
Howdy, y'all. Nice to meet you.
Let me guess.
Texas?
No, but Kelly bet me ten bucks
I couldn't do the accent.
She can.
I'm actually from London.
- Oh, really?
- Nope.
Orange County.
You owe me another ten.
Oh, God, you're so good at accents!
What the hell is going on?
Nice to meet you. I'm, uh, Cooper Barrett.
Ramona.
- Cooper?
- Yeah.
- Can I talk with you for a sec?
- Sure. Sorry.
- Knock it off.
- What did I do?
You just used your "I want to sleep with you" voice.
"Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett."
I sound like Optimus Prime?
You are not to sleep with her.
What?
'Cause of... 'cause of this.
This?
There's no this.
- So I can sleep with her.
- No!
Listen.
Solid girlfriends do not come easy to me, and I don't want you and your penis messing it up.
Okay, first of all, she hasn't even expressed any interest.
And second, if she did, and I went through with it, I hope you know I respect you enough to never tell you about it.
Fine, I won't sleep with her. Thank you.
Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett.
Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett.
Hi. I'm Cooper Barrett.
- Hi.
- There it is.
_
Pretty great, right?
Can't buy publicity like that. Free sample.
Oh, thanks. This makes it seem like you run the company by yourself. Yeah, you don't even mention us one time in this whole thing.
"Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure," not Cooper's.
Your grandma hasn't been hungover a day in her life!
Come on, guys, let's focus on the big picture, all right?
That company, HangEnder, won this award three years in a row, and we just beat them. It's not about individual credit. Plus, I would have sung your praises
- if I was given the opportunity.
- "When asked how he was able
"to accomplish so much, he credited the inspiration of Steve Jobs and a good night's sleep."
Yeah, you're right. That was my window, I blew it.
- I'm sorry. I...
- "And later, he wished to thank
"his two best friends: hard work
- and determination."
- Oh, guys, I messed up.
But it was a phone interview. I mean, you guys know I value you and your ideas.
Yeah, hold that thought.
Get your free sample.
Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure?
- I've heard that stuff's made in an apartment, and you can taste pig feces.
What?
Where'd you hear that?
"Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure is made in an apartment with pig feces."
That's simply untrue.
I mean, he hasn't had an accident in weeks.
I mean, if they would have said pig urine...
There's comments from this CooperSucks person all over the net.
Obviously, the person who's posting this has inside information, so they can do serious damage to our business, if they haven't already.
Okay, so how do we find out who this CooperSucks69 is?
I'm one step ahead of you, sir.
I've traced the IP address, and it looks like it's someone... in our apartment building.
- What do you want?
- Hey, Virgil.
Uh... someone's been trolling Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure online.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
What is... trolling?
Uh, it means people are making fun of us on the Internet.
Ooh. Which site do I do that?
We're not telling you to do that.
Oh, I'll find out.
I have so many "Barry's Grandma's so fat" jokes.
What?
!
Do you really think Mrs. Billingsly is our troll?
She's, like, 90 years old.
Well, we have to cross everyone in the building off our list.
You know what?
I haven't seen her in a few weeks. Come to think of it, neither have I.
Well, at least she led a good life.
Actually, I think she collaborated in the Armenian genocide. But still, neat lady.
I don't get it. We've checked every apartment.
Well, not every apartment.
I can't believe it.
I never would've suspected it.
What are you guys doing in my apartment?
Welcome home...
Kelly.
Or should we say, CooperSucks69?
Wait.
Were the first 68 CooperSucks already taken?
This is impossible.
Had anyone else in your apartment recently?
- Any male visitors, perhaps?
- Or poltergeists?
I seen this episode of Ghost Hunters where this one ghost went into this one dude's account and messed up his credit. Spooky.
No guys or ghosts have been in my apartment.
I'm the only one who uses this computer.
Oh, and Ramona.
Wait, wait, wait, hold up. Say Ramona's last name is Miller.
- Right?
- You're already forgetting her name.
You slept with her, didn't you? !
- You said she was a trainer?
- Yeah. So?
Because Ramona Miller is not a personal trainer.
She is the President and CEO of HangEnder, our main competitor.
What?
She clearly saw us as a threat, posed to be your friend, just to get info about us to try to take us down!
To think, I almost slept with her.
Come to think of it, she was asking a lot of questions about your company.
Why the hell you tell her about our pig feces?
Why are you living in an apartment with pig feces?
It's stinking up the entire building.
I think that smell was Mrs. Billingsly.
What happened to Mrs. Billingsly?
Honey,
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God!
I lose two of my best girlfriends in one day? I'm gonna punch Ramona in her lying, flawless face!
Best plan is to get even.
I have an idea how to do that.
So do I, so what we do is...
We all listen to Neal because I value his ideas.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Thanks, Coop.
Okay, Kelly, first, you're gonna take Ramona out to brunch.
But don't let on that you know who she really is.
Sorry. You're doing great.
Just pretend like it's a normal brunch. And then I punch her in the face.
No. You make witty conversation.
So, tell me about all that personal training
- that you definitely do for a living.
- Oh, you know,
- lots of burpees, that sort of thing.
- Oh.
Will you excuse me?
I have to go to the bathroom really quick.
And then when she's not paying attention, you take her computer and pass it off to Barry in disguise.
- Fake mustache and tuxedo?
- No!
Cooper, be supportive. Yes, Barry, like that, but, you know, something better.
Got it.
Barry, you'll go to the kitchen where you'll find me and Cooper waiting.
- What is he doing here?
- I'm meeting Leslie next door for lunch. I heard you guys were hiding in the kitchen.
- By the way, it's me, Barry.
- I know.
- You look like Neil deGrasse Tyson.
- Interesting.
- Just like the Milky Way.
- Come on, Neal.
Hurry up! Got to get it before she gets back from the restroom.
She should really update this thing.
- I mean, OS 7? Total noob.
- Neal!
Got the data. All right. Out.
All we have to do is return it before Ramona gets back.
Unless Josh's wife comes by, notices Kelly, and ruins the entire plan.
Welcome to my life.
- Kelly!
- Leslie!
I thought I saw you.
Hey.
You know what? I'm glad I'm running into you, because I feel like we need to reconnect.
Why is...? What-what is she doing here?
Leslie, you remember Ramona, right?
Hi.
You didn't answer my question.
Please go do something.
I mean, I'm...
I'm gonna meet my husband. We're gonna go have brunch
- next door.
- Go.
Socially, you know,
- I'm pretty covered.
- Hey, babe!
- Oh.
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
I was just walking by, saw you ladies chatting it up.
Uh, look at that. Shoelace is untied.
- Dangerous. There it is.
- Yeah.
So you guys, like, hang out all the time?
Nope, wasn't untied.
It was actually tied the whole time.
- Thank God. - We should go. We got a res.
- Right, yeah.
- Bouncedy-bounce.
Yeah, okay, bye.
Just so you know, 37 followers on Instagram, so, you know, super popular.
- She doesn't care.
- Okay.
And once we successfully
- put it back in Ramona's bag...
- Bye!
...go through her data, cancel her orders, and later, Cooper will call to contact her clients.
Well, I am sorry to hear that they canceled, but we have a vehicle in your area which can get our product to you within the hour.
All right, thanks so much.
Bye-bye.
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm. Can you believe it? Your plan worked.
Yeah, Cooper, I can believe it.
Can you believe that our nearest star, Alpha Centauri, is only four light years away?
Can I just say, I am really enjoying your Neil deGrasse Tyson.
It is fun and informative.
You know what else is fun?
The Milky Way.
No, you already used that one.
Pluto is one-third water. There he is!
This fancy hotel looks a lot like a biker bar.
It's like an episode of Sons of Anarchy that doesn't end well.
I'm pretty sure there is no episodes of Sons of Anarchy
- I'm telling you, this is the address listed on Ramona's work order.
This is Cooper.
Hey, Cooper.
This is Ramona Miller.
- I'm actually...
- The President and CEO
- of HangEnder. I know exactly who...
- Who I am?
I know that you know, but here's something you don't know.
That order you took from me was a fake.
- What order?
- Moron, give it up. I've been one step ahead of you this whole time.
You may be easy on the eyes, but that doesn't mean that you know how to run a business.
First rule is, don't ever work with your friends.
Second rule is shut up.
You're obviously flailing here. Let me put you out of your misery and buy your company from you.
You didn't listen to the second rule.
Hmm.
We've been set up.
Let's get out of here before we get ourselves killed.
Yep.
That was a close one.
Okay. Hi. There's so many of you.
Okay.
- Hi, guys. Hi.
- Uh, okay.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?
They gonna kill us anyway.
- He's not with us!
- Sorry!
My mustache fell off when they threw me through that window.
Mercury has...
Damn!
All my space facts are gone, Neal!
Okay.
Tell me everything.
Did you rub it in Ramona's face yet?
Uh, things didn't exactly work out.
Ramona tricked us into going to a biker bar, and...
Come on, Cooper.
Tell everybody what you're really thinking.
What am I really thinking?
"Uh, the reason I don't listen to your ideas, Neal, is "because the one time that I do, we get outsmarted by a rival "and thrown through a window.
"Maybe, Neal, instead of complaining "that you don't get enough credit, you should acknowledge
"that I'm the brains of the operation. Just sit your nerdy face down in front of a computer!"
- Easy, Cooper.
- "And you, you big bastard, get your ass back in the kitchen and handle the product!"
You know what, Cooper, you've gone too far!
I'm out!
- I hope you're happy.
- I didn't even say anything.
Okay, I don't even know who's yelling at who here, but we need to focus on Ramona.
So there's no truth to what I said?
- Well, it was your plan. But...
- Oh, my God.
Some words you can't take back, Cooper!
You have to go after Neal.
Don't you see?
Dividing you guys like this, this is exactly Ramona's plan.
Okay.
I think you're giving her a little too much credit.
- Hey, Neal.
- Oh, my God.
I heard you're unhappy with Cooper.
Mm. Yeah, it's not going well.
You should've heard the things he said to me.
You know that I think you're incredibly impressive and that I value what you do.
Thank you.
What is it that I do?
The viral marketing.
Your Web site. The entire database you set up was brilliant.
Your idea for Pajama Tuesdays.
Full disclosure, I just didn't feel like wearing clothes that day.
We could really use your skills at HangEnder. And... this would be your starting salary.
I'm sorry, is this some sort of joke?
I mean, Cooper and I are best friends.
I'm not gonna let one little petty f...
This is HangEnder.
- You've reached Neal Fissley's office.
- Oh, Louise?
Can you confirm my massage will be on a table and not one of those airport chairs?
And, uh, I'm out of lollipops, so... thank you.
I can't let her get away with taking Neal.
I'll help you get her back, but it could get ugly.
She pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
She puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of hers in the morgue.
Oh, I've been dying to use that line from The Untouchables since '87. May not have been worth it.
It's not about revenge, okay? It's about business.
And if I want to succeed, I got to beat Ramona at her own game.
Well, what are you prepared to do, Cooper?
- That's not helpful. - Welcome to the Rock.
- Hello, Ramona.
- Hey, Cooper.
If you're looking for a job, I'm afraid Neal's
- already hired an assistant.
- That's not why I'm here.
Oh, good, because the girl who got the job
- is way more qualified than you.
- If you're done,
I have a little proposal for you:
you give me Neal back, and I'll forgive the attack on my company and I promise
Counterproposal:
I keep Neal, bankrupt your company, and you come back to my place and we get rid of the sexual tension between us.
Interesting idea.
Let me consider/fantasize about that for a second.
Not gonna lie, that was amazing. But I still have to reject your offer.
That's too bad.
I have lots of mirrors, and I had a terrible childhood.
Listen, Ramona, you have no idea what you're up against.
I think I have a pretty good idea.
You may have Neal, but I have a better product.
And I still have Barry Sandel.
Hi, Barry.
I wanted to discuss... Look, I know why you're here and I'm not interested.
But if you could just hear me out for one second, I think...
It's my grandmother's sweat and tears in this cure, okay?
Literally. That's the two main ingredients.
Look, I know Cooper likes to hog all the credit and he called me a big bastard, but at the end of the day, we are still friends.
Our break room has a milkshake machine.
This is HangEnder. Barry Sandel's office. HangEnder rules!
Totally.
Louise!
Why am I seeing the bottom of my lollipop jar?
- Thank you. - All right, Josh, let's get ugly.
Coyote ugly.
It was on after The Untouchables.
Weird double feature.
Starz is the best.
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.
It's not gonna work.
- We should've gone with my plan.
- Oh, yeah. Three stink bombs and a "Ramona Sucks!" banner.
You know what, we'll do that right after we TP her house and leave a bag of poo on the front step.
I love that. One tweak: fire.
What's going on?
Just whipping up tons of the cure for Bev Con.
It's a beverage conference.
We already have a better product and if we can outsell Ramona at Bev Con, her company will be destroyed and our company's rise will be documented in the next little-seen Aaron Sorkin film.
"Our company"?
You're the only one left in your company. Okay, I don't need those guys. I was doing everything anyway.
I can't read Barry's writing. Does this say "cinnamon" or "cyanide"?
You should probably just assume cinnamon.
Oh, oh, oh. Check it out.
♪ Dun, dun, dun ♪
- Jelly beans.
- Oh.
What's in this one?
Gummy worms!
Josh, can we just focus?
I need you to... chop up 400 onions and then, uh, throw half of them away.
- What?
- It's Barry's process, so...
Cooper, the reason you got into this company is so you could build something great with your friends.
Maybe you should go and apologize.
It's too late.
They made their choice.
I came here because Cooper is too stubborn...
What?
!
I came here because Cooper is too stubborn to tell you how much he needs you guys.
And you need him.
I don't need anything except for my milkshakes delivered freezing cold!
I'm talking 32 degrees Fahrenheit, Scottie, okay?
That's Fahrenheit!
- Son of a bitch.
- Guys,
Ramona doesn't value your ideas.
She just brought you here to undermine Cooper.
I went and looked at your offices... you don't even have computers!
Yeah, 'cause our assistants take dictation... of our lunch orders and our dreams and cool inventions that we have.
Hey, Kelly.
Nice to see you.
Oh...
That's the spirit.
Ramona, Kelly seems to you think that we're just pawns and that you actually don't value our ideas. That's ridiculous.
Okay, name one of them.
Um...
Like the commercial we did about the girls in bikinis talking to girls in bikinis. Bikini-bikini.
No. That's terrible.
- I worked two days on that.
- That was cream of the crop.
Okay, fine, you're pawns.
But you're well-paid pawns with offices and assistants.
Kelly.
Due to recent events, this milkshake has become less delicious.
It's still a free milkshake.
That's true.
- You guys are worse than Cooper.
- What?
!
And he's the worst.
- Huh?
!
- Huh?
!
Cures your hangover.
Yes, HangEnder ends the hang in the hangover, in the hangover.
- HangEnder!
HangEnder!
- Hey, guys.
You're doing great.
Just stay in Cooper's eyeline and remember...
Don't talk to anybody.
Don't touch anything.
Perfect.
Barry's Grandma's Hangover Cure is made from an age-old recipe.
Comes straight from a real grandmother who used to get hungover quite a bit, so...
Okay, just, uh...
So how many cases do you guys want?
Uh...
Guys, I'm really going to need you to step it up.
We're working for free. And I'm drunk from the hard lemonade booth.
Would you like brochures?
You were right.
I'll be right back.
Hey, guys. Just, uh, wanted to say that I should've given you guys more credit for everything you did for the company and I'm really glad you guys landed somewhere great.
Cooper, we're kind of busy right now.
Okay, understood.
Just...
just as long as we...
Call Scottie and set up an appointment.
Okay.
Everyone.
Welcome, everyone.
As you all know, hangover cures are becoming a billion dollar industry, and we've got the best one in the business.
My wonderful team has worked tirelessly to bring you this incredible video that will introduce you to our brand. A video?
Oh, come on.
HangEnder was founded by President and CEO Ramona Miller in 2011 after a bachelorette party gone wrong in Las Vegas.
Oh, yeah, they're happy.
- She looks good.
- HangEnder is made from only the freshest and natural ingredients.
Fresh berries, figs, pubic hair, filth from humans and pig's poop.
What?
Wait.
What's going on?
Ew!
Ramona Miller does not care about black people.
No!
I love black people.
What?
Oh, that's not okay.
Turn it off. Turn it off! And...
Hangover Cures for life.
Move out of the way!
Get out of here.
- It's the best.
- That's right.
Who came up with that?
What are you talking about?
We did.
Of course you did.
- That was a great idea, man.
- That was amazing.
All right, let's get back to work. Let's get back to work.
- All right.
Let's go.
- Yay!
- Oh, hi. Come on, come on, come on. - Gather round, gather round.
This has no pubic hair in it.
No poo.
Hey, guys.
I just wanted you to meet my new best girlfriend, Renee.
My name is Shawna.
We have tons in common and we're pretty much inseparable besties.
Uh, you must be Josh.
No. No that one. Kelly.
Did you meet Renee?
Look at her.
You're so lucky.
Ramona turned out to be, like, a ruthless shark, but she got hers.
So you and Ramona aren't friends anymore?
You're free to hang out?
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh, cool.
Renee, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
It's Shawna.
Why are you still here?
Girls can be so clingy.
So, working with friends... It can be hard but it can be done.
All you have to do is admit when you're wrong and more importantly than anything, admit when they're right. And don't let your pig bathe in your hangover cure. And maybe don't own a pig.
Ramona.
Are you, uh, here to apply for the bartender position?
No, I came to congratulate you guys on Bev Con and to ask how you'd feel about joining forces.
- Absolutely not.
- What?
- She's crazy.
- Welcome to the Rock.
The bottom line is you guys have the better product but you don't have the resources to get it out there.
I do and I think together we'd be unstoppable.
What do you say?
I don't know.
I have to ask my partners.
So don't be afraid to team up with the people you love the most, because when it comes to work, it's always wise to keep your friends close...
Let's do it.
Good call. ...and your enemies closer.
Episode 1 War of Empire Japan, during the Yongsama syndrome, went crazy for the Korean entertainment industry. And its effect on the Korean economy was 1.196 trillion won. (about US$1 billion)
The effect on Korean economy that Lee Young Ae, a top star in 60 countries, made is 3 trillion won. (a little less than 3 billion dollars) Ms. Lee Young Ae, even if she's now married with kids, she's still beautiful, of course. They may imagine "what if Bae Yong Joon, who is still single, was my man"
but the women are not going crazy because of his fine six-pack. The central reason is Hallyu - because Korean Dramas exist, he is receiving love. As per one book which is written by one expert of the Korean broadcasting system, even if young people in Vietnam don't know the name of their Chief Secretary of the Communist party, it's said that there is nothing they don't know about Hallyu star Jang Dong Geon.
Through Hallyu, the yearly export surplus on general merchandise is 27 trillion won.
This includes, of course, exported DVDs of our dramas and OST music, the local handphones which appear in dramas, the cosmetics in dramas, even up to the cars they drive in the dramas.
Money. Everything is turned into money.
Theddukbokkiwe ordinarilyeat onthestreet isenjoyedlikeafirstrateItalianpastawhichisordered to eat.
At the moment they put the ddukbokki, a top star ate in a drama, into their mouths:
(In Japanese) It's delicious!
(In Japanese) It's awesome, isn't it?
They have fallen for Korea now.
I can't be in love with you (french)
Look at this!
I've never seen something like that.
They are in love with our Korean TV dramas.
(In Japanese) You're in the way!
Even Japan, the country which gave the degradation of colonization for 36 years.
The country that considers the land of Koguryeo as their land - China.
The country of Ghenghis Khan, who succeeded in winning the largest territory in world history - Mongolia.
(In Mongolian) Got it!
Dramas of no other country but Korea!
They are crazy about our dramas.
Cut scene!
Did you just spit on me?
!
Sorry, sorry.
Director, I can't work like this.
To catch just one percent in the viewer ratings...
Just a bit.
Our dramas, which the whole world is watching.
Money!
Anthony Kim Empire Production Representative
Because they turn into money.
M-O-N-E-Y.
Money.
To make a drama that turns into money we need to use a writer who makes money.
Of course we have to use actors who make money. Right now, "Elegant Revenge", produced by our Empire Production Company, including its writer Jeong Hong Joo, the money that was paid for the script for the last 7 years in my company?
The cost for the castings is only 86 billions, 950 millions and 41 won.
With rounding it up, it's 87 billion won (US$87 million). And out of a total of 29 dramas that were aired I made 27 a success.
I'm moving within the accurate probability.
And that probability is exactly made by my hand.
Everyone, can you tell me what a drama is?
A drama is a war with numbers.
Over there!
Representative, you said that out of your total 29 dramas, 27 succeeded.
Then, what is the reason why the other two dramas failed?
That means that the dramas you will make in the future can possibly fail too.
Ah, of course, you're right.
The thing that made those two dramas fail... Unless, in 2002, the World Cup which made all people in Korea go crazy with red devil fever and mad-cow disease beef controversy of May, in 2008, happens again!
I'll absolutely never fail.
Therefore people call the ring I'm wearing "Lord of the Rings,"
and they call me the "King of Dramas." Everybody, the third-class people change the world, and the first-class... enjoys that world.
Representative, what is the secret of your success?
Representative!
You've already extended the term of the loan for 10 million won (US$10,000) four times.
Yes.
Your address is still the same, right?
You're a drama writer?
Yes.
Lee Go Eun "Elegant Revenge," a secondary writer.
I really like dramas.
What have you written?
Elegant Revenge.
Elegant Revenge?
!
Wow! It's the last day, today!
I'm a huge fan!
I had no idea such a young person was the writer of that drama.
I'm... just a secondary writer.
By secondary writer, you run errands... Well, I also run errands, but the real work I do... Anyway, I think you wrote your job incorrectly.
Huh?
Strictly speaking, you're not a writer.
No, but being a secondary writer is a tough job.
Anyway, fix it.
This is wrong, too.
You have to write "jobless".
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
A secondary writer is also a job. For 365 days per year, sleeping bit by bit, doing all little chores like cleaning and laundry, we're also writing each word to get paid!
Therefore, I'm not jobless!
What?
I've paid that dirty expensive interest without missing even once, and made your bank gain profit!
I got the loan from the bank, not from you, Ajumma! I don't have much time now, so before pulling out my dirty temper, process this one. QUICKLY!
Except for the last 10 minutes of this final episode, we've sent all the rest of the tapes to be edited.
Managing Director Oh Jin Wan Empire Production's #2 person The shooting team is now standing by at Samcheok, Gangwondo.
And 10 hours...
There are only ten hours left until the broadcast!
Writer Jeong said she can't write.
Can't write?
She said she can't write about that orange juice as PPL (product placement advertisement), so the script for the last part isn't done yet.
So, how much percent?
Pardon?
So how much percent of the probability to miss the broadcasting time?
Well, I'm not so good at math...
I majored in Literature, so...
There's not enough time.
Jeong Hong Joo Elegant Revenge's main writer, a career 20-yr veteran.
[Mad dog in Cheongdamdong] Yes, Writer Jeong, You're working hard even in this situation that the time is exactly money.
Working hard?
Well..
I'm writing this, not even eating a proper meal!
That's why I sent 10 packs of fresh, exceptional orange juice.
Haven't you tasted it yet?
Representative Kim... It's a classy and suitable juice for you, a writer getting paid 20 million won per episode.
This is the scene that our main character will die elegantly after finishing his revenge.
So does it make sense for him to drink orange juice there?
Writer, you know the hitter with a legendary rate, Yang Joon Hyeok of the Samsung Lions.
When there was a rumor about trading him to another team, he said;
"In my body, blue blood is running!" (Samsung Lions uniform's color)
This is a sentence of faith for him to keep his loyalty to the team.
Writer Jeong, right now, in my body, yellow blood is running. (without honorifics)
Is it so difficult to make the main character drink orange juice?
What?
!
Did you just talk down to me?
Would I only talk down to you? I can kick you out too, Writer Jeong!
How dare you kick me out?
Hey!
I'm...
I'm Jeong Hong Joo!
Dramas may be art to you for all I know, but to me they are business.
And with that one pack of orange juice, 300 million won is on the line. If you're not going to give up my precious 800 million won, which you've been paid so far for the script, then right now, add orange juice into the script!
What if I don't?
This isn't a request.
This is the order from the owner who hired you.
Orange?
Orange juice my ass!
I'm back!
You, seriously... !
Go Eun, does this make sense?
Huh?
The main character who is about to have a heroic death dies after drinking the orange juice of PPL(product placement advertisement)? Does it make sense?
What kind of crazy guy would do this?
-Who else...
The Cheongdamdong Crazy Dog.
Elegant Revenge Final Episode, the end.
Go Eun...
Correct any typos and send it to them.
Yes.
Oh, Teacher...
What did you do with that orange juice?
Go Eun...
The real artist should not compromise for a dirty shoppy businessman.
You've worked really hard, too.
Then, I'm leaving now.
Teacher!
Even so, what should I say if the production company calls?
Tell him that I'm gone under the water.
(implying "disconnect all contact lines")
I'm leaving.
Okay... go carefully.
Oh!
Representative, the ending has just arrived.
The phone you called is not available now... Representative, it's already 1:30PM.
Why don't you just tell them to feed that orange juice to the actors and shoot the final scene?
Where did that orange juice come from?
Huh?
Before the main character dies, where did he get it from so that he drinks it?
Ah, well... that...
But, about that... It was exposed 7 times, and one of them should be at least 10 seconds. For that, we got 300 million won ($300,000).
From the location to the description, dialogue, entire scene needs to be corrected.
But... now we have only 8 and half hours until the on-air time.
If Writer Jeong says she can't write it, what else can we do?
Yes, Chairman.
How did it go?
According to Chief Moon, the ending tape hasn't even arrived yet.
Please don't worry, tonight's show will be aired without any problem.
At this rate, what if the broadcasting accident (going blank) happens?
Chairman...
I am Anthony.
That will never happen.
I worried for nothing.
I forgot for a moment that you are Anthony.
After the show is finished, I will report back to you.
I'll talk to you later.
Representative, what should we do?
What is the secondary writer's name?
Lee Go Eun.
Representative!
That's right, I'm Anthony Kim.
Teacher isn't here.
I already know that.
Representative?
Actually, a moment ago, Writer Jeong had a car accident.
Teacher?
She was on her way back to here, as she promised to correct the script.
But at the intersection right over there, she had a three-car rear-end collison.
Th...
Then is Teacher... okay?
Don't worry, I've checked on her getting rest and falling asleep at ER with my own eyes.
Which hospital is it?
Before Writer Jeong fell asleep, she asked you, Miss Lee Go Eun, to correct the script.
Me?
She said that you're a very competent writer, who is like her other half.
But... what did she say to correct....?
What do you mean, "what"? Of course, it's about the orange juice.
That orange juice... she said I should write that?
Yes, right.
You need to correct that orange juice scene.
There is no way that Teacher told me to do so.
She also said that you would answer like that.
Then, from the location to stage direction and dialogue of the characters...
Up to the scene that the character dies after drinking the orange juice.
You're saying she said that I should correct all of them?
That's why I came here personally, not just called, although I'm so busy now.
Really?
!
Do you... think I'm telling a lie?
N-No.
We don't have much time...
START WRITING!
The time... time's running out.
Writer Jeong said that there is a pretty good one among your practice scripts.
Ah, "Morning of Kyeong Seong"?
That's right!
The touching story with the background of the Japanese occupation era.
Y-Yes.
Writer Jeong told me to see that right away.
Please bring that to the company tomorrow.
If you finish this one well, you can debut with the next show.
I guarantee you.
Let's go!
Debut...
Let's go.
While we're going, you should write the scene and send it to the team.
Here...
Then... now...
That's right.
We're going to the filming location in Samcheok.
Let's go.
Think well, how we can make the story that the main character drinks the orange juice and die.
The issue here is where he gets the orange juice from.
That's right.
Buying the orange juice doesn't make sense, and receiving it from someone else is also... On top of that, you should manage as little change of what we've already filmed as possible.
Then...
Ah!
The construction site!
The last revenge place for the main character is happening in the construction site, scene #68.
Action scene in between the orange juice boxes...
- Orange juice bottles rolling and falling down!
- Picking up the orange juice?
- So then the ending...
- Drink it.
Bang! -Okay, we'll go with that.
Oh, Director Hong! Leave the camera rails as they are, we've just sent you the corrected script for scene #66 and #67.
Ah, you send the script for scene #66 and #67?
The main character's phone scene at the hospital, cut it at the phone booth nearby.
The hospital and cut? Yes. Move, MOVE, QUICKLY!
Orange juice boxes and the distribution center, I'm working on it now.
Once the shooting is done, move from the beach..... and take the road, 520m to the North from where you are.
Road?
I told you the distribution center.
There is one deserted storage unit.
Hurry up to rent that place and set up that place as close to the distribution center as possible and shoot there.
How much time to get there?
Yes, we'll arrive at 7:04PM.
We'll be there in 2 hours and 35 minutes.
Check the script in 3 seconds.
Managing Director Oh, call the broadcasting station and let them send a helicopter.
- A helicopter?
- Yes.
Also arrange a quick service motorbike from the shooting site to the helicopter.
Ah, y-y-yes!
Scene #69 is done!
Send it first by e-mail and move on to the next scene!
Well, hurry up, please!
We don't have much time.
Be careful!
It's the end!
Prepare it quickly!
Yes!
Hey! Isn't the smoke too much, huh?
- The script is here!
- Okay, okay! Okay...
Action!
Cut!
Okay!
Let's move!
Everybody!
We'll move to the next location!
Here is the next script.
What... ?
The final ending?
We still don't have it.
Then what are we supposed to do?
!
What time is it?
Yes, it's... 5.. 5:27PM.
HEY!
MOVE, MOVE, QUICKLY! GO!
Go! HEY, move all the equipment and go!
Representative, the final ending... So, how many minutes for its running time in M Broadcasting?
It's 65 minutes and 20 seconds.
M Broadcasting Engineer Anthony's planted spy.
Just now, Director Jeong went to the control room with the tape.
Alright.
Let's make one more scene.
Huh?
The drama of M Broadcasting (implying "MBC") has 65 minutes and 20 seconds until the ending, and K Broadcasting ("KBS") one is already finished. So, we should make it 1 minutes and 30 seconds longer than M Broadcasting's drama, so that the rating can be over 30%.
Isn't it too fake?
Yesterday's rating was 24%, but how can it be over 30% even if I write one more scene?
The possibility that viewers will change the channel to another drama after watching their favorite drama is usually 52.3%.
Moreover, our drama will have it's final episode today.
The possibility that viewers will watch our drama at the moment of one and half minutes when other dramas are finished?
82.7%.
But... after killing off all characters, there is only one scene left, where the main character will die alone, so what story can I make more...?
So, that's your job anyway. In this situation when we don't even have time to shoot the additional scene, if we have to add one more scene?
Then...
Should we go with flashback scene?
That's correct!
Yes, Representative. Among the scenes we've filmed before, please edit one flashback scene quickly which possibly comes in mind of the main character, right before he dies.
Flashback?
It will be inserted right before the ending scene.
Running time should be about one and half minute.
Yes, I got it!
Representative, look at this.
"main character, walking with a pack of orange juice..." "drinking orange juice," "orange juice"
Okay, let's go with that.
The last script arrived!
Move, move!
The rest, get out!
Good, good, the last scene. Once we're done with this, it's done!
From now on, the war is started.
Read-y-y-y-y!
Action!
The Representative came.
They are doing the final scene.
Cut!
Hey!
Orange juice close-up!
Let's shoot the close-up of the orange juice!
Cut!
Okay!
The end!
Good job.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Good job.
I've filmed it as you told me to do, but from here to Seoul, it takes at least 4 hours.
There are less than 3 hours till the on-air time.
Don't worry, the helicopter will be used.
Excuse me, Representative. I've just got a message, but because of the bad weather in Seoul, the helicopter can't come.
You useless bastard!
What about the quick-service motorbike?
Well, he's over there.
PD Park, wrap it one more time.
Yes.
How much are you earning for a month?
About 2 million won ($2,000).
Why? To S Broadcasting station ("SBS") in Seoul, not in Kangwondo, if you arrive there in an hour, I will give you 10 million won ($10,000). If you're late by 10 minutes, 5 million won, if you're late by 10 more minutes again, 2 million won, after than, not even a penny.
Think you can do it?
Director Park, lend me that motorcycle.
Huh?
Representative?
Ah... yes.
From here to Seoul, 293.8 km. (about 160 miles) The possibility that biker goes in 300km per hour and arrives there alive is 36.2%.
If he and I, two of us go... it's 72.4%.
Representative Kim!
It's dangerous!
You can die!
Anyway, life is 50:50.
I can't ruin my life because of that half. What I'm afraid of more than death, it's failure.
What are you doing?
Yes?
The script is here, here (in your brain), so to edit the scenes, you should come with me!
What?
Even at this moment while you're hesitating, the possibility is getting lower, bit by bit.
Get on...
NOW!
Oh, Director!
The tape... has the tape arrived?
They say it's on its way.
Lee Seong Jo (Elegant Revenge's Present CP) Moon Sang Il (S Broadcasting Station's Drama Director) Until the air-time, now there are only 30 minutes left.
Kim Byeong Seok (S Broadcasting Station's Deputy Drama Director) Nam Woon Hyeong (S Broadcasting Station's CP)
What?
What happened?
I-Is this 911?
The place is... There is an accident at Route #7, Kangreung junction, near the ramp toward Yeongdong Highway.
It's a motorbiker, and the condition is serious.
Are you crazy? If we leave him like that, he will die, he will!
What on earth is a drama to you so that it's more important than a person's life?
So what can I do at this moment? !
In this field, you should throw away everything else for a drama!
Director... he's not picking up the phone.
Hey!
It has already been 33 minutes since the show has started!
You're the CP in charge of this show, but are you out of your mind? Hey, this is not a regular episode, but the final episode! The final one!
Have you ever seen a final episode without it's ending?
!
Well.. that...s... Even if you have to use a satelite, find out where he is now! Director!
The tape has arrived.
Yeah.
Director, they just started the editing.
How many minutes are left until the ending?
Yes, 5 minutes and 20 seconds left.
Will they be able to edit within the time?
They must do even if they all die.
Before this scene, the main character rides a motorbike to go to the distribution center.
They must have filmed it all together at the end.
Let's cut it and paste it.
Director, the rating is continuously rising.
How many more minutes are left?
Yes, 2 minutes and 50 seconds left.
It's done.
43.
44.
Now, we have only 15 seconds.
Hurry, hurry!
Director... the dramas of other broadcasting stations are all done for today.
The time of death... November 5th, 2010.
30.9%!
Director!
We're the highest one!
Hey, you did a good job.
You've worked hard!
Director!
Good, good!
You asked me earlier what on earth a drama is.
This is the drama we make.
Wow.
They say that people make a condolence call when the dog of a Prime Minister dies, but not when that Prime Minister actually dies.
What you say now means... the mother, of the Minister of Culture and Tourism, is a dog?
No ...
I didn't mean that...
Of course not.
All the real dogs are gathered over there.
Mutts which got wind of food smell in the party and came to get the food.
Representative, yesterday's quick-service rider... passed away at the end.
Sorry to hear that.
That damn motorbike!
I'll crush that right away!
Calm down, Sister-in-law.
Let go of me, Brother-in-law!
To earn those few pennies of money, my husband died.
How can I calm down now....?
But what can we do now?
Life goes on anyway.
This shouldn't have happened.... Calm down, Sister-in-law....
How can I live now... ?
Go Eun's mother, please calm down.
Do you think I can calm down now?
We bought a boat to go fishing, not to kill my husband! Let go of me! Let go of me!
Stop.
No need to cry.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
What can I do....?
Please! Please!
Because of the motorbike, I lost my husband.
What shall I do....?
What will I do for my child?
I'm so angry.... Dear Lord of love, for us gathering here for sorrow, despair and darkness to lose the deceased, please lead us with your holy spirit and grace and please let us live on with faith and hope.
In the name of Jesus, Amen.
She must be resting in peace, embraced by Lord.
Thank you, Representative Kim.
Oh, you're here.
Representative Kim, congratulations.
Drama Director of K Broadcasting. Drama Director of M Broadcasting.
You've continued the legend of "Empire" with an unbeaten performance.
Oh, thank you.
This time, because of the rating of your "Elegant Revenge", we've had really hard time.
Your next one will be done with us, right?
I'm sorry.
I was going to visit you next week.
Good, good. Let's have a meal next week, for sure.
With me, what about a round of golf on this Saturday?
Uh, oh, what are you talking about now?
Representative Kim, you should do your next show with us again, okay?
You must be busy, so you can leave.
Yes, then I will take my leave now.
- Such a jerk!
- What a rude bastard!
Right now, he's hot. But some day, he will fall.
When it comes, let's step on him surely.
All the directors are so impatient now.
Yes, they are, so that they can rush to step on me once I misstep.
[Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel]
Please give us more side dishes.
Okay!
Please give us one more grilled mackerel.
Ah, yes.
Ta-da!
Oh, you're here!
Madame Kang!
Hey, what's up with you?
I'm so busy now.
Did you grill mackerel well with saulty flavor?
I earned money with saulty flavor!
Here, one more grilled mackerel, please!
Okay!
Hurry up, go put your bag inside and come out again.
Mom, by the way...
Why?
I have to send a script to the production company tonight, so please let me skip tonight.
Then, will they pay you?
Of course! Once I debut, they will pay me.
Got it!
Go inside and earn money!
Alright.
Hello, this is Writer Jeong Hong Joo.
If you leave a message, I will call you back.
Teacher, this is Go Eun.
I couldn't reach you, so I'm leaving a message again.
Are you still at the hospital?
You're alright, right?
By the way...
Did you see the last episode of "Elegant Revenge"?
I tried hard to modify the script. Thanks to you, I got the chance to debut.
Thank you so much.
Although I should thank you in person... Anyway, please give me a call.
It's cancelled.
To leave a message, please press 1.
To leave a phone number, please press 2.
Teacher, please give me a call.
I'm so worried, and I have something to tell you in person too.
Please give me a call.
Please!
The message is saved.
[Morning of Kyeongseong]
Writer :
Lee Go Eun.
[Funeral Home] Representative, no matter how much I think over and over, I think you'd better not go in there....
Thank you.
By the way... how do you know my brother....?
At the accident site, I was there with him.
Then, the person who reported to 911...?
And...
I'm also the one who requested the last delivery of the deceased.
The last delivery....? The deceased accepted my request to make a delivery within an hour for the distant taking three hours, and the reason he accepted that impossible request was because I offered to pay 10 million won.
That's why the accident happened unintentionally.
Then, you are.... the reason why my husband died...?
You bastard!
What's the reason you came all the way here and say such things?
After killing my brother, how dare you show up here!
?
Please calm down, please!
If it were you, do you think you can calm down now?
Yes, yes, yes.
I thought it's the right thing for me to tell you the exact situation why the deceased passed away.
And this.
What's the use of such money? My husband is dead now, so what's the use of it!
? Even so, don't you think you gave them too much?
It's from your personal account.
Well, I feel sorry for them too, but actually you don't have any legal responsibility.
And he chose it on his own too.
I don't think there is any reason for you to do that much...
Some one died while working for my drama.
And I'm in charge of that drama.
Is there any other reason needed?
Ah...no.
But, are you really alright?
Don't worry. The drama is finished, and starting tomorrow, for another drama,
I will become a bad jerk again.
What can I help you with?
I came for an appointment with Representative Kim.
Your name is...?
I'm Lee Go Eun, a secondary writer for "Elegant Revenge".
He told me to come here once.
Ah, yes...
Ah, yes, I will send you that right away.
Ah, yes, thank you for loving our drama, yes.
So, let's stop there, after you;ve knocked down all of them, I mean.
After finishing them, you will stop the motion, right there!
And (breathing hard) the sweat will run down, and then, cut! This is it! This is the great one!
Miss Lee Go Eun?
Yes.
Representative Kim is out of his office for a moment.
Please wait inside for a moment
Yes.
C.E.O. Anthony Kim
Hello!
What brought you here?
Yes, you told me before.... Oh, you did a good job before.
Yes.
I came here because you told me before to bring my practice script.
Oh, that's right.
I've prepared this one for 3 years.
It's a historical drama with 20 episodes, and I wrote the script and synopsis up to 4 episodes...
I got it.
I will contact you after reading them.
Yes.
Anything else? Yes, by any chance, which hospital is it that Teacher Jeong is admitted?
"Teacher Jeong"...?
I mean Writer Jeong Hong Joo.
- Anthony!
- I told you he's not in the office now.
Oh, she's here now.
Teacher!
So, it was you? I was wondering which bastard dared to touch my script, but it was you!
Teacher, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
HEY! I brought a country girl from Busan, and taught and raised for 5 years, but now you dare to put your knife on your teacher's script?
Ah, wait!
Wait!
What do you mean "put my knife"?
I did it because I was told that you asked me to do it!
Who, who, WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I know, right?
Who told you that?
You told me so! You came to the studio personally, and told me that Teacher Jeong had a car accident while she had to modify the script! That's why Teacher asked me to modify it, so you said that the orange juice scene must be included!
I was attending church. You came to me personally and offered to modify the script, and in return, you brought your own script and asked me to read it.
But how come you blame me now?
What did you say?
So, your goal was to debut, I see.
No, that's not true!
No, Teacher! I'm really wronged now!
HEY!
Here is the obvious evidence, but how can you say it's misunderstanding?
Teacher!
I'm going to bury you in this drama industry field.
Let go of me!
Ah, Teacher!
No, it wasn't me! I'm saying it wasn't me!
Why on earth are you doing this to me?
What do you mean?
"What do you mean?"
All my efforts with blood and sweat, built for the last 5 years, became nothing at once, but you're saying "what do you mean?"
I am sorry.
As promised, I will read your script and if it's good, I'll contact you.
Do you think I will believe that?
Miss Lee Go Eun.
Do you know what is really innocent?
Focusing on the goal.
Whether it's money or success, I just focused on it innocently.
Representative! Are you alright?
I'm fine, so just clean that up.
Yes.
"Morning of Kyeongseong"? Japanese occupation era, in the wheels of history, a fierce life story of one man, who threw his identity away and risked his destiny.
Genre :
Noir
It's a dark story which only costs a lot of money.
Didn't it spill on your clothing?
Get rid of this too!
Yes.
Ah, Representative, the meeting is ready now.
Let's start.
Representative!
We have a big problem!
Drama "Elegant Revenge" which put a 40-year-old man to death.
What are you all doing now?
Actively explain and block all the media!
Immediately!
Yes, hello? Oh, Reporter Park, wait a second.
Call Lawyer Park and let him prepare the press release for the explanation.
Yes. All C.E.O.s of the daily newspapers, sport newspapers, internet media, editors and chiefs of portal sites which have been working with us, put all of them through to my room!
Who ordered this "speeding of death"? / Netizens, furious about the production company's C.E.O. / Even bribed the deceased's family... / Empire Production's cover-up for the accident?
Chief Editor Yoon Dae Sung of Daehan Daily is on the line 1.
Yes, Chief, this is Anthony.
Oh, Representative Kim, what has happened?
Yes, I will tell you more details later.
Chief, please block the articles first, though.
We will give you the press release soon for explanation or refutation. All other newspapers are putting up the story now, so we can't take it out alone!
I will take care of other companies too, so please take that out immediately for now.
That's, well.. Ah, Representative Kim, I need to go for a meeting, so I will call you back a little later.
Chief, Chief!
C.E.O. Kim Jong Chul of Yonhop Entertainment News is on the line 3.
Hello, this is Anthony!
We're also preparing the explanation press release, so you don't have to worry about it.
Please remove the articles now.
That's why I'm asking your favor.
You know I've helped you a lot so far, Chief.
This time, it's your turn to help me, Chief.
You shouldn't do this to me, Chief.
Team Leader Park, we've been partners for 5 years, you know that, right?
I'll not ask any more.
Only three days, please block it for three days.
Hello, hel...?
Have you forgotten who helped you to your current position? Hello, hel...? Have you forgotten who helped you to your current position?
What?
Are you done talking?
Hey, you bastards!
I'm the one who has given you money and articles so far!
Representative!
Right now, reporters are waiting in front of the company and requesting the interview.
At the end, this incident was the heartbreaking accident caused by the poor reality of drama production, which is also called "live show", and by the greed of a mega drama production company pursuing only high ratings.
Representative, Mr. Chairman is on the line.
Speaking, Mr. Chairman.
Regarding to this accident, the public demand by netizens is strong that the broadcasting station and the production company must actively work on the compensation for the family of the deceased.
Anthony, I'm really disappointed by you.
I'm sorry. Until tomorrow, the press release for refutation will be on and...
No need to say anything further.
Attend the meeting tomorrow for the Board of Directors.
Mr. Chairman...
Please give me some time to solve this.
I don't care about other people, but at least you should trust me.
I'm not saying I don't know how you feel.
But shouldn't I clean up the mess you made?
You're doomed now.
What do you mean "doomed"?
Who made "Empire Production" company as the number one in Asia?
How could you say I'm doomed?
Because of me, "Empire" is made.
The fame of "Empire" is made because of me, Anthony!
So what?
Even if I have to leave, I will leave with my own feet.
But I can't just leave.
The writers I've raised, I will leave with them all.
So are you saying you will fight till the end? You know well, that baseball is dependent on a pitcher, and a drama is dependent on a writer.
Fine. If you want, go ahead.
I don't think you have much time, though, because I won't stay still.
Don't regret.
Secretary Choi.
Starting from Top Writer Lee Mi Hun, Writer Kim, Writer Park, all others, put them through.
I've read the article very well.
Of course.
As I told you, you've put even the photo really neatly.
Anthony?
What can he do now?
I'm not the only one who wishes that bastard goes under.
Managing Director, Mr. Chairman is on the line.
I will call you later again.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Since we don't have much time, listen carefully to what I'm about to say, Director Oh.
- Yes.
- I fired Anthony a minute ago.
Do not let Anthony take any of the writers of our company, not even a single one! If you do this work properly, the next Representative of "Empire" will be you, Director Oh.
You can do that, right?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
I'll definitely finish this. Secretary Kim, before Anthony, put Writer Lee Mi Hun through, and transfer all the lines, which Secretary Choi put through to Anthony, to me!
All of them! Immediately! Writer Kim, you've hit the rating 50% three times, but don't you think the payment of 30 million won (US$30,000) per episode from "Empire" is too little?
If you come with me, I will give you 40 million won.
Writer Park is on the line 2.
Then, please don't hang up, and think it through for a moment.
Secretary Choi, what about Writer Lee (Mi Hun)?
I couldn't reach her yet.
By all means, put her through.
Yes, Writer Park, this is Anthony.
40 million won?
Writer Kim, Anthony is fired now, so he's calling the number without thinking.
What will you do with the penalty for breach of the contract with "Empire", then?
Ah, you don't need to concern about the penalty for breach of the contract.
I will get the investment and handle it right away. You know me well, I'm Anthony.
I admit that Anthony is good and resouceful. Yes, I admit that.
But, haven't you heard about Writer Jeong?
"Elegant Revenge" was mutilated by Anthony.
What do you mean "mutilated"?
It had the rating 30.2% and was placed as the top.
I will treat you as a national writer, Writer Park.
What about 50 million won per episode?
Then, please don't hang up, and think it through, yes.
Secretary Choi, what about Writer Lee?
We didn't request that side... Hey, excuse me!
Ah, yes, yes, I got it.
I will give you more time to think about it.
Writer Lee is on the line 1.
Then, please don't hang up, I will wait for your answer.
You.. you... you!
What on earth are you?
I'm Lee Go Eun who screwed up in this field because of YOU!
[Preview]
What I'm mad the most is that such a kind like you is acting up with the power in drama production field.
You will be doomed some day.
I've always lived a fancy life.
Of course, it's not like that there was no shadow in my life.
By any chance, do you have about 3 million won ($3,000)?
The problem is that the shadow has been...
Are you in that much difficulty?
continued since 3 years ago.
Oh, I guess you have something to get some investment from Japan.
About 10 billion won...?
- About 10 billion won...?
- 10 billion won?
Lee Go Eun, Lee Go Eun... Yes, the name was definitely Lee Go Eun... Go Eun, don't you want to make a drama?
Is this Writer Lee Go Eun?
BE QUIET, PLEASE!
King of dramas, Anthony can stand up again. To conquer the world again, I need you,
Lee Go Eun!
Episode 2 TheFallof theLord Y-Y-You! What on earth are you?
I'm Lee Go Eun who is screwed up in the industry because of YOU! This is the most critical moment in my life. Beat it!
Because of money... you screwed up what's most important, my life! What are all of you doing? Get her out of here!
Please leave.
I'll leave here when I'm ready. What I'm angry about the most is that my life has disintegrated because of you, a third-rate bottom feeder.
What I'm mad the most about is... that such a person like you is acting up with the power in the drama production field.
You... will be doomed one day. By someone like you.
Yes, Writer Lee. It's me, Anthony.
What are you looking at?
!
If you, Writer Lee, is the top of "Empire", that means you're the top nationally.
But the fact that the money you're paid per episode was not the top level has always troubled me.
I will make you the most.
How about 60 million per episode?
Representative Kim, I get your meaning.
I'm driving right now.
Let's talk about it later.
Ah, I need to go to a meeting.
Instead of just hanging up, can you consider it?
I'm begging you, Writer Lee.
Alright, then please give me 15 minutes.
Yes, I got it.
Let's do that.
Writer Park, have you thought about it?
I'm sorry, Representative Kim. No matter how I think about it, I can't do it because of the breach of contract penalty.
I told you I'll take care of it at my end.
Hello?
Writer Kim, have you thought about it? Representative Kim, I appreciate what you said.
Let's do it together next time.
There is no next time for my proposal.
Also, 40 million won per episode means total 800 million won! ($800,000). Rather than getting 800 million won for working like a dog,
I'd rather take 600 million won and work like the prime minister.
Hello?
Writer Kim...
Shouldn't you apologize first before talking about nothing but money first?
Hey, Representative Kim, because of you, i've been recently living by taking sleeping pills.
How can you do that?
Since when did you respect me?
I'm hanging up.
Representative Kim, haven't you been axed?
Axed?
I left on my own two feet.
Hello?
Hel...
That!
[Name #15] Jeong Hong Joo
[Name #1] Lee Mi Heon
It has to be Lee Mi Heon.
Only Lee Mi Heon.
Writer Lee, it's me, Anthony.
Writer Lee?
What should I do, Representative Kim?
Jeong...
Writer Jeong Hong Joo?
That's right.
It's Jeong Hong Joo.
Were you expecting writer Lee Min Heon?
Right now, she is beside me.
Writer Jeong, right now, I'll apologize to you.
I'm really, really sorry.
Actually, I tried to immediately phone...
You needn't apologize.
You already know.
Everybody wished to see you crash and burn.
Anthony, you're completely washed up.
Umm...
Representative?
The Chairman said you should vacate the office right now.
3 Years Later...
The Representative has arrived!
You are here?
I've always lived a brilliant life.
In the brilliant life, there can be both the light and shadow.
Of course, it doesn't mean in my life, there are no shadows.
The problem here is that shadow has been continuously with me since three years ago until now.
However, I never felt unhappy. Despite being axed from the company, despite the company's bankruptcy for which I would have to shell out 30 billion won to start anew; I was fine.
Because I'm not a kind of person who is obsessive about the past.
And I dreamed my comeback again.
However, in the industry, I notice everyone quietly avoids me.
After that, even the investments have been blocked and work has not gone well. Even when I had no office, even moving again like that, even to the extent of selling my home, it was not bad.
But...
Even if my mother were to die, I am not a person who cries.
I don't want to cry. I cannot fathom why throughout the past three years, without a regular fixed pattern, it's like this.
I don't think it is the case that there is no pattern.
Whenever you feel anxious, you're touching your finger.
Three years ago, what is the story associated with that?
Although you are brushing it off with those words, it's not so within your mind.
Please, give me medicine. Because we've stopped your medication, we could find that (pattern) out.
But because I've stopped the medication, I'm crying again, aren't I?
I don't have any more medication. Please give me some more.
Relying on medication cannot cure the disease.
You want to find out what causes mental instability fundamentally...
So what is the percentage?
What?
!
I'm asking what is the percentage of probability that I wouldn't cry without the medicine.
The probability that I wouldn't cry by taking the medication is 100%.
Please give me medicine.
Psychiatry
Welcome.
I will write a prescription for you.
But promise me, you will accept reality and overcome it.
That will be 50,000 won. (approx. $50)
It was declined.
You've arrived?
Yeah. Nothing really happened, right?
There is something that happened.
The landowner said if we didn't pay rent by the end of this month, she'll kick us out. Next. If we don't pay the gas bill on time, they're going to cut the gas.
I really hate to tell you this, but... it's been months since I've last been paid.
I couldn't pay my credit card bill, so I'm getting the push call from the card company.
I hope you will pay me by this month.
Where are you going?
I might be late so go home first.
Yes.
Please leave well.
Hello!
Hi!
Ajussi, send us two sacks of rice.
Don't be late!
Yeah.
Ahjumma!
Ahjumma!
Can I have another bottle of sesame oil?
Aigoo, you already used it all?
In here, please.
Thank you!
Take care.
[Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel]
I'm going.
The order is ready.
Mister! We're watching that, but how come you changed the channel?
Oh, please... you women...
What did you say?
Oh, seriously!
I was watching it too.
This isn't right.
Change it to a drama.
Ahjussi, it's 3:1, you're the minority.
Please just have this delicious grilled mackerel, and concede the channel to them.
Oh, the moment is gone!
I wonder what happened.
The fact that he was their son must have been revealed.
How do you know that?
Look at his expression.
It's the hospital and she is shocked from looking at the test results.
Probably, the doctor would say, "As per the test, it's 99% matched."
As per the test, it's 99% matched.
Then, at this moment, the mom would cry out the name of the son.....
Ji Wan!
That's right, the son's name is Ji Wan, Ji Wan.
You're awesome.
How?
How come you figure even the dialogue?
I know right.
You could become a writer.
You could really become a writer.
That's right, she's much better than the actual writer!
- That's right!
- Why are you serving the grilled mackerel here?
Geez. I think we must send her to the broadcasting station.
Why do you have so much to say if you came to eat some grilled mackerel?
Have you read that article?
I have. It was really epic.
Move the camera upwards and bam!
And camera #2 is coming in... Director Hong, long time, no see.
Have you been well?
Ah... hello.
Are you here to see Representative Oh?
I heard your contract with "Empire" is almost up.
You should work with me soon.
But promise me.
You must accept reality and overcome it.
That's a joke!
I have something to film so... uh... One, Two, Camera!
Representative OH JIN WAN
Proposal for a joint venture?
(A contract agreement between Jaekuk Entertainment and Watanabe Group written in Japanese)
Watanabe Group?
When is the appointment with Writer Jeong Hong Joo?
I'm sorry about the wait.
What are you doing that's making you that busy?
We were looking for some writers.
There are countless writers, but what have you done for the last 3 years, not making connection with them? Well then Sunbaenim, what brings you here without notice?
Yeah.
Do you have about $3,000 on you?
Are you having that much of a difficult time?
Huh?
Do you not have even $3,000?
No.
While I was coming here, I just hit another car slightly.
But the other person wanted to settle it in cash.
I was planning on giving him about $3,000 but I forgot my wallet at my company.
He must be waiting right now so just lend me the money since it's not that big of an amount.
Ah!
What should I do?
I too, forgot my wallet.
Why don't you just call your insurance company?
Otherwise, you can get in trouble later.
Of course.
There must be some investors from Japan right?
Huh?
I saw that a minute ago while I was waiting.
I'm having such a hard time because of this.
Why?
Are they strict?
They say this Korean-Japanese is a pretty successful businessman in Japan, but he says that he wants to invest about 10 billion won ($10 million) to a Korean drama.
10 billion won?
Sunbaenim...
This is 10 billion won project.
Since we're a big company, a proposal in such scale comes.
Who would want to deal with a tiny company for this project?
Whatever.
If you are interested, you might as well try out for it.
The condition is simple.
The background of the drama should be Japanese occupation era.
Japanese occupation era?
Yes.
He's saying that the drama should depict the fierce life story of a man, who's betting his destiny in the swirling sad history of the Japanese occupation era.
But how could we find a script like that all of a sudden?
I'm checking with the writer's group and also searching famous writers too, but all they wrote were not really satisfactory, so...
Ah, aish. Representative?
Oh!
Are you okay?
Representative Kim!
Are you okay?
Japanese occupation era, in the wheels of sad history, ...
It's fine.
Here, take these.
Put them away.
Put these away.. Ah, yes. Ah, yes.
[Morning of Kyeongseong] This script, put that in the closet.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Director Oh.
Yes, sir. The scripts in that closet, throw all of them away.
For how many years have they been in there?
Get rid of them, including the closet.
Yes, I understand.
Sunbaenim?
Sunbaenim!
We should eat dinner together, but I have an appointment.
No, take care of business.
Sunbaenim!
Sunbaenim?
!
Heehee!
Go Eun...
What?
Nothing.
Hey... Mom, just talk... what is it?
Do you... ?
Are you setting me up again on a date?
Huh?
Whose son is it going to be this time?
The veggie store?
The grocery store?
Or the seafood store?
Do you want to write dramas?
Do you want to write dramas... again?
You had said that it was good that I quit when you were paying off my debt of ten million won. Now that we are making a decent amount of money, if you want to go back to writing, you may do so.
I enjoy living my life earning money with you better.
And what do you mean we make a decent amount?
We need to save up money to buy a house. By grilling one mackerel at a time, in a thousand years?
I'll make it so that you'll be grilling 100 mackerels a day.
You're the last person to leave.
Yes, keep up the good work.
Yes.
Have a good evening!
I wonder if they turned off all the lights...
Lee Go Eun.
Her name was Lee Go Eun.
[Morning of Kyeongseong]
Writer/ Lee Go Eun
Alright, this is good enough.
After adjusting a few things, it will become quite a thing.
I hope you take a liking to this piece of work.
World Production Representative...
Anthony Kim.
Writer/ Lee Go Eun 010.298.5983
Your grilled mackerel is ready.
Please enjoy.
Please enjoy the food.
Yes.
Cut!
We'll do the customer's reactions now.
Do you have to do this?
It's taking up several tables and the lunch crowd will be here soon!
Mom, do you know how many customers will come after doing this?
I told you I will make it so that you'll be grilling 100 mackerels a day.
We're ready to start.
Yes!
Which one of you wants to be on camera?
Shall we do it from this side?
Or this side?
What's gotten into her?
[It is an international call.]
Hello.
Hello?
This is the Watanabe Secretary's office. Hello? This is the Watanabe Secretary's office.
Can I speak to Anthony Kim?
This is Anthony Kim of the World Production Company.
We can speak Japanese if you'd like.
Yes.
Our Chairman read through the entire script that you sent.
He was deeply moved by it and wants to invest in it.
Just...
Can you come to Japan together with the writer?
The Chairman is in America right now on a business related trip.
You can come tomorrow to Japan with the writer.
Hello?
Mr. Anthony Kim?
Yes, yes.
Will you be able to come tomorrow?
Of course.
Yes, I understand.
We will provide your flight. See you then.
In that case, I will see you then.
[Morning of Kyeongseong]
What irks me the most is the fact that my life is ruined by a third-rate bottom feeders' crap such as you.
What makes me mad the most is the fact that jerks like you wield all the power in the drama production field.
You... will be doomed one day. By someone like you.
As we had feared, the number is no longer in service. I've also contacted the Writer's Guild, all her classmates from writing school, and other assistant writers that may know her, but... it was of no avail.
How about Writer Jeong?
After all, she worked under Writer Jeong for 5 years. She doesn't know, either?
No.
Representative...
How about hiring a private investigator?
A private investigator?
You want me to find someone based on just the name of Lee Go Eun and her disconnected phone number.
In that kind of situation I charge five million.
Five million won? (around $4,600)
We have to find her in 5 hours.
If that's the case, then 8 million won.
If you don't like my price, you can go somewhere else.
Why don't you give it a thought.
Representative, how are we going to get 8 million won out of nowhere?
If you give them a discount, they'll take it for granted.
While the price is steep, he's not saying that it's impossible to do.
When food was scarce during the Enlightenment period, people started grilling mackerels instead of ribs.
Although in the present generation we have a lot of food...
Grilled mackerel?
It looks really delicious.
Representative...
Mmm!
Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel It's really delicious!
Well, what should we do?
Have you made up your mind?
Never mind.
Huh?
I said never mind.
Rep...
Rep-Representative!
I'll give you a discount.
How about 7 million?
Seven million?
Aren't you coming?
Ah, yes.
Alright, 5 million.
What a deal. 5 million!
Too high?
4.5 million!
4 million!
Or just even one million won!
Your mackerel is ready!
Enjoy your meal!
Enjoy!
Veggie refills, please.
Alright.
Excuse me!
Is my grilled mackerel ready yet?
Yes, just a minute.
Ah, hello!
Please wait for a bit.
That TV gig worked like a charm!
The real charm is in your grilled mackerels!
Your mackerel is ready!
Please enjoy!
One moment!
Yes, this is Eun Yi's Grilled Mackerel.
Can I speak with Writer Lee Go Eun?
Huh?
Is Writer Lee Go Eun available?
I'm sorry, I can't hear.
Who?
Writer Lee Go Eun, is she available?
Hello?
Yeah, that's me.
This is the drama production company "World Productions".
We were looking for a script for our next drama, and we happened to read your "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Yes ...
Just a minute.
Everyone, be quiet for a minute!
Yes, you were saying?
Do you happen to be bound by a contract or production company?
No, thats not a problem.
That's good.
Our company would like to make your "Morning of Kyeongseong" into a drama. What do you think?
My "Morning of Kyeongseong"?
Yes, if it's ok with you, I would like to meet with you today.
Today?
Where do I need to go to?
No, I will come to you.
Umm... Miss Lee Go Eun, it's been a while.
Have you been well since the last time I saw you?
Get out right now.
Miss Lee Go Eun.
I said to get out.
Writer Lee...
I told you to get lost, you jerk!
Will you not let go?
I know that I made a mistake back then.
"Writer Lee"?
After kicking me out of the field of drama writing, you've got some nerves to call me "Writer Lee."
Because of you, I've been called a sell-out who backstabbed her mentor and other harsh names.
Because of you, my future as a writer was hopelessly crushed and utterly destroyed.
Three years have passed, and you just show up and want to produce my drama?
I'm sorry. I sincerely am.
That's why I've come here to apologize.
Three years ago, you seemed to think that my work was a worthless piece of crap.
What happened?
Do you suddenly like it?
Because it's sincere.
Who are you trying to fool?
Just tell me the truth.
Yes, your script is crappy and mediocre at best, but it has some potential.
I'm after that potential.
I told you not to talk rubbish, just tell me the truth!
I got a rich geezer hooked on your script.
You ...
You... are really low.
Get lost.
Before getting lost, I'll just say one thing.
I don't know if you've heard, but I'm completely broke.
All I have is an overdrawn bank account and that crappy old car over there. I'm behind on my rent payment, too.
However ...
I can rise again.
The King of Dramas Anthony can rise again.
To conquer the world again, I... need you, Lee Go Eun.
I ...
don't need you.
So get out.
Didn't you hear what my kid said?
I guess making the daughter of me, Park Kang Ja, miserable three years ago wasn't enough for you.
If you don't want to die by my hand get out right now.
I'll say one more final word.
I told you to get out right now...
Hey... that guy said he would say just one more thing and then go.
Let's hear what he's got to say!
Yes, let's hear him out.
Fine, I'm a coldblooded, repulsive jerk. But what does that have to do with you?
What does me being a jerk have to do with you giving up your dream instead of pursuing it?
So you want to spend the rest of your life here serving mackerel?
Just be content with telling your child one day, "Your mother also used to have a dream once."
Dreams aren't there to be reminisced, but rather, to be fulfilled.
And the only chance to fulfill this dream will be gone after tonight.
Okay.
It's okay if you hate me.
But don't do something you'll be sorry for, for the rest of your life.
What are you looking at?
Just stuff your faces with mackerels!
Good night.
Good night. Mr. Kim, you had too many drinks tonight.
What?
Another bottle of soju, please.
Ah, yes.
Please visit again!
The food was good!
Drive safely!
Oh, hello!
This was my last ray of hope after everything else has failed.
Will it all end this way?
Two more dishes of grilled mackerels, please.
Two more grilled mackerels.
Do you plan on living your entire life grilling mackerels like this?
And then are you going to tell your children that you had a dream at one point of your life?
Dreams aren't something to look back on when you grow older.
Dreams are there to be pursued.
It's fine if you hate me.
But just don't do something you will regret for the rest of your life.
Mom...
I'm sorry.
I want to go.
That's fine.
You must pursue your dream.
Don't worry about mom.
Go.
Anyways, you ...
had no skill at grilling mackerels.
This is for the best.
Mom... Silly girl, I just fired you!
Fine, I can't back down like this.
You've made the right decision. I'll tell you two things. First,
I really hate people like you.
Nasty, dirty, greedy, soulless sell-outs.
You should keep that in mind.
Thank you.
I'm going to kill you for real. As long as you don't kill me painfully, please.
My mom also has a message for you.
If you make me cry one more time, she's going to slit your throat.
This is quite a tough family.
Fine. Now, it's my turn to talk.
You've got to watch your language, young lady.
Mind your tongue if you want to work with me.
I understand, Representative.
What would you like me to do?
Pack your bags and get in this car.
And then?
We're going to the airport.
Don't forget your passport.
Why the airport?
Why do you think? To take a plane, of course!
The man who thought your script was great, wants to meet you in Japan.
Anthony Kim-sama and Lee Go Eun-sama, it is an honor to have both of you aboard
Chairman Watanabe's personal airplane.
This plane is AIR-WK Number 501.
We plan to arrive on Hukuoka Airport at 2:15 P.M.
I hope this will be a comfortable trip for both of you.
Do you think I'll sign a contract without a contract fee?
Why don't you have a contract fee?
It's written right there.
That I will give you the money after I receive the investment fee.
You know my situation well enough.
Then why did you get on the plane?
Because I'm a villager from Busan who has never ridden a plane before.
Why?
What is that for?
It's your contract fee.
There's nothing more I can do even if you glare at me.
That's all I have.
If you can't trust me, then don't believe me, believe Sejong (king on currency).
Let me take that.
Where is your hotel?
Jae Guk hotel please.
You will be picked up tomorrow morning at 10.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Huh?
Do you know how much it costs to spend a night here?
Taxi!
What's with him?
!
How much is a one-night stay here?
Ten thousand yen!
Can you give me a discount for two rooms?
No way, no way!
What do we do?
They only have one room.
Huh?
Is it really true that there's only one room left? Writer Lee isn't even Kim Tae Hee or Song Hae Gyo (korean actresses), do you think I would be crazy to joke about this?
Turn off the lights.
It's already 8 o'clock.
Wake up now.
What kind of writer sleeps so much?
Being a girl, you grind your teeth and snore.
Good morning.
The president is waiting.
He's prepared a yacht and a car.
What kind of a person is Chairman Watanabe that he wants to fully fund the drama production?
I told you.
He's a Korean-Japanese business man loaded with money.
So you're saying he looked at my script and liked it?
You wish.
You wouldn't even be here if I hadn't fudged the facts.
What do you mean? All you've got is 5 years of experience as an assistant writer, with no publications, not even a debut experience, not to mention the fact that you were excommunicated from the field and wasted 3 years away.
Then...
What did you tell him?
I told him to meet you in person.
Ne quid nimis (nothing in excess).
Too much fudging can backfire.
The only reason he's investing on this project is his trust in me, so don't make any mistakes and do well! so don't make any mistakes and do well!
Fine.
He's a man after all,
The president has arrived.
This person is the writer?
Yes, she is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Reading your work brought back long-forgotten memories of my homeland and my days of youth.
As he read your work, he wondered whether this inexperienced rookie writer would be worth his investment.
The whole time I was reading your script, I was so moved by it, that I just had to see the writer in person.
The whole time he was reading, he saw plot holes here and there, but because he trusts producer Anthony he has decided to invest in our drama.
Did you conceive the idea for the script yourself?
He asked whether the story was your own idea.
Answer him.
Though I didn't experience this painful era of our history myself, Because she didn't experience this painful era of our history herself,
I wanted to write about the life of a man whose destiny was entwined around that tragic period.
she had a writer's block, but it was fate that led her to a crucial mentor, which would be me, and I gave her some advice and that's how she was able to finish writing her script.
Ah, so Anthony Kim is the writer's saviour.
Then, I will trust you Anthony Kim and your writer.
I will sign a contract with you.
What did he say? That based on his trust on the producer, Anthony, he will sign a contract with us!
Really?
Oh, thank you!
(In Japanese) Thank you.
I have one condition though.
Thi...this year?
Within this year, together with my beloved wife Akiko
I would like to watch "KyeongSeong's Morning."
Your wife...
She's very beautiful!
The only requirement for my investment in this production is that it needs to come out within this year.
For this year, the drama broadcasting schedule has already been decided, so... is that it needs to come out within this year. For this year, the drama broadcasting schedule has already been decided, so...
Do you have a particular reason for wanting it to come out this year? I can't tell you that.
Can you promise me?
Mr. Anthony?
Of course!
Within this year, I will definitely show you the drama.
Your word is not enough.
Once I get our drama assigned within this year's broadcast schedule, I will accept your investment.
How about that?
Alright.
Let's sign the contract immediately, then.
I'll deposit a down payment of 1% within today.
And I will provide the investment money in three installments as stated in the contract.
This way, please.
We're really making my drama!
This isn't a dream, is it?
So giggly and happy over that?
Don't do anything rash and just focus on perfecting your script.
Just get it scheduled for broadcast this year, and I get 9.9 billion.
In total, 10 billion won!
I'm finally making a comeback.
My empire is all starting again!
I'll show you what I can do, Mom.
I'll definitely show you hat I can become a drama writer you need not be ashamed of. I said that I wouldn't write dramas again, but this destiny-like opportunity...
I can't miss it!
The opportunity is already in my hand.
This is my destiny!
Born to be the King of Dramas, my destiny! To the people who have misunderstood me until this day To the bastards that have looked down on me my earnest sincerity with a bloody, mighty rule,
I'll show them! I'll get my revenge!
(In Japanese)How are you?
(In Japanese) I am fine.
Aigoo.
Who's there?
Is someone there?
(In Japanese) Stop!
(In Japanese) Please...spare me..
(In Japanese) I won't do it again... ever!
The person who breaks his promise dies.
Just what in the world are you doing?
It is human nature to break a promise.
But the person who breaks his promise to me definitely dies.
Who's there?
Thank you for watching King of Dramas with us.
Please follow our channel.
Have to air it within this year..!
There's no question that the biggest productions get scheduled first.
People only know Kang Hyun Min as a big star, but he's in fact the biggest idiot there is. Mr. Kang Hyun Min, this is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Get up and put your hands up if you don't want to die.
Did you fall for Anthony's deceptions again?
Why don't you sign a contract with us?
We'll make the best offer ever made to a rookie.
Do whatever it takes. Get her!
Episode 3 The Return of the King But the person who breaks their promise to me definitely dies. Who's there?
It's me, Akiko. It's late, are you not going to sleep...? Since you weren't beside me, I couldn't sleep.
Let's go home. Please don't make any noise. Y-You speak Korean...
I'm a Korean drama fan. Of course, I know some Korean.
Could you have possibly heard earlier... ?
Oh, your translation with lies?
Don't worry.
I didn't say a word to my husband.
Were you that surprised?
My husband doesn't kill people often, though.
Then... Chairman Watanabe...
He's the best yakuza (gangster) in Kyushu area.
Watanabe Finance with 40 years of history, he's the boss of that yakuza.
My husband is a bit hard-edged and cold-blooded, but you don't know how gentle and tender he is usually.
Then ...
Then the Chairman of the Watanabe Group is... Of course, it's a "group".
You can't even guess how many "team leaders" he has.
As long as you keep the promise that you would show us the drama within this year, you won't die, so don't worry.
And you asked earlier why the drama must be on TV within this year.
This... is a secret.
In fact, my husband has the last stage of stomach cancer.
So you must definitely keep your promise!
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but...
Low-grade...
What do I do?
Should I tell him that I can't do it now?
No, how hard it was to get this opportunity! If I lose this chance, I might not have any chance to come back, not only even in three years but forever!
But life is more important!
I can't be killed by a yakuza with last-stage stomach cancer!
Wouldn't it be better to tell him that I can't do this, before it becomes too late?
What?
You've come here and now you say you can't do it?
If someone goes back on their word with me they die. Whether being killed by a yakuza's boss, or dying later after failing to come back forever, anyway it's all the same.
I have only one life, so who cares even if I use his money?
The dice of destiny is already cast anyway.
Representative!
The Japanese Watanabe Group are on the line holding.
Good afternoon, Mr. Tanaka.
I'm Empire Productions Representative Oh Jin Wan.
How are you doing? About that investment you told me about earlier, is it okay to send a script over now?
Yes?
I'm sorry.
We have decided to sign with the World Production agency.
World Production?
Anthony, that jerk!
It's not like somebody is chasing us. Please, let's go together.
To put the drama on TV within this year, we have no time to lose, not a second.
Within this year?
Yes, broadcasting the drama within this year is the condition of his investment.
There are just a few months left this year, how can we get a broadcasting time slot?
I can do that, so you'd better focus on your script now.
The real war is just started from now on.
Representative, congratulations!
The deposit is wired to our account.
As if it's so new to us..
Why aren't you coming in?
Oh, it's Writer Lee.
You've seen him before, right? He's Joo Dong Seok, the producer.
You're having lunch.
Well, I'm done now. Come over, take a seat.
By the way, where is my desk?
Oh, it's over there.
Here, Miss Writer.
Okay.
Then, where is the room that I'll be sleeping in?
It's over there. Show her inside.
Huh?
Yes.
Over here.
Over here, Miss Writer.
I'm done.
Representative?
Shouldn't you give me a minimum space so that I can work on my writing?
What's wrong?
You're not fat, but is that space too small?
No, I mean, it's not small, but it's too lacking...
It's too lacking, I agree.
Congratulations, Sunbaenim.
I rushed to come here, so I couldn't bring anything.
I heard you got the investment from Watanabe Group in Japan.
That's really just amazing!
We were lucky.
And your help was great too, Representative Oh.
What do you mean "lucky"?
It was solely because of your competence.
Oh, it's Writer Lee.
It's been awhile.
How have you been?
I thought you two were having a bad connection, but I guess I was wrong.
Like me, I thought Writer Lee also wished sunbae's business to be ruined, but I was wrong about that too.
Like me?
Yes.
Three years ago, when the quick-service biker died.
How could all the details of that accident be on the media maliciously?
Why?
Why were all those articles pouring out without giving us any chance to block them?
Haven't you doubted that?
Perhaps ...
You?
Yes.
That tip-off was done by me.
I mean... why, you?
Why?
You don't know? For 7 years, under you, I had done all kinds of work, but although I'd cleaned up all crap you made, you took all the credit.
Did you think I would live forever as the second man of "Empire", the subordinate of Anthony?
How could you?
How could...?
How dare you?
!
"How dare... you?"
I should be saying that to you.
The representative of "Empire" now is...
ME.
Such a person like you who uses cheap tricks to make just one drama. A loser like you who hit rock bottom can't dare to confront me, the most powerful man in drama production industry, the King of the Empire is ME!
Drop that useless hope, please.
With the investment contract which will become invalid if the show can't be aired within this year, you can't fight against me.
Therefore, please just stay broken quietly. If you still want to get that tiny bit of respect as sunbae.
What are you watching so intently?
What did I do?
I'm just cleaning.
Miss Writer Lee.
Let's talk for a little bit.
I have something to show you.
This is the writer's room prepared by Empire Production for you, Writer Lee Go Eun.
Earlier, I was a bit too enraged, so I said rude things.
Please understand.
Why don't you sign a contract with us, Empire Production?
I signed a contract with World Production's Anthony Kim.
How much did you receive for that contract?
Well, the contract...
It doesn't matter.
I don't think Anthony gave you a proper payment for the contract because he came to me to borrow $3,000 a few days ago.
And even if you received some, we will pay the penalty for breach of the contract for you and give you the best condition you can get as a rookie writer. Ten million won ($10,000) per episode, the advance payment 100 million won for contract, and the rest of the payment 100 million won, so total 200 million won ($200,000).
Are you being like this to me in order to get your revenge on him?
If you thought of me as such a small (petty) person, then I'm a bit disappointed.
Oh, I heard that the investment from Watanabe of Japan was done solely because of your script, Writer Lee Go Eun.
By any chance, were you deceived by Anthony, again?
Writer Lee, even if you're working with Anthony, your script won't be able to be aired.
As soon as you sign a contract with us... Well, was it "Morning of Kyeongseong"?
That script will be proceeded right away and be aired, I guarantee you.
But....
This is the key for this apartment.
While staying here, please take your time to consider this offer.
Tomorrow afternoon, I will come to see you with the contract.
Don't forget.
That Anthony will never be able to make this drama.
Did Writer Lee not say where she was going?
Well, when I was back from the rest room, she was already gone.
What about her phone?
No matter how many times I try, she doesn't answer her phone. But you know, Director. Since we got the advance deposit, can't we have some delicious food?
Our destiny depends on how to use that money.
What about the new recruits?
They will come to work here by 3 PM.
Are you not eating?
You can eat the rest.
I heard that the investment from Watanabe of Japan was done solely because of your script, Writer Lee Go Eun.
By any chance, were you deceived by Anthony, again?
I will give you the best condition you can get as a rookie writer.
10 million won ($10,000) per episode, the advance payment 100 million won for contract, and the rest of the payment 100 million won, so in total 200 million won ($200,000).
As soon as you sign a contract with us, that script will be proceeded right away and be aired, I guarantee you.
Don't forget. Anthony will definitely not be able to make this drama.
Mom?
Our Writer Lee Go Eun, are you writing the script well?
By the way, Mom, would it be important to keep the promise with a person I can't trust?
Or would it be more important to choose the guaranteed future, not keeping that promise?
Is something going on?
Oh no. I'm just saying.
This child...
Why are you thinking hard about such an easy thing?
What's so important about the promise with a person you can't trust? The future with the guaranteed success is more important, of course.
I guess so, right?
Of course!
Auntie! Please give the food quickly!
I'm busy right now so I will call you later okay?
Alright.
This person is unavailable right now.
The signal is on, but she's not picking up the phone.
Anyway, I sent a text message that we will have a meeting at 3PM today, so she will come by then.
Director?
We're ready to have the meeting.
Writer Lee?
Miss Writer Lee Go Eun?
Thank you for giving me such a good opportunity, but I wish my drama would be made to give hope to everyone, not to step on someone.
I can't take this opportunity by breaking a promise.
I'm sorry.
My first script, "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be made by World Production as promised.
We couldn't even contact you. What in the world happened?
I'm late only by 3 minutes.
What?
Are you saying you ignored the calls on purpose?
Well, my friend told me to stay at her apartment if I don't have any place to stay, so I went there... You went there, and...? It looked great outside, but even the cell phone didn't work there, and it was too luxurious for me to stay there.
The place where people live should be more humane, don't you think so?
As promised, I sent the contract payment to your account, so check it later.
Hurry up and go in. Everyone is waiting for you.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Call Writer Jeong.
What?
"Elegant Revenge 2" will be aired this year.
For that, Park Shin Yang (a famous Korean actor) is going to take the main role next year...
We can do the casting again.
Director.
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
Call a meeting immediately.
Yes, sir.
This is Han Kang Wook, who newly joined World Production as a producer.
Yes, nice to meet you. Yes.
He's good at the producer work but not good at family matters, so he divorced two years ago.
And here is Team Leader Park Seok Hyun for finance.
I'm still single, no need to worry about being divorced.
He's single, no chance to get married, so don't care about him.
And here is Goo Yi Jae, the youngest staff for errands.
Please take care of me!
I'm Goo Yi Jae of Production team.
And this is...
Yes!
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Please take care of me!
So now we've done our introductions. Everyone here who will share the destiny with our World Production, as you can see, the level of our office is on the ground.
But... remember this...
The bank account with 670,000 won ($670) and this small, humble office are the ground we will newly start, but with the advance deposit 100 million won, up there, we'll head to the top. To do that, what you will do from now on is to win the broadcasting schedule so that this drama can be aired within this year.
Aired within this year?
Airing it within this year is the condition for the investment.
The rest of the investment fund of 9.9 billion won, a total of 10 billion won ($10 million) worth drama, "Morning of Kyeongseong"
definitely needs to be aired within this year.
What will happen if it can't be aired within this year?
We die. Currently for Monday and Tuesday of the K Broadcasting station (implying KBS), "Days of Passion" is being aired now, and after this, a historic drama with 50 episodes is planned. For Wednesday and Thursday, "Heaven" with 20 episodes, and after this, the drama of Director Jeong Seong Chan is planned, so this year's broadcasting schedule has already been completed.
What about M Broadcasting (implying MBC)? M Broadcasting has already completed it's broadcasting schedule for this year, and the place which has the time room for this year is only November for Monday-Tuesday of S Broadcasting (implying SBS).
"Top Secrets"...
Wasn't it casting the actor Choi Tae Joon?
This early morning, Tae Joon had a big accident during the first shooting, so he needs to rest for 8 week.
If he needs 8 weeks, the shooting will be canceled soon.
Yes. The media is talking about his "displaying the fighting spirit for the drama" in real time, but we should consider that his drama is actually going to be canceled.
Then, are you saying they're releasing the false information to the media?
For the production company, they've already lost hundreds of million won, so we can say they are making a frantic last-ditch effort. For the actor, since he can't keep acting for the drama, he's just trying to maintain his image, that's all.
Then the remained spot is only November for S Broadcasting...
Fine.
Make a list of actors in their 30's who can play for "Morning of Kyeongseong" aired in November.
Let's go with November, S Broadcasting.
Representative!
Even so, broadcasting it in November is...
November in this year at S Broadcasting.
This is the matter of life or death of our Empire Production.
No matter what it takes, we must get that time slot! Since the top actors in our company are not available anyway, make a list for top actors of other companies and call the meeting again.
The meeting is starting again.
Tell them I'll be there soon.
Why did you come back again?
Huh?
Why did you come back again, not going to Oh Jin Wan?
How did you know...? You make a lot of fuss for even a small matter, but you were out of reach after going out to dump garbage, and came back one day later.
Moreover, right after Oh Jin Wan visited.
And then saying all the nonsense about a friend and the luxurious apartment or whatnot.
Did you think I would fall for your lame acting?
I guess the luxurious apartment part must be true. Oh Jin Wan, not your friend, showed it to you, though.
Why?
Why did you come back to me?
Is the reason really that important?
It's not that important, but I'm very curious.
People like you wouldn't understand, but there are principles and promises to some people.
And there are some people who live to keep those things even if they don't have much.
I just kept them, that's all.
How grateful I am.
It's not for your sake.
Of course it's for mine.
So it wasn't anything special.
And I've told you before.
It's not "you". It's "Representative."
S
K
K
M Since you came from the movie industry, if I make an example in that side, if you made a movie, you need to release it through movie theaters.
Yes.
But in our field, there are only three theaters.
So-called "3 companies of ground-wave".
If you can't get the time slot through these three, the drama production itself is impossible, far from releasing part.
Then, the competition to get the time slot must be really fierce.
That's right.
But the golden time for a drama is 10pm!
The number of the drama production companies which are desperately trying to get that time slot is 248, counting only Korean companies. Even if we count only three writers per each company, 248 by 3.. 3 by 8 is 24, and.... 248 by 3.. 3 by 8 is 24, and....
It's 744 : 1.
So, if we think about it's probability....
Don't you have the calculator?
0.134%.
It's just 0.1%, no need to round it up.
You will see with your own eyes from now on how hard it is to get the time slot.
Let's start the casting.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Excluding the actors who belong to our Empire Production, these are the actors who can play for the drama which will be aired in November.
Lee Jeong Shik and Oh Tae Yeon, do you think they can be the top (main role)?
Exclude them.
Remove Jeong Do Jin too. He can be the top for a daily soap opera, but he doesn't have the mask for a mini-series.
About Cha Seung Hyun....
Isn't he going to film a movie in December?
Cha Seung Hyun can't work with us because of the movie.
Who do you think would be okay for the main role, Writer Lee?
While writing the script, haven't you considered any among these guys?
How about Yoo Ha Yeon?
I think he's the most similar one to the main role's image.
He's not good because he's a junkie.
I heard he quit last year.
The most unreliable words in the world is that a junkie says he quit the drug and the game-addict says he quit gambling.
Even so, he's one of the top three in Korea. That's true, but although the newspaper didn't report it yet, the prosecutor's office already finished it's internal investigation, so there is a rumor they would blow it right before the presidential election.
Tell him to blow the lunch box bomb by himself.
How about Seo Tae Ha, Director?
But would he want to play the role for a "revenge" drama again?
He has a severe depression issue, so as far as I know, he has been getting therapy for months.
What a moron...
Acting must be done by acting...
Next actor.
Is depression a sin?
Well... I didn't mean that, but...
Then should we go with Seo Tae Ha?
Ah, forget it.
Who else is left?
Kim Jin Ho and Kang Hyun Min.
Kim Jin Woo has a lot of female fans.
He's very hot now, not only in Korea but also in other countries.
Not only S Broadcasting, but also all three stations can't resist him.
Let's go with Kim Jin Woo, Representative.
Not him.
Now what?
If I say no, then no.
Well do you have a reason to say no?
You don't need to know.
Why are you leaving Kim Jin Woo out and going with Kang Hyun Min?
Why on earth are you saying we need to go with Kang Hyun Min? "Elegant Revenge 2", November at S Broadcasting, let's go with Kang Hyun Min for its male main.
Prepare for that.
Yes.
Excuse me, Director Heo..
It has been only for a short while since you were scouted to our Empire after staying in the U.S. for years.
So I guess you don't know well, so that's why I'm telling you this.
Kim Jin Woo really hates Anthony.
Why?
Back in the day, Anthony stole Kim Jin Woo's woman.
So what?
What does that have to do with us?
Of course it has something to do, with our Representative. Among top actors, Kim Jin Woo and Kang Hyun Min who can be used for November, the one Anthony can select is only Kang Hyun Min.
This fight can be defined as the total war between Anthony, who will put his life on the line to have Kang Hyun Min for the casting, and our Representative Oh.
Currently, Kang Hyun Min is considering "Getting Married to My Man," and...
By the Writer Gong Ji Young?
Representative, Kang Hyun Min is doing a fan meeting at the Diamond Hall of Ace Hotel.
It ends at 5 o'clock.
Prepare a clean copy of the script. I'm taking off.
Yes.
What are you doing?
I'm making myself engrave him in my mind. That way he can be alive in the script.
So have you engraved him well?
The more I think about it, the more I like it.
He looks intelligent, with an air of melancholy about him.
Once you see him in person, you'll find out in less than a minute how intelligent and melancholic he is.
What...
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains.
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas.
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be
You raise me up to more than I can be
Long time no see!
Yes, hello.
You should be holding fanmeetings in Japan and China besides this crowded Seoul.
So I should.
I have a good drama in the makings, you should work with me.
You're still making dramas these days?
I got an investment of 10 billion won from Japan.
Good for you.
I'll get the November broadcasting slot at S Broadcasting.
I did hear that Tae Joon has been seriously injured.
I guess he couldn't get up this time.
I'll cut to the chase. This is my offer.
The best rate in the nation, 100 million won per episode.
100 million?
20 episodes, so 2 billion. Once you sign the contract, you'll be paid the total amount within 15 days.
Yes?
The total amount?
I guarantee you the quality of the drama.
Moreover, as it's being funded by a Japanese source, we can even try for a national broadcast in Japan.
Then...
It's the birth of a new Hallyu Star.
You'll be rolling in dough. To tell it like it is,
I know that you need big money for the shopping mall business that you started beyond your means.
If you just sign the document you get 2 billion.
What about the script?
Have a good look at it and meet me at the restaurant at the Cheongdam intersection.
I'll do that.
Read it fast, but pay attention.
It's a voucher worth 2 billion.
You're really cool, Representative.
But do you think Kang Hyun Min will come there?
There is one thing people know about Kang Hyun Min and one thing they don't.
Although they know that Kang Hyun Min is a star, they don't know that he's the world's biggest idiot who only knows money.
He will come without question.
I'm going!
I, Kang Hyun Min, am getting 2 billion and going to the world!
Go to Hollywood, let's go partytime.
Kwang Soo, turn it up!
Empire's Representative Oh Jin Wan Hey turn it off!
Yes, Representative Oh.
Hello!
I've heard that you were being bothered by some pathetic scripts lately.
I'm calling to disperse your worries a bit.
We're planning to do Jeong Hong Ju's project, how about it?
If it's Writer Jeong Hong Ju...
Elegant Revenge 2?
Wasn't Shin Yang hyung going to do that?
It's Empire's best drama, of course we have to go with Korea's best actor.
Oh my God.
Aren't you just asking me because Shin Yang refused it?
What are you talking about?
To me, the best actor in Korea is always Kang Hyun Min, no question about it.
Please send the script, then.
In any case, it's Writer Jeong Hong Ju who can turn everything to gold.
That guarantees the quality of the work.
What month is the broadcast?
November. At S Broadcasting.
November at S Broadcasting?
Why?
No, it's nothing.
Ah, right.
You know the guy called Anthony, don't you?
By Anthony you mean... Ah, the person who was at Empire in the past.
It looks like he's trying to start again with a Japanese investment of 10 billion.
Didn't he come look for you?
No, he didn't.
Ah...
I heard there's a problem with the Japanese contract.
At any rate, I'll send the contract to your agency.
Give me a call when you make up your mind.
I understand, have a good day.
Yes!
Dang, now I'm confused.
Hey, hurry up and turn around.
Huh?
Hyung, what about the charity event for senior citizens?
Listen, it's a matter of billions of money.
I can care less about those senior citizens!
Just turn around, now!
Man, I'm so confused.
Anthony...
I see that he got to talk to Kang Hyun Min before I did...
What do you think?
What did you think, Hyung? Darling, if I had the brains to tell whether a script is good or not, would I ask you?
I really like it.
I've never seen any drama like this before.
It's refreshing.
Is it..?
But Hyung, shouldn't you be talking to the Representative?
Don't worry, I can talk to him after making up my mind.
Telling them too soon will only cause headaches.
Then, Hyung, what are you going to do?
This one or the Empire's?
Well... honestly...
I like this, but... but I'm not sure if Anthony really got funding from a Japanese source or if he's bluffing...
Hyung, if it's not certain isn't it better to go with Empire?
Empire.
Empire.
Empire.
Gosh, this gives me a headache.
Kang Hyun Min's Manager just called.
His highschool teacher died, so he had to go to the funeral.
So he can't come here today.
It's Oh Jin Wan.
Pardon?
The Empire has targeted Kang Hyun Min and played some tricks.
Seonbaenim.
It's me.
I see that you talked to Hyun Min already.
What the...
Why are you so obsessed with Kang Hyun Min?
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Do you think I really like that idiot who can't even write his own name in Chinese?
His voice is pathetic, he thinks acting is all about posing, he's such a stuck-up who's crazy about money.
Why would I be obsessed with him?
I'm just... using him to destroy you, Seonbaenim.
Is this... a challenge?
The one sitting on the throne of the Empire is me.
And as long as I'm Empire's Representative, you definitely won't be able to make a comeback.
Representative, it's a bad news!
Kang Hyun Min, confirmed casting for Elegant Revenge 2
Seeing that they've already published news articles about casting Kang Hyun Min for Elegant Revenge 2, I guess the Empire has already taken action.
Find out where Kang Min Hyung is.
Right now.
Yes.
I'm going to Kang Hyun Min's house.
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to see that intelligent actor with an air of melancholy?
Me too?
Since we don't have a director yet, we should at least introduce the rookie writer to him.
Should I go?
Where on earth do you think he went?
That's what I want to ask now.
Yes?
We found him, Director.
Today is an actor Kim Jin Woo's birthday and everyone is inside a VIP room drinking alcohol.
Thank you, thank you!
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Hey. You're really made the right choice. I just came back from China after filming some drama there, but Anthony, that son of b**ch, is acting up to come back, I guess.
He can't come back. He's a jerk you should never work with.
Why do you not like that guy?
You don't have to know that far.
It's not just one or two people who hate Anthony in this field.
Oh, that's right. Thinking of that, the girl you dated with a few years ago, Anthony took her away from you, right?
Who did that?
Got it? Okay!
Cheers.
It's been a long time.
Wow, indeed, I can't win over you, Representative Kim.
Want a drink?
We should do introductions.
This is Writer Lee Go Eun, the writer of "Morning of Kyeong Seong".
Hello.
Director, you really...
This there a reason for me to meet this person?
How much do you want?
Did you not see the article?
I will give you more (money) than Empire. How much do you want?
Representative, I've decided to work for "Elegant Revenge 2".
Okay, fine.
You can trust Empire Production.
But, you'd better not trust Oh Jin Wan of Empire Production.
What on earth is the reason that you're so obsessed for Kang Hyun Min?
Why would I be?
Do you think I'm doing this because I like that guy who is too ignorant to write his own name in Chinese characters?
He has terrible vocal, and thinks his acting is the best.
That rude jerk who is crazy about only money, why would I obsess about him?
I'm just... using him to destroy you, Sunbaenim.
Hey, you guys, leave us alone.
I'm going crazy... Representative Oh, that son of b**ch!
Geez, how embarrassing!
Are you insane?
Did you have to turn it on in front of those guys?
Are you going to do it or not?
I'll do it.
But will just ask you something.
Why are you two like that to each other?
I will tell you truthfully.
This is the war between me and Oh Jin Wan of Empire Production.
And you're now on board of my ship.
The war. It's already started. During the first shooting of "Top Secrets", the drama which was planned to be aired in November, because of some accident of Choi Tae Joon, the main actor, he was recommended to have 8 weeks of rest and he's now getting treated at the hospital.
Production team for this drama decided that no more shooting is possible.
so the drama "Top Secrets" is canceled. As for its replacement drama, we're looking into all possible options with open-mind, but so far, there is nothing decided yet.
Director! There is a rumor that "Elegant Revenge 2" will replace that, but is it true?
Please tell us more!
Is it true that Writer Jeong Hong Joo's drama will be aired?
Then, what is the best among those options?
Director, it's of course "Elegant Revenge 2" of Empire Production.
It seems that Kang Hyun Min is in the casting. Well, it's not like he has signed a contract, and there is only its title, not even the synopsis, so how can we say if it's good or bad?
CP Na, how could say that?
If Writer Jeong Hong Joo heard that, she would've been upset.
What Na Moon Young said isn't totally wrong.
Even if it's Jeong Hong Joo from Empire, we don't have to beg her first.
Then, what's the best among the dramas with scripts? Well, considering only the drama itself, "Morning of Kyeong Seong" is the best.
Kang Hyun Min is going to work with me for my drama.
Yes, Reporter Park.
I've met him in this morning and finished all the discussion.
He's on bad terms with his Representative, so he even asked me (for this role).
What do you mean, Empire?
Hyun Min said he hasn't even met anyone from Empire. [Kang Hyun Min, didn't even meet production team for "Elegant Revenge 2"]
Will he play in a drama which doesn't even have a script? [Will Kang Hyun Min play for Elegant Revenge 2? - no script is made yet.]
That's right, he said it was just one of all dramas he was looking into.
[Kang Hyun Min 'Elegant Revenge 2' Cast "NO!"]
Director!
Right now Kang Hyun Min-
So you're trying to do some media play?
In real time, the refutation news is being uploaded.
What shall we do?
What shall we do?
Contact the representative of his agency.
Aigoo, seriously!
Hey!
How could you decide such important matter without me?
If you discuss with me, will I take more commission from you?
Hyun Min, it's Empire, Empire!
Do you want to fight against Representative Oh and finish your actor's life?
Aigo, seriously, you brat.
Hyun Min! Damn! I've lost my face in front of my friends, but if I work with Reprentative Oh, those guys will think of me a moron!
I will make Representative Oh apologize to you!
Do you want him to apologize in front of all those guys?
Oh, I don't know!
I don't know, I don't know!
Director Oh Aigo, I could barely persuade Hyun Min.
Yes.
Please don't worry.
All those articles which Anthony released are now removed.
I've just received that report.
[Kang Hyun Min, reconfirmed to act for "Elegant Revenge 2"]
So, who finally got hold of Kang Hyun Min, Reprentative Oh or Anthony?
Well, I can't figure it out, either.
There are even some articles which disappear if you click them.
But if you go to some other sites, again you can find... Tell both of them to come to my office immediately.
Sunbaenim, I think I clearly warned you.
Then, I will warn you too.
I got Kang Hyun Min.
Haven't you seen all those articles getting removed weakly?
I'll get to the point. Whether bringing the contract with Kang Hyun Min to me, or bringing Hyun Min in front of me, bring me something firm.
Director, are you now doubting about me because of Anthony's media play?
I'm the Representative of Empire.
Representative Oh. Even if you're the Representative of Empire Production, the drama director here is me!
As you want, Director, I will bring Kang Hyun Min in front of you. Anthony, there is no one who would fall for your words, so just make sure to bring him.
By 11 AM tomorrow, before our meeting for broadcasting schedule, Bring Kang Hyun Min in front of me.
The person who brings Kang Hyun Min tomorrow will be the owner of November time slot.
The number you called is busy now.
The number you called is busy now.
PD Joo, what about Kang Hyun Min?
Representative Choi, what about Kang Hyun Min?
What?
Kang Hyun min is under water? (implying "hiding without any contact detail")
Even without Road manager Kwang Soo, he's been out of reach for 8 hours.
Out of reach?
Have you searched all possible places?
Are you sure he went under water?
If Kang Hyun Min went under water, he wouldn't go where he usually goes.
From now on, anyone who is close to Hyun Min, whether it's an actor, or a manager, find those people who are staying home today and visit all those houses.
Their homes?
Don't you know that Kang Hyun Min is a video game addict?
You're his road manager, but what did you do, not sticking to Hyun Min?
Well, I went to the rest room, but when I came back, he was gone...
I'm sorry.
Where do you think he will possibly go?
He's not at Jang Geun Seok's house.
What about your side?
He's not at Ji Sung's house, either. As Kang Hyun Min's cell phone is still turned on, I was going to ask Yoon Gye Sang's help, thinking he might answer to his call, but Gye Sang ssi isn't not answering my call.
I've already tried that method.
Cell phone....?
I've already tried that method.
Cell phone....?
Long time no see, Detective Lee.
So you want us to track down the location of Kang Hyun Min using his cell phone?
Yes, that bastard's cell phone is on.
You know, that's illegal.
I know it's illegal. That's why I'm asking you.
Hello Professor, this is Lee Go Eun.
I talked to you before about doing some background research for a drama. Actually, there is something I'm not quite clear about, Actually, there is something I'm not quite clear about, so I was wondering if I could meet with you again.
Yes, mornings are fine with me.
Of course.
Then I'll see you at the school.
Thanks.
That Kang Hyun Min bastard, maybe he's passed out somewhere drunk on purpose to annoy us.
On purpose?
Would he have taken his game console if he did it on purpose?
How do you know that he took his game console with him?
Well, actually, the thing is...
Just spit it out!
He said he'd fire me if I talked!
I'm your employer!
Now, talk!
He's in Yangpyeong.
Yangpyeong?
I got it, Detective Lee.
Producer Joo, find out who's the closest to Yangpyeong and give me a call.
Kang Hyun Min is in Yangpyeong right now.
Kang Hyun Min is still alive and well.
Hyun Min, let's go to Hollywood.
Go to Hollywood.
I'm your father.
What have you found?
Yes, looks like Writer Lee Go Eun is the closest.
What?
Lee Go Eun?
Yes, she texted me this morning that she's going to the Yicheon Moonhwa University at 9.
I'm so glad that your work is going to be made into a drama.
It's not confirmed yet, but it will be decided soon.
Well then... I don't mind; you may take the call.
I'm so sorry.
I can't take your call at this moment.
Hey, don't hang up!
I'm in the middle of an interview.
Our whole fate is in your hands.
Kang Hyun Min is in Yangpyeong, and we need him by 11 to do our drama.
You're the closest, so move right now!
Where in Yangpyeong is he at?
House number 350, Yangsoo-ri, Yangsoo-myeon, Yangpyeong-goon.
He's either in a pension or a cabin.
Get him at whatever cost!
I'm on my way, too, so just get him!
Hey!
Do you have a death wish?
!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
You've got navigation!
Take me to Yangpyeong, please!
What the heck?
Just get off!
You can charge whatever rate.
It's a dire emergency!
Please!
Representative, we're almost there.
Just hurry.
Please, hurry up.
Hey, aren't you gonna pay me?
Just wait a sec!
Hey, lady!
Representative, I'm here.
Yes.
Yes.
There is a car in the garage, so he must be inside...
Writer Lee?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Answer me, Lee Go Eun! Writer Lee? What happened?
Sweetheart?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, this is Writer Lee Go Eun.
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, I'm from the World Production.
You saw me the other day.
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun.
How did she know that I'm here?
I know you're in there.
Open the door!
Man, I've seen it already.
I saw what you were doing with that actress. I can spread the news!
I mean it!
Just open the door!
Who in their right mind would open the door when hiding?
Yee-ha!
Stop, stop!
I got you!
Hold still!
You want to die?
I've got to get dressed!
If you don't want to die, get up and lift up your hands. You, do you even know what kind of a gun that is?
Are you crazy?
Sure. I'm completely crazy.
So you should get out of here if you want to live.
I'd rather die than go out like this. Lady, I have a wife and children.
I'll give you back your money.
I don't need it.
Just spare me!
You just pay attention to the road!
Yes, Representative.
I'm on my way with Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Where?
What?
Where?
Writer Lee?
Writer Lee!
Let go! Let go of it!
I can't die like this!
Ah!
Hey!
Just turn the volume down already!
What an idiot!
Writer Lee! Lee Go Eun, what happened? !
Let go!
I said, let go!
I can't let you go!
Threatening with an umbrella isn't enough?
Let go!
If you don't come with me, we can't produce our drama!
What's that got to do with me?
Do you really think you can make me come with you?
Just listen to me for once, then I'll let you go.
What?
I know that only you can make up your mind. That you call the shots.
But just keep this in mind.
I will try my best to show how seroius, how marvelous of an actor you are.
That's why you're just a rookie. All the writers write for me, the protagonist, the very Kang Hyun Min.
Understand?
Yes, it's me.
How did it go with Kang Hyun Min?
We're bringing him with us.
Just wait for a little while.
Great! Representative, even if neither of them get Kang Hyun Min, Empire Productions has far better conditions.
That's correct.
Plus, Representative Oh is bringing Kang Hyun Min right now.
Well then, it's pretty much decided.
Then, the Monday-Tuesday slot for dramas in November shall go to the Empire Production's Elegant Revenge 2...
What are you doing?
Pardon me.
How dare you barge in? !
Get out!
My name is Kang Hyun Min.
I'll do my best.
It's not over yet.
I'll turn the tables when they least expect it.
Does living like that make you happy at all?
In this world, those with power oppress the losers.
The broadcast schedule report is not available?
Bring me the bank statement with proof of funds for the production.
If you can only produce it by covering everything up with money, I don't want that.
Why don't you step down?
I mean, I'm firing you.
Leave.
Episode 4 TheArtof War Alright, I understand. Representative,
Anthony did end up with the broadcasting slot. Kang Hyun Min is with Anthony right now. Representative Oh, I'm truly sorry.
This is so not like Hyun Min... Why would he do this? Why would he...?
Representative Choi, do you think that that is a valid excuse?
Don't ever expect to see me again.
Representative, Representative!
I didn't mean...
Representative!
Wow, seriously...
I can't win with you, Representative.
You even sent people all the way there to track me down.
This is incredible!
At any rate, why did you change your mind all of a sudden?
Why did I change my mind? From now on, I will write only for you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min. I will do my best to show in my writing what an earnest, praiseworthy actor you are.
That's why you're just a rookie. All the other writers are already doing it. Writing for the protagonist, the star, me.
Understand?
By the way, did you mean it?
What?
That you will write for me.
That you will try to prove what an awesome actor I am.
Do you really mean that?
Of course!
Then listen.
If you don't keep that promise, you'll be in big trouble.
Understand?
Yes.
I think you are mistaken.
My decision has always been the same.
I just went away to study the script.
There was no need for such a fuss.
So we were panicking for nothing.
I'm a man of my word.
How can a man ever change his word?
By the way, Representative.
About that writer, what kind of a person is she?
Does she stay true to her words? Representative, as we had originally planned, let's slate Elegant Revenge 2 for next year...
It's not over yet. Director Heo, go ahead with our preparations.
Yes. Anthony, just wait for a little bit.
I will turn the tables on you when you least expect it.
Have you lost your mind completely?
Hey, Kang Hyun Min! No matter how good-looking you are, it doesn't take much to lose your shine in this field.
If you're going to call all the shots at your whim, do you even need me?
Are you suggesting that you don't need me any more?
That's right.
To be honest, I don't need you any more. Whether I'm good-looking or not, it's thanks to me that you're making money.
Tell me, is it not?
Hyun Min, what I mean is... If that's not what you mean, just shut your mouth.
Also, since I procured this contract, I'm not giving you a single penny for it.
Got it?
Gwang Soo, let's go.
Yes.
Argh, that rascal...!
Hyung, each time I see this team, they just brighten my day.
Aigoo, she plays coy...
No matter how you slice it, when it comes to looks, our Bit Na is the best.
Yes, her looks are the best.
Bit Na, is something wrong?
I don't know, I'm just pissed.
Why, why?
Even at our last concert, they wouldn't let me say anything to the audience!
Who the heck did that? Chief Go, saying that if fans hear my voice, they will be completely put off.
That stupid Chief Go needs to learn a lesson.
What's wrong with our Bit Na's voice?
It's unique and sexy!
I don't know!
Bit Na, you wanted a new car, right?
Why?
I'll buy you one.
A nice one.
Are you serious?
I've got a big payment coming in.
Then I'll buy you one.
Oppa... I la la, I love you!
I suppose all your experience counts for something, seeing that you managed to bring in Kang Hyun Min when the Empire failed to do that.
You know, once I target an actor, I never let go.
I was wondering if you had lost your touch since you weren't doing so well for 3 years.
So, what about the script?
Working on episode 5 now.
She's done pretty well so far for someone without any publications or awards.
Yes, indeed.
However, that ends here.
Let her finish what she's working on.
Then switch to a more seasoned writer.
What?
Needless to say, the production will go live soon enough.
You can't do that with a newbie like that.
I heard that all she's got is some experience as an assistant to Writer Jeong. Is that right?
Yes, that is correct, but...
Just get a different writer.
I'm telling you this as the director of the broadcasting station.
Representative, you're back.
You're back.
What's all this?
Oh, Representative, you're back.
Why are you in such a good mood?
My mom is here.
Representative, how have you been? How have you been? Since my Go Eun wasn't coming home for nights working on the script,
I've come to make sure that you're feeding her well. Oh, Mother (of Go Eun), you should come often.
The food is so good.
Hadn't had a home-cooked meal in a long time.
Exactly, Mother.
You should have some, too, Representative.
I have eaten already.
Oh, how fortunate that I packed some extra.
Keep it in the fridge so that Representative can have it later.
Alright.
Is my daughter doing alright?
Yes.
I trust you to take good care of her.
I shall excuse myself now.
Have a safe trip back.
Mom, you're leaving already?
Yes, it's already late for me to get ready for the evening rush.
I'll see my mom to the bus station.
Writer Lee!
Yes?
I need to talk with you, why don't you say goodbye now?
Yes?
That's right.
You just stay here and talk with him. I'll get a taxi.
- Bye, and please come again.
- Thanks for the food!
What is it?
I will cut to the chase.
In addition to the contract fee, I'll give you a bonus, so 30 million won (~$30k in USD) in total.
Yes?
What does that mean...?
I would like you to step down now.
What do you mean by that?
I'm firing you.
So leave.
On what grounds?
If you want to know, I'll tell you.
I used you to get the investment, and now that I don't need you, I'm deserting you.
You asked me if I wanted to spend the rest of my life grilling mackerels.
Seemed like your mackerel business is going well, that's not a bad way of spending the rest of your life.
- You said, dreams exist to be fulfilled, not reminisced.
- I lied to convince you... You can't tell me to leave.
It's my writing!
My baby!
I'm sorry, but we've already found a new writer.
What a scum.
Yes, maybe not the world's lowest, but the lowest scum in Korea for sure.
So leave. I can't!
I won't!
I'd rather die!
I'll go to the drama department and tell them all about what a scum you are.
You would better not do that.
You'll only face the reality of how pathetic you are.
What?
It was the drama department that asked for a new writer.
Hey, you there!
Hey! Hey!
We'll have to see when the first draft....
What, what is this?
I am Writer Lee Go Eun of "The Morning of Kyeongseong."
So what?
I know that I'm being rude, but I just had to ask a question.
I just heard from the production company that they're getting a new writer.
They said that a new writer was requested by the drama department. Is that true?
Yes, it is.
I know I'm a rookie, with no publication or broadcasting experience.
However, didn't you give us the slot based on my writing?
Please, give me a chance.
Do you have any idea where you are?
Director...
You said it yourself.
That you have no publications or broadcasting experience. As the final person in charge, I'm telling you as the director of the drama department.
We can't let a rookie with no publication or broadcasting experience go out to war.
It is better off not to start a war when defeat is evident.
Then, I'm... In a nutshell, as long as you're not in the team, this war can be won.
If I've made myself clear, go now.
If... If I leave, can you guarantee that this war will be won?
What?
You probably can't.
Nobody knows for sure.
You can only excel if given an opportunity.
Even if I have to leave the production, I just wanted to say this to you.
What the... What a brat... how insolent...
She may be feisty, but she's right.
Huh, what?
Yes?
What did you just say?
No, just rambling. Representative, are you asleep?
Speak.
Writer Lee Go Eun... will she be alright?
She seemed to be in a lot of shock.
Forget about it and just sleep.
I'm trying, but I can't sleep.
What did I tell you?
To make a drama...
One must leave even if it is his own father.
Yes, so keep that in mind and sleep.
Tomorrow, we'll get the contract with Kang Hyun Min ready.
Yes.
Aunty, can you hurry up a bit?
Alright!
What are you doing?
Gwang Soo, stop.
You're here.
I told you to work out, not to show yourself off working out.
They're all dying to see me though.
All these girls have come here to see this face and this body.
I guess it doesn't hurt to sign the contract among flowers.
The terms are as we had discussed before. As soon as you sign the contract, you'll get 2 billion won in 15 days, all in one lump sum.
Gwang Soo, my stamp.
Let's break a leg!
Just deposit the money within the set time.
What do you mean?
You can't issue a certificate of broadcasting slot?
We've already signed a contract with Kang Hyun Min, and changed the writer. You can't issue a certificate of broadcasting slot? We've already signed a contract with Kang Hyun Min, and changed the writer.
Why can't you issue us a certificate when you've already given us the slot?
Who says I'm not issuing you one?
Bring me the bank statement that has the funds for this production.
What?
Not something you just type up on Word, but an actual bank book that shows the money.
Director...
You know it, too.
How many drama productions bite off more than they can chew, and end up in a wreck with insufficient funds.
That hurts the reputation of the broadcasting station as well!
Once you give me the certificate, I get the investment from Japan.
Not just a couple billion, but 10 billion!
Well then, show me the bank book with that 10 billion.
Director ...
A certificate of a broadcasting slot comes with my official seal to represent the broadcasting station.
If you want my seal, show me the money first.
We have to deposit the 2 billion for Kang Hyun Min, too. What now?
If he doesn't get that 2 billion, he'll go with someone else for sure.
Then, the whole drama is..
What if we explained our situation to the Japanese sponsor?
I've already contacted the person in charge, it's the same story.
An official document of the broadcasting schedule.
What the S Broadcasting Director wants is not bank books.
Here, take a shot.
- Cheers - Thanks for your hard work.
I heard that they're switching the writer for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
That Lee Go Eun, who wrote the synopsis, came to the Director and made a scene, I heard.
But it's a new genre we've not done before.
How much better could an experienced writer be?
In the end, it is up to the production skills of Representative Kim of the World Production.
And we all know that recently, many production companies start shooting, then run out of money, and end up not paying the actors and the filming crew.
We've seen so many cases like that.
If you're giving the slot to Representative Kim, it would be good to make sure about the funding situation.
I know, I already told Anthony about securing the funds.
You have a visitor.
Good evening.
Hey, Representative Kim!
What brings you here?
I came here to get dinner, and I heard that you were here, so I've come to say hi.
Oh, I see. Come in, come in.
Yes.
I was thinking about what you said earlier today, Director.
And I admit that I was in the wrong.
As you had requested, I will bring you a bank book showing the funds and also draw up a budget plan.
Of course, that you should.
Here, have a drink.
Huh?
What are you doing outside?
I have a favor to ask, Director.
A favor?
I heard that you play golf in Nonhyun-dong lately... Give me the combination of your locker, and I'll prepare something for you by tomorrow.
Representative Kim...
It's just a token of my appreciation.
Please take it.
Appreciation for what?
The certificate of broadcasting slot.
Hey, Anthony, are you still doing this crap?
What about you, Director?
What? Last year, on March 24 and September 13, KJ Production sent you some token appreciations.
Watch your words.
I thought they were just rumors.
That's right. Totally senseless rumors.
Got it?
Yes, I'm sure.
Alright.
Oh, would you check if my car is parked ok outside?
It's black, and the number is 8911.
Yes, I shall, Director.
Are you still doing things this way?
What... do you mean?
I guess people never change.
Since I had a drink, I'll just say one thing as a man.
Representative Kim, I... hate you. (dropping the honorifics)
I especially hate those dirty, shameless ways of darkness of how you do your business.
Yes, those dirty, shameless ways of darkness are exactly how I've been doing my business, and I'll continue to do so.
Now, think about it.
How much longer do you think you'll be in the drama department, Chief Producer Nam?
The way I see it, with all the promotions, 5 years at best?
Do you even have a plan for your retirement?
That's why you're such a low jerk, bastard.
Thank you.
I'm paying for my own drinks.
Have you looked into the things I asked you about?
Oh, that?
I've found a few after some internal investigation.
Just as I told you, right?
What would you like me to do?
Kill him.
So that he'll never come near this field...
Ajumma, another bottle of soju.
- Here, another bottle.
- Thanks.
- Aunty, we'd like another grilled mackerel.
- Yes. Yes, coming!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Because they liked my script so much, I'm on vacation.
Well then, hurry up and grill some mackerels.
Can't you see how busy we are?
Yes, Madame Kang .(Madame Tenacity)
The money?
It will be withdrawn from the bank in 30 minutes.
Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong.
Director Moon's locker number and combination.
8911?
8911... No, put it in your mouth and swallow it.
What? We can't leave any trace behind unless they cut our guts open.
Get the money and deliver it right away.
I'll go get the certificate of broadcasting slot.
Yes, I got it.
Where did they all go with the door open?
Writer Lee ...
I just came to get my stuff...
What is that? Yes? Oh, it's nothing.
Well, you know, Miss Writer, it is inevitable for the production to start, so... it just happens this way.
I guess "The Morning of Kyeongseong" will be the inaugural work of World Production.
Yes.
Break a leg.
Thank you.
And the writer?
Still in search for a decent experienced one.
Good.
Alright, you may leave.
Well, have a good day. One of my assistants just stopped by the Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong, and says that it looks really nice, perhaps they've renovated the interior.
You should go check it out.
So, has the funding issue been resolved?
Yes, he got the money from a Japanese sponsor.
There's nothing to worry.
Congratulations.
Wow, Representative Kim has done it in the end!
How impressive.
Right?
In that dirty way.
It's all thanks to your concerns.
Do you know how many hard-working professionals in this field fall in despair because of people like you?
Yes, I'm well aware of them.
I'm one of those professionals in this field as well.
Excuse me.
Yes, Director.
Hey, you bastard.
Is this a joke?
What?
What are you talking about?
How dare you make a fool of me?
That's not possible.
Why would the money be missing?
Hello, hello!
Direc...... Producer Joo, what happened?
Did you make the delivery?
Well,thatis ...
Representative...
Hurry up and tell me!
Writer Lee Go Eun has hid the money bag, so I couldn't even leave the office.
What?
Representative.
Where did you put it? You were acting as though everything will go smoothly if I wasn't on the team, but in reality, you had to use such dirty means!
It doesn't matter.
Why doesn't it matter?
I didn't leave just so you could do this!
You left on your own. Just give it up.
Where is that money? The money is for producing the drama, not for lobbying with bribes like that.
You don't know anything, stay out of it.
Then explain it then.
There's no time for that.
Just tell me, where is that money?
I won't say a word until you convince me completely.
Without that money, this drama won't happen.
Are you happy now? Your writing will not be broadcast. If you have to cover everything up with money to produce it,
I don't need it.
I'm the original writer,
FORGET ABOUT IT THEN.
Producer Joo.
Yes.
When, and how did she hide it? While I was away for a sec, at least she didn't leave this place. Umm, Representative, the golf putting range closes in 30 minutes.
Miss Writer, Representative isn't doing this because he wants to.
Don't just stand there like that, and say something!
Won't you?
Move.
Why should I move?
I said move!
Aren't you getting out of the way? You keep ignoring me, you'd better get a lawyer. Even if you get the production going with bribes,
I will make sure that it doesn't get aired!
Sue all you want.
You'll be watching my drama as you wait for the proceeding.
Open it!
Open it!
Hey!
Man, I keep missing the ball! It's not just the balls I'm missing. My arms and legs feel like they're not mine.
Yes, it's me, Director.
There was a slight accident on our part, but I'm just calling you now to tell you that I delivered it myself.
Yes, sorry.
Yes.
You've still got something to say?
You!
You know what?
What?
What an eeevil (slurred speech as she's drunk) nasty, dirty, jerk you are?
Do you know what a cold-blooded, cruel, infernal scum you are?
You called me to ask me that?
Sure, I'll give you my answer.
I am aware of it. More than anybody in the world. Living like that, are you happy?
Living stupidly like you, how is that?
What about you living so stupidly, being trampled and torn apart?
I am not unhappy.
Because, despite the world being dirty like you, I am living.
Your kind doesn't understand the world.
The world has been very dirty from the beginning. By fair means or foul, emerging victorious through force, and dominating the losers is the world.
I am going to triumph in this filthy world.
You are going to fall.
There's something else you don't know.
In my mind now, to be living here is hell.
Hyung, you're not coming back tonight?
Probably not.
Hyung, it's a guest.
Guest?
Apologies for coming so late at night.
I don't know if you've heard but I won't be able to keep my promise.
I'm really thankful that you liked my work, but for unavoidable circumstances, I had to quit.
What?
So are they changing the writer?
You got fired then.
Yes.
I got fired. I got fired because I don't have any experience.
At any rate, although I won't be working on it any more, the script still means a lot to me.
Please, treat that script like a child that has lost its mother until the very end and fulfill your role with affection.
So?
Did you come to me to get you unfired?
No, I didn't come for that at all.
I just ...
But, what do you mean by "no?" You tried everywhere else, it didn't work, so you've come here, pretending to be nice, asking me to help you, right? asking me to help you, right?
No, I'm not like that.
It's no use.
Come to think of it, I was a bit nervous about the writer being a rookie.
This is for the best.
Don't get your heart broken over this. It's the nature of this field.
That's not it!
What the heck?
I put my everything at stake for my "The Morning of Kyeongseong."
Though I'm leaving, I want you all to take it seriously with affection.
Is that so hard, you idiots?
! Is she crazy?
What are you doing?
Drag her out of here.
Yes. Leave.
You morons!
- You're so drunk.
- It's mine!
- What's yours?
- Just go!
- Let go of me!
You can't just get drunk and barge in like that. Living like that, does it make you happy?
Screenwriter: Lee Go Eun
Hey, Unni!
Hey, watch your driving!
That was close.
Wow, you're pretty.
- Noonim, how old are you?
- How old are you?
- Unni, you see, we're hungry...
- Aiiiiiish.... Hey, get out all you've got. Hey, get out all you've got.
Stop staring like that and give us your money!
Ah well, can't be helped.
Good evening, police officer. Good evening, police officer.
I'm on the backstreet by Hyundai Villa in Cheongdam-dong.
Three drunk highschoolers are trying to do something to another drunk woman.
Oh, I'm just a civilian citizen.
One that pays a lot of taxes.
Please dispatch someone here quick. Thanks!
Well...
I'm... really in a bad mood tonight...
So.. could you guys just... leave me alone?
Wow, did I just hear that right?
Hey, do you want to die?
You'd better let go of me.
Honestly ...
What is she?
You highschool brats!
Aren't you supposed to be studying?
Dang, I should have avoided her eyes.
At any rate, is she really a writer?
She's like a gangster!
How scary.
Jesus Christ!
Yes?
Well, do you know Lee Go Eun?
So if I do?
This is Gangnam Police Department. I understand that she was drunk, but what kind of a lady beats up three kids like that by herself?
She passed out once she got here, and we didn't know who to contact.
We checked her recent call history, and saw that she had made several calls to you.
At any rate, what is your relationship to her?
She put you down as "Youndeungpo Crazy Dog" on her contacts list.
So I got curious.
Three million won (~$3k USD) for a settlement isn't too bad.
Is it ok if she spends the night here?
Huh?
Umm..
Hey Hey! Today, on the Olympic Expressway in Seoul, a drunk truck driver crashed his truck and killed one person.
At the time of the accident, the blood alcohol content of truck driver Kim had exceeded the level of 0.1%, which means his license will be suspended.
The police are still investigating the exact circumstances of the accident, and plan to charge truck driver Kim with DUI.
On another note, early this morning, the director of the drama department of a certain broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested without a warrant.
It has been announced that Moon is suspected of charges of accepting bribes related to privileges associated with drama broadcasting slots.
The police announced that they will investigate the matters further and will seek strict corrective measures.
Additional investigations are still going on.
This news was brought to you by MBS, Kim So Yeon.
Does seeing someone get arrested give you back some senses?
Huh?
You should thank the person who paid your settlement money. You may go.
Settlement money?
Who? That "Youngdeungpo Crazy Dog" took care of everything.
...drama department of a certain broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested without a warrant.
...announced that he is suspected of accepting bribes privileges associated with broadcasting slots....
Thanks for the good news, Sunbaenim.
It's rather surprising that the culprit behind all this is not on the list.
We just got the search warrant, so we're going through all his office, house, and car.
One of those places should have it.
There's one more place to check.
One more place?
A personal locker at Ohhyung Golf Course in Nonhyun-dong.
Personal locker?
It is a preferred venue for one of the bribe donors.
Yes.
Keep up with your good work.
You've caused Director Moon to fall in order to get to Anthony? Director Moon will probably confess everything anyway, but once the money bag is found, that's the moment of doom for Anthony.
Then, that broadcasting slot goes back to null.
Schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning.
Yes. Yes.
I like the news today.
Yes.
I understand.
The search warrant is out.
As soon as we get there, crack the door open and get the evidence right away.
Ah, aish.
Get the tools!
This way!
There's a guy that's just leaving the building.
Get him! Yes, I understand.
This morning, the director of the drama department of a broadcasting station, Moon, was arrested.
Moon is suspected of charges of receiving bribes for privileges regarding broadcasting slots.
Isn't he from the broadcasting station for your drama?
Is your drama going to be ok when someone big like him gets arrested?
I think it'll be... ok.
Seriously.
He should have just eaten grilled mackerels instead of stuffing his guts with other people's money.
It's me, Producer Joo. I just saw the news, is that money ok?
Oh, it was close.
Fortunately, Representative saw the news and took immediate action, so it's all safe.
It was really close. We were so lucky.
Then, there's no problem with the drama?
Well, I'm not sure, for the moment...
Hello.
Miss Writer, I'm sorry, but I have to go to a meeting now.
If anything changes or gets decided, I'll contact you.
Now that the director has been arrested, Empire will try to shake up the broadcasting schedule.
How are things at Empire?
They submitted the synopsis of "Elegant Revenge 2" of Writer Jeong yesterday through Assistant Director Kim.
I heard that the synopsis is 10 pages long.
You can get a slot even without a synopsis, and this is "Elegant Revenge 2."
What is Writer Jeong Hong Joo doing?
Working on the script for the first two episodes.
Notify me as soon as the first drafts are done.
Who are the potential candidates for the next director of S Broadcasting? Based on the accomplishments from last year and the first half of this year, Assistant Director Park is most likely.
Have you eaten yet?
He started out as an open recruit, and has the reputation of being a nice person with good skills among the producers, so many directors support him.
However, based on school ties, some predict that Assistant Director Kim, who went to the same school as the president of S Broadcasting, will be the one.
Also, Assistant Director Kim's wife is known for her influence.
She even moved their family residence so that their children would go to the same school as the president's.
That says a lot.
Assistant Director Kim....
It was Empire's Oh Jin Wan that caused the fall of Director Moon.
What?
Yesterday, the synopsis of Writer Jeong was given to A.D. Kim, and Director Moon was arrested this morning.
To plan an arrest without a warrant the very day of today... means that they predicted that we'd bribe Director Moon.
You mean, the person who reported Director Moon to the authorities is...
He wanted to get me arrested.
The decision of choosing a new director is up to the president.
The most likely candidate is A.D. Kim.
Notify me as soon as S Broadcasting makes the announcement of the personnel changes tomorrow.
Yes.
You all go home.
Yes.
The personnel changes have been announced.
[Announcements from the Human Resources Department]
- What is this?
- What does this mean?
The director is coming!
Good morning.
Well done.
Let me count on your assistance.
I expect much guidance from you all.
Let's take our seats.
We would like to turn this unfortunate event around and use it as a trigger to introduce a revolutionary change in the drama department of S Broadcasting.
And I believe that the priority is to ensure that we produce high quality dramas, work with actors loved by the public, and keep the production environment clean and transparent.
Consequently, the broadcasting schedule for November determined by the previous director is going to be totally revamped.
That is all.
I don't accept congratulatory messages.
I know how you hate me the most. I've been doing business using the dirty, shameless ways of darkness that you hate so much, and I know how you think of me as a morally devoid person.
However, Director, please give me this one chance.
I beg of you.
Just one chance?
However, that one chance might allow someone like you to control this whole field of dramas.
I've decided against it.
I won't change my mind.
Please leave.
- What's going to happen to our slot?
Hurry! That position should have been yours, Assistant Director.
Show him who's really in power in this department.
You're not my superior!
I will get my work published and proudly present my name, Lee Go Eun on the script.
We'll reinstate Writer Lee Go Eun.
No one would write "The Morning of Kyeongseong" better than her.
It's not over yet!
Why don't you just cancel your contract?
- I'll help you with that.
- This is all for our drama.
You mean, your drama. The weapon with which Anthony, King of Dramas, will take back his realm.
I'll wait for you.
Just don't take too long to return.
Episode 6 The Division in front of Enemies This is your writing contract. Well, then... sign here.
Leave now. Move! - Get out of my way!
- What are you guys doing? Let go. I said to MOVE!
No, Lee Go Eun!
-What is this? !
DRAG HIM OUT OF HERE!
YOU CAN'T SIGN!
Fine, I'll give you what you want.
I will leave its genre the same as the current one, noir.
And without the present day's scene, I will keep the first episode same as your draft!
Writer, it's a lie.
Just go ahead and sign.
WHAT'S THIS?
DRAG HIM OUT OF HERE!
Wait just a minute!
Go on.
I'll take out the supervisor too.
Writer Lee, it isn't once or twice that he's fooled you!
Because he's desperate, he's lying to get what he wants.
No, that's not the case. You know how Anthony works, it's all the same as three years ago!
NO, LEE GO EUN! You'd better be prepared for the law suit, because I'll never lose it to you.
Don't trouble yourself about it.
You made a good decision.
Yes.
We should go eat.
There is a really great Japanese restaurant nearby.
Next time. Today I have another engagement.
Ah, yes. If you were thinking of signing from the start, what was your reason for calling me?
Do you know what you just did?
You just tore my drama, no, my life to pieces.
Didn't know I was such an important person.
What?
! Why not?
You get to do whatever you want to do but I can't do what I want to do?
That's why I said we'd do without the melodrama as a noir, without a supervisor, whatever you wanted!
Exactly, so fulfill all those promises as you said.
What does that mean?
Director, you are amazing.
In the end, you really defeated Anthony.
What did I say.
The one who laughs in the end is the winner.
Director, what's the matter?
What?
What did you just say?
I didn't sign.
LEE GO EUN!
Next time... So the reason you came here, was to get what you want under the pretext of signing?
Yes, so make sure you definitely keep your promises.
Since I have it recorded here.
Geez, where did you learn to do that?
Who do you think? From you, Representative.
What?
Why are you so surprised?
Like an amateur...
I heard this is what they usually do in the field.
Do you have confidence you can do it?
I'm asking if you can take responsibility for your decision.
What are you trying to say? If in November we were to completely fail, the sun will shine as if nothing's happened.
But you and I will be finished. I know, that it's not just you and I, but all the people involved in this work.
We will either succeed or fail solely on my decision.
That's why I can't give up.
We will win.
Are you sure you can win?
I mean, if you're sure what's the chance (%) of winning?
You've always told me, "Believe in me."
This time, Representative, it's your turn to believe in me.
What is this?
This is the key for that writing space you wanted.
My own writing place?
So this is something you prepared?
You thought I'd make you write in that tiny place forever?
We MUST win this war.
That rascal.
Here.
Over this way.
Over this way.
Did anyone see a cutter knifer here?
What?
On that brick pillar, you shouldn't paint with white!
Not that one, but over there, please paint there.
Everyone, enjoy your meal.
Did you know?
That the Representative picked this place?
Yes.
You already knew?
Yes.
- So only I didn't know?
! I found the place.
Really?
Deposit is 5 million won ($5,000) and monthly rent fee is 300,000 won ($300). Deposit is 5 million won ($5,000) and monthly rent fee is 300,000 won ($300).
Where should we put this?
Just put it anywhere over here.
Cheers.
-Cheers!
Finally, Writer Lee gets her own writing space!
It was with everyone's help.
To be honest, I never imagined Director would ever get you your own place! Though Director seems like a vicious man from the outside, he's not like that on the inside.
But hyung, what kind of Director will come?
Who knows?
That... is not going to be easy.
Why?
I think Director Kim Hyun Min would be good for "Morning in Kyeongseong".
We've done other works together, too.
You see, Director Kim is, uh.... difficult to get, it seems he's already working on another piece.
Then what about Director Jeong?
Ah Director Jeong!
..will also be difficult.
Difficult?
Uh, that's because...
Why?
Do you possibly have another director in mind?
No, it's not like that!
Just wait a little longer, we're doing our best to convince...
Convince?
There was a meeting of the regular PDs that caused a problem with assigning a director for the drama.
I will never work with that jerk, Anthony.
When he was kicked out of this field, everybody applauded in celebration!
I still get upset whenever I think about the way he humiliated me! And now, you expect me to work with him?
Yes, I understand your point. But what's important is that this "Morning of Kyeongseong" is not just Anthony Kim's drama, but a drama of our S Broadcasting. Do you understand?
You're the one who'd been insisting, Director, that the broadcasting stations should not work with scum like him!
It's not like he's the representative of Empire, he's just a representative of a rookie third-rate...
Third rate? !
Director Kim, your "Paradise Lost" had hit the rating of 35.9%.
Also, Director Jeong and Director Yoon, you all had big hits after working with me and became representative directors of S Broadcasting.
How can you, after achieving your current fame thanks to me, call me a third-rate producer?
! You call that fame?
It was humiliation!
You were ruling the shooting sites as if you were the director.
I won't take that again.
I took action only because you weren't a good leader!
What?
Are you talking down to me?
What do you think you are doing?
This is a statement of the position of the regular PDs. We'd like to make it clear to you that every one of us, PDs of S Broadcasting,
Statement of refusal to work refuses to direct Anthony's production, "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Let's get out of here. You normally persist with your own decisions, why are you backing down this time?
Are you trying to get back at me?
Get back at you?
Get back at me for having my way with the slot.
Representative Kim...
Do you judge all the people of the world by your own standards alone?
Just answer my question. I'm the director of the drama department. Regardless of whether I like the slot decision or not, once it has been decided,
I have also put my life on the line for this drama.
Happy now?
Oh, yeah... and also...
Does it ever occur to you that your twisted ways of doing business cost you the trust of our PD's?
I trust viewership ratings more than people.
Also, I'm one of.. no, more than anyone, have put my life on the line for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
If we can't find one internally, then...
I'll bring a seasoned veteran director from outside.
A seasoned veteran?
Like who?
I think the situation will be the same outside, too.
This morning I saw this coming and I thought of someone.
Director Goo?
Yeah.
If the internal directors refuse to work with us, why not work with freelancers like Director Goo?
He hasn't done anything in a while, but he is a tried and true veteran.
He was the best at one point, with four dramas that had over 30% in viewership rating...
But... he's a goner now.
Goner?
Five years ago, when he left the field, he retired completely and lives out in the countryside.
Retired?
Why?
I don't know the specifics, but... there are rumors that suggest that he's become an alcoholic.
Well...
I've also heard that he's become a dog seller in some remote place.
A dog seller?
No way.
Director Goo Young Mok is a serious alcoholic who can't even function as a person.
No way he can direct again.
No, that's something you have to create.
Also, wasn't it you who had produced the last drama of Director Goo?
You should know very well what a great director he is, then.
Listen to me.
Given our current situation, the best person for the job of directing "Morning of Kyeongseong" is Director Goo Young Mok.
No one else will do. We've asked other external directors whose schedules are compatible, but they all said no.
It takes a dog to recognize a dog.
Director...
Long time, no see 'Cheongdamdong's Crazy Dog.'
I don't live in Cheongdamdong any more.
A dog is a dog no matter where he lives.
Come inside.
What brings you all the way here?
Can't just be to have a drink with me.
I want you to come with me to Seoul.
Seoul?
That's a real dog mess there.
What are you scheming?
I want you to direct a drama.
Drama?
Why?
Is there no one willing to direct for you?
After not seeing you for awhile, you're still making me laugh.
Stop wasting your effort and go back.
I was done directing dramas 5 years ago.
That's when my life ended, too.
First day of broadcasting is November 5th, 20 episodes, period piece.
My contact information is included, so give me a call after you read it.
Crazy bast***.
You're ruining my drink, get lost!
You've been drinking for 5 years, haven't you had enough?
You're the one that had said, the place for me to breathe and to stop breathing is the shooting site.
There's not much time.
You have to give me a decision within 3 days.
Get out!
Before I stick the dogs on you!
Representative Oh.
Yes, Chairman.
Explain it to me.
I don't know what you mean... The Japanese investor, the broadcasting slot!
How much longer are you going to let Anthony have his way like that?
I'm sorry.
A hound that had been loyal to its master bites the master.
That guy... what should we do about him?
We must catch him.
No...
Catch him and kill him.
Before he finishes sharpening his fangs in preparation of revenge.
If left alone, he's going to attack me with those fangs.
I understand.
You'd better make sure that you do it right this time.
There are so many hounds out there to replace you.
Let's go.
It's been awhile.
Yes. Yes.
Once more... I'll need your help.
When do you have time?
Hello everyone!
Our guest today is South Korea's most popular, handsome guy, the prince in the drama industry. The top star, everyone who is it?
KANG HYUN MIN!
Korea's best top star, Kang Hyun Min, come on out!
Wow, seriously, your popularity is as high as the sky, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Oh, thank you.
Everybody, as you see Kang Hyun Min in person, how do you feel?
He's so hot!
- He's so handsome!
They say you are very good looking.
Thank you.
When I see you here, seriously, the word "sculpture-like handsome guy" used to describe you isn't exaggerated.
Oh, you overpraised me.
Thank you.
Wow, you're even humble.
Indeed, you're the top actor.
Yes, yes, yes.
How do you feel about all these people coming out to see you ?
Oh, well, of course, I'm very thankful.
Is that so?
Yes, I'm so grateful.
People who love Kang Hyun Min, scream!
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Thank you.
Yes, yes.
Kang Hyun Min ssi, I don't think we can do an interview here!
I agree.
Let's go inside and do the interview.
Shall we?
Because, in this crowd... I just don't think it's possible.
I understand.
Okay, everyone!
We'll be going in now.
See you guys later!
Look outside.
All your loving fans are still outside.
Your popularity is incredible!
Thank you.
So, I heard you're shooting a new drama.
Yes.
The drama's called, 'Morning of Kyeongseong' and I am playing the role as 'Kim Woo Jin.'
'Morning of Kyeongseong?
' Wow, the title's very impressive.
So, is there a reason why you chose this drama over others?
Well, let's see...
Reading the script made my whole body shudder.
It gave you the shudders?
I thought this was one drama I should never pass on.
I see... Reading the script gave you the chills.
I'm really looking forward to seeing this drama.
But, on another note...
Yes?
There's a rumor that you're being paid the most among all actors in the country.
That's right isn't it?
That... is not true. When I select a drama
I do not ever take into account how much I get paid.
I leave all that to my manager so, in truth, I have no idea how much I make.
A drama is a work of art.
I believe that excessive thought of money... can be fatal to an actor.
Wow, 'excessive thought of money can be fatal to an actor?
' You are truly a great actor....
What's wrong?
No matter how much I think about it, I'm still angry.
Does it even make sense that a drama is not made melo?
This drama seems better that it's not melo.
Darling, do you think I like melo dramas?
Melo is money... Money!
It has to be melo so people love the drama, and that's exactly how I get CF offers!
Ah, that's right, the director can change that.
The director can change it towards a more melo drama.
What?
Who's our film director, Kwang Soo?
Who knows?
Has it not been decided yet?
Call Anthony and find out.
Right now.
Who is it?
Who are you dating?
It's...
- It's...
- Who?
!
You 'One Night' viewers. (This show)
Hello?
You bastard!
Director Goo?
Yes, you piece of trash.
Did you read the script?
Shut up, you dog!
Please calm down... No matter how much I think about it, I'm too pissed off to calm down.
Why did you just bring me such an impressive script now!
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
You rotton excuse of a human being.
Yes, I'm listening.
Where are you right now? I'll be there as soon as the sun's up tomorrow, so you all better be prepared!
What is going on that we're meeting so early?
I'm a bit worried...
Good morning!
Now, everyone say hello to...
Director Goo Young Mok, who will be directing 'Morning of Kyeongseong.'
It's nice to meet you gentlemen.
I am Goo Young Mok.
What are you doing not applauding?
Who's that dummy over there?
Oh, I'm a new script writer, but not a dummy, Director...
My name is Lee Go Eun.
Oh?
So you're Lee Go Eun.
You also look like a something' alright.
I look forward to working with you!
Welcome to the team, Director!
Let's all do well.
Welcome!
Hello, Director!
Oh, it's been too long.
Hello, Director!
Nice to see you again!
Oh!
Sunbae-nim!
Hello, Sunbae-nim!
Oh, how long has it been?
Have you guys been well?
Yes, yes. Are you excited now that we're in some real chaos,
Crazy Dog?
Could you please not call me 'Crazy Dog' anymore?
Drop the pretense, you punk.
Wow, how long has it been?
Why are you so excited?
This is it, isn't it?
Stop your fussing, you punk.
They're here.
Aigo. Director!
Welcome back, Director!
It's been a very long time!
So you're the broadcasting director dog now?
Ah, yes.
You're still the same, Director Goo.
Speaking of which, you're still here?
Ah, Director... Please show me your enthusiasm, just like you did when I first entered the company.
Please take good care of the show.
Ask that to the rating.
Both you and I will die or live depending on that number.
It's this way.
This is the place.
Writer Lee?
Nice to see you!
Hello, Director!
Hello!
Director of Photography!
Wow, how long has it been!
?
This is the lighting manager.
Wow... how long has it been?
This is the director of photography.
This set is impressive!
Do you think...
Director Goo won't have problems?
There has to be problems.
Pardon?
We supported Anthony to get his time slot and we now have some power... Now, we must take Director Nam down. Wouldn't it be easy to take Director Nam down, if his first drama, as the Broadcasting Director, fails?
How do you feel?
I'm so excited!
It makes my heart flutter that my own script will be made into a real drama!
Keep that up with your script, too.
Yes, Director.
We should have dinner together with the team.
I'll make a reservation at a restaurant near the company.
I'm already meeting someone tonight.
Director Goo is a charming person.
Yes, yes he is.
But don't like him too much.
There's no such thing as a conflictless drama, but there's no such thing as a conflictless set either.
Aigo, Director!
How do you do, Director?
I'm Kang Hyun Min.
I see, you're Hyun Min.
Rascal, you are indeed handsome.
Please make me look good on camera, too.
Okay.
Sit down, sit down.
I can't tell you how glad we are that you are here, Director.
I would especially like to talk to you about the genre of Noir regarding this drama.
What are your thoughts on the genre?
That's what I like about it.
The fact that it is a fresh genre without the cheesy melancholy.
That's why it really suited me.
That's right.
You're even good at selecting a good project... I see why you've become such a star, Hyun Min.
Yes. But even though I think that it's okay, in general wouldn't it be good to have a little bit of melo [drama] in it?
Don't pay any attention to that Anthony-like nonsense!
No, no, I don't.
Especially the ending scene of episode 1... is so full of the genre, it's awesome!
Exactly!
Starting with the ending of episode 1, we're going to overwhelm the screen! Hyun Min, your sharp eyes and your sculptured body will be captured by 12 cameras, Action!
Explode!
Jump into the sea!
Flames of fire everywhere. Splashes of water can be heard as you swim across the tall waves.
Close in on the sharp eyes of Kim Jin Woo, and then...
CUT! Director, this is amazing!
The best scene ever in Korean drama history!
What's even more impressive is that we're doing it for real without computer graphics.
Gwang Soo!
By the way, you do know how to swim, right?
Of course. I've been training just in case.
Do you know how to swim in the sea?
Excuse me? The sea? Even though the weather is not ideal, it's not winter yet, so the sea should be okay.
You can do it, right?
Eh?
Yes.
Very good.
We should do this as we had originally planned, - Yes.
and if we need more, we can talk later as they come up.
- Yes.
You go and show him.
What?
You should look at this.
Director Goo said to redo the budget for episode 1 according to this...
Where is Director Goo now? Five years is a long time, but "Morning of Kyeongseong" has given me hope out of that despair. I, Goo Young Mok, will treat it as if it were my last drama, and leave my old, idle ways of life and pathetic attitude behind.
I will put my very best into this project! Therefore, this project will be shot at a huge scale to match the quality it deserves, and we have a long, arduous journey ahead of us.
Everybody, are you ready?
!
Yes!
Though it's not alcohol, let's have a toast.
For "Morning of Kyeongseong!"
Cheers!
Oh, Representative Kim, good to see you.
Have a seat. Before that, let's talk outside.
What?
What do you want to say?
What is this?
What about this?
You're asking why? Twelve cameras, a helicopter, 1,200 extras, the costs for actors, costumes, and food for filming for 5 days, and even an exploding cruise!
You want to spend over a 1 billion won (~$1million) for just the last 5 minutes of episode 1, are you for real?
Yeah, and so?
What about it?
There's no way we can do that.
Can't do it?
Yes, can't do it.
I want to pour every last drop of my passion into this, why can't we do it?
! Why should I burn my money to fuel your passion, Director?
This is the most important scene of this drama! Even so, over a billion won for just 5 minutes is too much. I'm preparing a team that can work with a reasonable budget, so work something out with them.
And if I can't do that?
Then I will be forced to use my last resort.
What's that?
You're saying you will fire me?
If you won't change your mind, then, yes, I'll fire you.
Don't play around.
You may be the one who brought me on board, but you can't kick me off so easily.
That sounds fun.
Oh it would be very fun.
Really, what's your personal problem?
If people don't do what you want, you threaten to fire them.
If you don't know, but out since it's not your concern.
Representative!
Find another director.
I already told you.
There is no one else.
Find one!
Even if you have to search the whole country, or the whole world!
If there isn't anyone, create someone!
Yes, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Where?
Has it been 3 years? Enough with the formalities, you're the representative of the Empire Production.
But who is it this time?
The one you want to teach a lesson?
It's someone you also know very well.
If it's someone I know very well, who is it?
Kang Hyun Min.
Actor Kang Hyun Min?
I'm counting on your help.
Just like when you helped with bringing down Anthony with the media reports 3 years ago.
Just like bringing down Anthony 3 years ago, huh?
Anyhow, why is Kang Hyun Min your target?
If I can't cut off the head of the enemy, I shall cut off his hand that wields the sword.
Me, go in the sea?
Even in the winter?
Does this make any sense?
What kind of a director is he?
He needs to learn to respect his actors.
What if, while shooting the ending of episode 1, something goes wrong like that?
What about the rest of the drama? I'm irreplaceable for this whole business!
Writer, are you listening to what I'm saying?
Well, can't you just go along and do it?
No way! They want to dunk me, Kang Hyun Min, the superstar, into the cold winter sea!
Just do it?
Do you even know what the sea temperature is today?
I even looked it up.
It's 6ºC (43ºF)!
Six degrees! I can't do this.
No, I choose not to!
You call yourself an actor, but the reason why you won't do it is because it's cold?
Yes, it's because it's cold!
I can tolerate a lot of things, but not cold!
Never!
Suck it up!
I refuse to suck it up.
Cut out that ending scene of episode 1.
What's that?
Or fix it so I won't have to swim.
I've got plenty of other mind-wrecking things right now, do you have to add to that, Kang Hyun Min?
You promised.
That you would write for me.
How is that promise related to this issue?
No matter what, I won't go in the sea. Either, talk Director Goo out of it, or change the script.
I'm leaving.
You're implying you'll fire me?
If you don't change your mind, then, yes, I'll fire you.
What is this?
This is the budget list of episode 1 based on the wishes of Director Goo.
And so?
So? !
It can't be produced this way!
I'm going to change the director.
Have you tried reasoning?
He's very stubborn.
Isn't persuasion one of the skills of a producer?
Right? If persuasion doesn't work, then you should increase the budget.
So you're a person without skill, Producer Kim.
In such a circumstance, don't we have to change the producer instead of changing the director?
Director!
Representative Kim...
Right now all the directors said that they can't shoot a drama with you.
In such a case, what do you think will be our choice as a broadcasting station? Representative Kim, if you have no skills, quit.
We will sign a contract with Director Goo directly and make this drama on our own.
This person...
Writer Lee...
Didn't Director Goo contact you perhaps?
He didn't.
And the Representative?
Well, that... he went to the broadcasting station.
It seems like he'll tell them that he's going to fire Director Goo.
Writer Lee...
Taxi!
You can come in.
You were looking for me?
Ah, yes.
Yes, Director Nam.
About "Morning of Kyeongseong"... There is a possibility that we will be producing it ourselves, so please make preparations for that.
But...
In-house production ?
Yes.
Yes?
Director, someone is here to see you.
Okay.
Oh, Writer Lee.
How... is the script-writing going well?
Yes.
As you may know, there is a bit of a problem between Director Goo and Representative Kim.
But you just need to focus on writing, Writer Lee.
I came because I heard that our Representative was here.
Yes. You'll have heard of it, our Representative and Director Goo, neither of them are willing to give way.
It would be good if you could mediate between them.
Please do us the favour. Well, I gave a final notice to Representative Kim and since you will find it out soon, I'll tell you what's going on.
If Producer Kim can't clear up this situation, we have no choice but to produce "Morning of Kyeongseong" ourselves at SBC.
In-house production?
Yes, in-house production.
So, that means World Production will be excluded from the production team.
Do you really... have to go this far?
Ah, nothing about your role will change, so please don't worry too much.
I'm sorry, but I think producing the drama through World Production is the right choice.
But, why are you on Representative Kim's side?
Are you trying to repay him for reinstating you as the writer?
Huh?
Representative Kim reinstated me...?
What are you going to do now?
I heard it from the director himself.
He said if it's not Director Goo they are going for in-house production.
It's not for you to interfere.
So are you going to pull out of the production?
That's not for you to worry about either.
I'm asking because I'm curious how you're feeling.
You fired people whom you don't like, but now you're in the other side's situation.
So I'm wondering how you feel, probably it f***ing sucks.
It feels dirty and pathetic, right?
That's why people hate you.
Don't concern yourself.
That's why there is no one left at your side.
I don't need those bastards.
But you said you wanted to make a successful comeback.
To make that success last long, you must not lose people. You don't have any power now, not like when you were in Empire.
What, are the things I said not correct?
Am I not correct? That's right. Making this drama successful and taking the reward from it for my comeback is the purpose of all of these.
And avenging on those people who took away my position and trampled on my power is the reason.
Are they all like that?
People born and raised in wealthy homes and priviledged environments?
Are they all like you?
Why can't you just accept the reality of having fallen to the ground?
Is resenting the world your only option?
So? Did I do anything wrong? You, why on earth did you end up making dramas?
There's no such nonsense as a reason.
You... why on earth did you end up making dramas?
You jerk, what did you say!
?
If you call me a fatherless son of a b... once more and you keep prattling on about my mother not being able to see, I'll kill you!
What kind of kid is taught that?
Since you're blind, I can't tell you to look (at my son's face).
What are you going to do about my son's face?
!
I am sorry.
It's my fault, because I'm so lacking.
Why are you not apologizing?
I didn't do anything wrong.
What?
I'm speechless!
I'm going to report you to the police!
The likes of this one should eat beany rice.
Eun Seok's mother!
Eun Seok's mother?
Mother.
The expert already confirmed it.
This suicide doesn't make sense...
["The Head of Detectives" - a famous Korean cop series in 1971~1989.]
The test result came out.
Stature, age, blood type, they all did not match.
- What about the fingerprints?
- Well...
Pay attention to the... Good job, you're doing well.
Did you find Director Goo?
Yes, he's in the Bongcheondong neighborhood.
I'll send you his location.
If you don't change your mind, then, yes, I'll fire you.
Give me a bottle of soju, please.
Yes.
What business do you have here?
Are you going back to your cottage?
Get lost.
You bastard, what the heck are you doing!
?
All in all, 1.05 billion Won.
This is the money you need to shoot the final scene of 5 minutes you want to shoot.
What game are you playing?
!
Those 5 minutes... shoot them.
In exchange I'll ask you one thing.
What is this drama to you?
Nothing will change. "Morning of Kyeongsang" is my last drama!
It's not.
It's the foundation for the next 10 years of your career.
I don't care about your sweet-talks about the future!
Each episode is 60 minutes, so 1200 minutes in total. Spending 1 billion on 5 minutes makes the remaining 1195 minutes a stretch.
No, this way your future 10 years disappear. For those momentary five minutes, please don't throw away your glorious 10 years.
And five years ago don't forget the day when you hit rock bottom.
Hey you crazy bastard!
Stop!
If I give up on those five minutes, what are you going to give me?
The 5 lost years that you want to forget I will turn them into the joy of success.
Cleanly, without a trace. Hey punk,
I told you to throw that bluff away first.
If it's a bluff or not, you will see when the time comes.
Director, about that Director Goo and Anthony...
What about Anthony? Director, about that Director Goo and Anthony... What about Anthony?
Well, looks like Anthony has worked the kinks out with Director Goo, so everything is in working order now! In working order?
Yes!
Sounded like Anthony was able to persuade Director Goo.
It seems like... Anthony has changed somewhat.. He's a different man now...
What a strange world. Alright, I see... Director Goo, huh?
Alright.
- See you.
What?
Really?
Yes, I decided to curb down my ambitions. That is a great decision, Director!
But what made you change your mind? Nothing special, it's just 5 minutes, not worth throwing out 10 years' worth of glory.
Wow, I'm so impressed!
Impressed?
Whatever.
Once you have enough experience, you'll become more sensible, too, Writer Lee.
At any rate, I heard that Hyun Min refuses to do it?
Yes, he says swimming in the sea is too dangerous and difficult for him.
He asked me to change the script if we couldn't change your mind.
Okay.
So it's too much for Hyun Min, huh?
What time is the appointment with Hyun Min?
I'll get to the point right away with Director Goo, and you need to chime in right then.
I got it.
You have to stand your ground. Be firm.
Got it?
I said I understood.
Let's go, Sparta.
Get that thing ready, please.
Yes, I see.
Director, I heard that you like to drink.
So we prepared a special gift for you.
I stopped drinking.
Excuse me?
Oh, we didn't know.... Well then, instead of wine... Nah, it's ok.
As long as I don't drink. Here I'll pour you a glass.
Yes.
Director.
About the ending scene of episode 1, the way I see it, there is something that bothers me.
We're thinking that the scale is rather unrealistic...
What do you think?
I agree.
I was a bit overly excited about that.
That's right, Director!
It was overly unrealistic, indeed!
Nowadays, the computergraphic technology is so advanced, you can just do that.
You can just shoot it in an artificial pool, there's no need to do it in real sea water.
That's so old fashioned.
That's not what I mean.
I meant that my ambitions went over our budget.
What?
Then, how are we doing that scene?
Even if we turn down the scale, we should still film at sea.
Um, Director, what do you mean by that?
No matter what, we've got to shoot Kang Hyun Min swimming in the sea.
Forget the clown that just poses in front of the camera for good looks, we're going to turn you into a serious actor with a tenacious passion.
How about it?
Don't you want to stop being a clown and start becoming a real actor?
No.
I cannot accept that.
Hyun, Hyun Min!
The wilder the dog, once tamed, turns into something great.
Give me just a moment, Director.
Hyung, how did it go?
You don't know?
Tell them they won't see me until they get this thing sorted out!
Huh?
Stop!
HEY!
Stop!
You can't just storm out like this!
Come back in, let's talk to the Director... Even if I die I'm not going back in, so shut the door and GET LOST!
Alright, then.
You're not getting out?
I can't get out.
If you don't get off, I won't get out either even if I die.
They just took off.
Yes.
I also saw with my own eyes that he had a drink.
Okay.
I understand. You've worked hard.
Get started with our arrangements.
Yes, I understand.
I heard that you and Director Goo have reached an agreement.
Yes.
That's a relief.
Were you sincere in saying it's a relief? I'm just dying to know, how did you do it?
Do what?
Neither Director Goo nor you, Representative Kim, are known for compromising their positions.
I made a deal.
What kind of a deal?
I don't think I'm obliged to divulge that information to you.
What?
!
"A clown that poses in front of the camera for a few good looking shots"?
"Turn me into a real actor"?
How dare he say that to me, Kang Hyun Min!
Don't you agree?
!
Why couldn't he say that?
What?
!
Don't even think about going back and hiding in a pension in Yangpyeong to play video games.
Turn the car around.
Get out.
I know you don't really have anywhere else to go.
Why are you like this?
!
You're like a kid whining to his mom whenever something goes wrong.
Why wouldn't I have anywhere to go?
Then where?
Where would you go?
I'll go see my mom!
What? Ouch!
Man, everything is just driving me crazy!
Aigo, what do I do?
!
Aish, darn it!
Shouldn't we get out?
Oh, are you alright?
I'm really sorry.
Why do something that'll make you sorry?
Let the insurance company take care of it.
Ah yes, we shall do that.
Oh, by the way, aren't you Kang Hyun Min?
Never mind. Just give me your contact info.
Of course.
Man, what a hassle!
What is going on?
Just a fender-bender. I rear-ended his car.
Oh, is that so?
Have you reached an agreement?
Yes, yes.
Ah, but I think he has been drinking.
Drinking? Sunbae-nim, I'm sure your project's going well.
Thanks to you.
I haven't done anything.
It's all thanks to your skills.
What is it?
Bad news.
What bad news?
Kang Hyun Min just got caught for drunk driving.
His blood-alcohol content is enough to get his license suspended.
Where are you?
Ah, where is this?
Hello?
Hello, Lee Go Eun?
SAY SOMETHING, Lee Go Eun!
Preview
Tell me! How did this happen? If we let Kang Hyun Min resume his role, the public will criticize our whole broadcasting station.
Shouldn't you partner up with someone more trustable?
Let's replace Kang Hyun Min with a different actor.
I heard that Writer Lee Go Eun isn't doing so well, either, so both writer and actor should be replaced.
I'm just asking for some time!
Carzy Dog, we need Song Bit Na. Absolutely.
I think everything was a set up, not a coincidence.
Oh Jin Wan.
Ah, you're firing me, Kang Hyun Min?
If we don't get this worked out in three days, we're doomed!
Ah, I don't know, I don't know I'm going crazy!
The only person who can solve this problem is your mother.
You know, my tummy aches too much, Doctor.
She doesn't have any external injuries or any special symptoms, why hasn't she woken up yet?
The question is.. whether there is brain damage.
Who are you?
Do... I know that person, too?
Why do you not know me?
You absolutely must remember me!
Even if you have to use the power of hatred, just remember me, Lee Go Eun!
Episode 7 Asphalt Gladiator Outpatient Reception AdmissionDischarge Protocols Come to your senses, Lee Go Eun!
Tell me! How did this happen? !
While the cops caught me for drunk driving, she was on the phone, and then... it all happened so quickly. Go Eun! - Go Eun!
- Wait, we have to get her to a scanner right away.
Go Eun, why?
Go Eun!
Go Eun!
How did this happen?
Why is my kid lying there unconscious?
Answer me!
I'm sorry. If by any chance, something happens to my child, I am really going to KILL you!
Go Eun!
Go Eun!
Go Eun!
Go Eun!
Go Eun!
- There he is!
- He's here!
Kang Hyun Min!
What is your take on the situation?
Please, even a sentence will do!
Kang Hyun Min!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min, would you please explain your drunk driving charge?
Is it true that you were fully drunk, and that your license is suspended?
What kind of effects do you foresee on your acting career?
Kang Hyun Min Drinking and Driving Can he do the drama?
How in the world can he drive while drunk right before his new drama is about to start?
If we let Kang Hyun Min keep his role, the whole public might criticize our broadcasting station.
Well, so... what does the chief producer in charge think?
Since shooting hasn't even started yet, I don't think we need the risk of such a controversial actor...
So you want to cut him off?
! Yes, if you do something wrong, you should be punished for it, but you don't want to overdo the punishment to the extent of killing Kang Hyun Min's life as an actor!
He's done it to himself!
So, just because the media is criticizing him, you want to jump on the wagon and end his career, too?
I cannot abandon my actor like that!
Replace the actor?
Let's replace Kang Hyun Min with a different actor.
Director!
It doesn't make sense to keep Kang Hyun Min when the public sentiment is in such an uproar.
Plus, it's not just my personal opinion, but the whole drama department's opinion.
I can't do that.
Is it because of the contract fee that you've paid him in advance?
We can't take the risk of his ruined reputation affecting our business just to accommodate your financial situation.
I've also heard that Writer Lee Go Eun is not doing well, either.
I think it's better to replace both the writer and actor this time.
Please, give me some time.
Replace them at once.
Please, give me some time.
Representative Kim!
Just give me some time!
Three days.
Three days.
Resolve all this in 3 days.
If you don't resolve this in 3 days, no matter how much financial loss may incur, we replace them both.
There's no way that Anthony would want to replace Kang Hyun Min and forfeit the 2 billion won he paid him.
Besides, there's no other actor to replace him with.
Moreover, the writer is in a coma. In short, "Morning of Kyeongseong" is beyond repair at this point.
So, what is it you want?
If "Morning of Kyeongseong" is a no go, wouldn't the Empire's "Elegant Revenge 2" be a good sub for it?
I know very well that you had lent Anthony a hand, Assistant Director.
Forgive me for saying this, but why don't you lend that hand to someone more reliable?
Someone who can really be a big help when you're in need.
Look at them all.
Such vultures.
They don't care about the person who got injured, but only about Kang Hyun Min if he's coming or not.
How heartless they are!
At any rate, I hope Writer Lee wakes up from her coma.
What a disaster this is.
What is the problem?
She doesn't have any serious external injuries or odd symptoms.
Why isn't she up yet?
The question is whether there is any brain damage.
Once we take a look at her brain scans, we'll have more information, but at this point, it's hard to say.
What are you so excited about?
Well, we're really getting started with the project now!
I know very well that the fate of not just me and you, but everybody involved with this drama depends on the choices I make.
That's why I can't give up.
We'll have victory for sure!
Are you sure?
What percentage is your confidence rating?
You always said to me, "Believe me."
This time, it's your turn to believe me, Representative.
I'll stay here, so you guys can go back to work.
No, we'll wait here, too, until she wakes up.
Yeah, even if I tried to work, I don't think I'll be able to focus on it.
Are we going to collapse here?
Are we going to collapse, throwing a fit like a whiny kid?
Lee Go Eun will wake up.
Absolutely.
Get back to work so that we can start shooting with her script right away.
Yes.
Thank you.
What is it?
What is it that you have to say?
About the drunk driving incident of Mr. Kang Hyun Min....
Actually...
-Representative!
I found it.
The first news report of Kang Hyun Min's drunk driving charge was written by Reporter Park Seong Bok of Daehan Daily.
What, Park Seong Bok?
Yes.
The same reporter who had written that calumnious report about the death of the delivery man 3 years ago.
It was also Reporter Park who rear-ended Kang Hyun Min's car.
I think it was all a scheme, not a coincidence.
Oh Jin Wan!
Where are you going?
You can't go in!
Representative... please leave.
Move out the way, unless you wish to die.
Didn't I warn you that I was going to win this...
Are you crazy?
You want to be sued?
Then do it.
Oh Jin Wan, I'm warning you!
You can do anything to me, but you can't touch my actor, my writer, my people.
Since when did Anthony, to whom the end justified any means, become an advocate of justice?
I learned it all from you.
In order to get what I want, I have to be cold-blooded and merciless, extinguishing every last ray of hope!
Then, here's another lesson for you!
A death match is only between gladiators.
PD Joo?
Representative, I'm calling to inform you about Lee Go Eun.
Deputy Director... it's me.
What I told you to do, I think you should hurry up and proceed with it.
Immediately.
Representative!
What?
The CT, did it come out okay?
Um, about that... She woke up, but... Lee Go Eun, are you okay?
Who are you?
Do I know him as well?
You really don't know me?
I'm not sure.
Why don't you know me?
I am Anthony.
Anthony who buried you in this field 3 years ago after only using you, and later threw you away again without mercy! It's me, Anthony!
Do you even forget your hatred and resentment towards me?
This can't be.
You must remember me.
Even if you have to use the power of hatred you must remember me, Lee Go Eun!
So you do know that.
How mean you have been to me!
Always you were the one who tricked people, but now how do you feel being fooled?
Do you think I fell for such a clumsy act of yours?
I'm sorry but I have been producing dramas for the last 10 years.
I have used the "amnesia" plot more than 100 times.
And also, you... were the worst among all of the amnesia acting I've seen.
So if you have time to make this kind of petty joke, use that time to write scripts!
PD Joo already brought me my laptop anyway!
Hey, Go Eun! I brought your favorite, grilled mackerel....
You're here?
PD Joo, make sure Writer Lee gets everything she needs.
Yes.
By the way, you totally fell for it earlier, didn't you?
I have never seen you being like that before, Representative.
So... you mean "Elegant Revenge 2" of Empire Production?
Well...
It's not easy to find a top actor who is available for shooting now. And moreover,
Empire Production has finished its set-up for shooting with the casting of Kim Jin Woo.
Kim Jin Woo?
Right now?
That's why it's Empire Production, isn't it?
Even if we wait one or two days more, it's not like any great option will suddenly pop up.
Director Nam, let's proceed (with Empire) right away, no need to wait more (for World). But as it was a promise I gave as Director, let's wait just for 3 days.
If there is no change after 3 days, I will reconsider the project. Since Writer Lee Go Eun is conscious now, I'm very relieved then..
I really drank just one shot, but a license suspension? Those articles are all lies!
That breathalyzer was obviously manipulated!
It's not the time to whine that you're wronged!
Whine?
Representative... If even you are treating me like this...
Do you know why you were casted?
Because you're good at acting?
Because I like you personally?
No, it was because the station would give me the broadcasting schedule if I brought you.
But because of your reckless behavior, we're now in a crisis and there is no other actor to immediately replace you either.
If we don't solve this issue within three days, all of us are finished!
What do you mean "finished"?
Is it decided at the broadcasting station?
Me?
You will fire me?
Me, Kang Hyun Min?
What... should we do now?
Did you request the blood test?
Yes, but...
I'm not sure its result from National Forensic Service will come out within three days.
Hyung... It's Bit Na, but she says your cell phone is turned off so...
Tell her I'll call later.
Then, what are you doing for media play?
That's, well...
Hyung... it's your mother... Oh my god, seriously!
Mom!
How many times have I told you that I can't come to you? Right now, there are tons of reporters waiting in front of my house, to bury your son, Kang Hyun Min, alive!
Mom!
Do you think your stomachache is a big deal now?
Aren't you watching TV, Mom?
Right at the moment when you had a stomachache and went to the ER, I had a big accident, too!
I don't know.
I'm going crazy.
Let's talk later, bye!
Watch your language to your mother!
She's my mom, but she doesn't even have a clue what happened to her son.
She's nagging why I'm not visiting her when she has a stomachache.
Then, you should visit her!
Huh?
The only person who will resolve this situation is your mom.
Well, from now on, our new script will begin.
Hyun Min, you should lower your head as much as possible.
Representative Choi and Kwang Soo, you guys make a way for Hyun Min, with the sincere mind to help him visiting his sick mother quickly.
Hyun Min's mother had a little bit of stomachache and went to ER around at 6PM yesterday.
She's goes to the ER so often just like she would visit her spa for a massage.
So the doctors get so frustrated when they see my mom's name.
Yes.
She came again? That's because when they look at her, she looks too fine.
So, can you tell me which pain brought you here again?
The stomach.
My stomach really hurts, Doctor.
But last night, to run to your sick mother at ER, you had no choice but to drive. But, yesterday, Hyun Min's mother left the ER at 7 PM.
And the time of my accident was later than 8PM.
That's why we should make a story.
Hyun Min got a phone call before that and ran to the hospital!
Mom left the hospital with a doctor's facile prescription.
But then, Bam!
There was an accident.
Then, today?
Hyun Min's mother's symptom, which wasn't serious yesterday, became serious today!
Hyun Min...
Yes.
You and I, the fate of us is all depends on your mother's acting today.
Where do you feel the pain?
Ma'am, where is your pain, tell me!
Bring doctors!
Bring doctors!
It hurts, hurts, hurts!
For now, take CT scans!
Yes.
Ma'am?
Oh, my tummy!
Aigoo!
Mom! Mr. Kang Hyun Min!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min had an accident on his way here yesterday, so he couldn't come sooner.
I heard that she complained about serious stomach pain yesterday, too.
Uh.... yes, yes, yes.
Then, Mr. Kang Hyun Min's DUI last night was because of an emergency with his mother's health?
Then, Mr. Kang Hyun Min's DUI last night was because of an emergency with his mother's health? Why didn't he explain that sooner?
Listen, people, this is a hospital.
Contain yourselves.
Does the mother of Kr. Kang Hyun Min know, too?
We're waiting for the lab results currently.
Do you have any predictions about her diagnosis?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min will have a press conference to answer all these questions.
Please leave now.
This smells fishy...
Fishy?
When is Kang Hyun Min's press conference?
This coming Friday.
No one must know about our plan.
Therefore, make sure that your mother, Representative Choi, and Gwang Soo all zip it up.
Yes.
We must keep this secret especially from Lee Go Eun, who'll write your apology to be read at the conference.
Even from Writer Lee Go Eun?
But she's one of us, though?
She is one of us, but she can't be one of us when we're lying.
What do you think she'd do if she found out about our dishonest plan?
I got it.
At times, the enemy within us can do the most damage.
Never, never must she know!
The mother of Mr. Kang Hyun Min is ill?
Last night, she couldn't keep anything down even.
Her stomach was in such a pain... Then, when you said that you were going to see your mother... you were being serious?
I know you don't have anywhere else to go, why are you being like this?
You're like a kid whining to his mom when something goes wrong!
Why wouldn't I have anywhere else to go?
Where?
Where are you going?
I'm going to see my mom!
Happy?
That's right.
I'm so sorry, I didn't know...
I understand.
I'm sorry for not even contacting you when you woke up.
I had no idea that Kang Hyun Min's mother was ill.
At least the media reports are sympathetic toward Kang Hyun Min.
What a relief.
Great relief indeed, now that Writer Lee is also recovering swiftly.
At any rate, that bastard Representative Oh has reserved a spot in hell.
Attacking Kang Hyun Min's career with the DUI charge was all his doing.
Man, the bad karma between our Representative Kim and Representative Oh...
Could it be that they were a married couple in their previous life?
Why else would they be such enemies?
Why have you been ignoring my calls?
Is there someone beside you?
No.
It's okay now.
I'd like you to find out one more thing.
See if the mother of Kang Hyun Min is really ill.
Do you really have to go this far?
What's wrong with you?
Are you getting cold feet now?
Writer Lee could have been seriously injured!
Why do you think I planned this whole thing with Kang Hyun Min's DUI?
My target is Anthony.
Kang Hyun Min's DUI was just one of the means to get to that end.
Lee Go Eun is just an unexpected, unfortunate casualty.
I don't care who gets hurt and whose career gets ruined.
Whatever you say, I can't.... If something goes wrong, do you think you'll be safe?
If I expose that you were my mole, your career in this field will be totally over.
Think of your frail grandmother. Unless you want to spend the rest of your life penniless and jobless, and end up watching helplessly as your grandmother passes away, and end up watching helplessly as your grandmother passes away, do as I say.
Do you really think Anthony made it up?
We shall find out soon enough. The moment the truth comes out that Kang Hyun Min's mother was faking her health problems, the DUI charge will be nothing compared to that. It won't be just Kang Hyun Min that falls, but Anthony as well will be doomed forever beyond hope in this field.
It's not like I committed a serious crime, why do I have to do this?
Regardless of the circumstances, you did drink and drive.
You've betrayed the trust of the public that have loved you, and you've hurt their feelings.
This is not just for show.
Unless you sincerely repent, this whole thing is pointless!
Did I ever ask them to love me?
They just fell head over heels for me because I'm so hot!
Yes, you're hot.
So you can also make a hot apology.
Unless you want to ruin your career.
Alright.
Happy?
Happy about what?
You need to practice.
Practice until it hurts.
I am only what I am thanks to the love I receive from the public, and I express my deepest regrets for betraying the trust of so many fans... Wait, I think you should pause for a moment after "betraying the trust."
I think you should lower your gaze slightly before moving on to the next words.
I am only what I am thanks to the love I receive from the public, and I express my deepest regrets for betraying the trust of so many fans.
Good. Next.
I do not want to try to justify my actions of that day with my personal circumstances...
That's not it.
You have to show a surge of emotions.
Think of your mom and pause.
...with my personal circumstances.
Nah, too weak.
Go again!
I will accept all criticisms for my actions and use them to drive myself to become a better person.
Hmm.
Good.
Pardon?
You think it was staged?
Well, I wouldn't put it past Anthony if he's desperate enough.
Listen, what if Anthony just wanted to calm down the public sentiment by staging a health issue with Kang Hyun Min's mother who is not sick at all?
Moreover, what if the truth came out?
This would certainly harm the reputation of our station!
Yes, I understand.
However, I don't think we should make a hasty decision about this. Think about it, if, as you say, the truth were to come out, Kang Hyun Min's career would be most affected, right?
Would Kang Hyun Min really gamble his whole career like that?
Listen, Director Nam. The actor's career depends on the impression the public has of him.
There's nothing he couldn't do to restore his ruined reputation.
Alright, I see.
If, as you say, Assistant Director, the issue turns out to be staged, then... I will take away the broadcasting slot from "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Got it? When answering questions about your mother, don't hesitate.
You'll look more dejected. Still,
I think we need to be clear about the issue with my mom.
Absolutely not.
Too much water drowns the miller.
Who's going to drown? Mom did go to the ER that day, and she's in the hospital. Mom did go to the ER that day, and she's in the hospital.
Listen carefully.
If people find out that your mother is a fake patient, everything is over.
It will be totally over for you and me both, forever.
Make no mistakes.
The fate of you, me, and our drama depends on today.
Fate?
Yes, Representative.
Was I right?
I was right.
Did you record their conversation as I told you to?
Yes.
Good. Send me a copy of that file, and I'll text you Director Heo's phone number, so send him a copy, too.
You still remember... what I told you, right?
If you want to live, just do as I say.
Representative!
What is it?
I have something to tell you.
Say it.
Just a moment, can we talk privately?
Since we're busy now, let's talk later.
This is the cell number of Director Heo.
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes....
Yes.
The blood test result of Hyun min came out.
It's 0.04 and lower than the limit!
Okay.
Now, we just need to finish this press conference well.
Oh, thank you Jesus!
Are you ready?
Let's go.
I, Kang Hyun min, have lived getting generous love from all the people for the last several years.
Yes, Representative.
Why has that file not been sent yet?
That was... because my cell phone wasn't fully charged until now.
I will send you that file now. If someone has too many thoughts, he loses many things as well, you know. You know what I mean, don't you?
In addition, for all the difficulties the production team of "Morning of Kyeongseong" had to go through because of me, I'm giving my sincere apology to them.
So I drove the car myself.
[Voice message]
[Voice message] However, about my personal situation, I don't want to make any excuses.
Writer Lee could've been in a really dangerous situation.
Why do you think I planned Kang Hyun Min's DUI?
My target is Anthony.
Kang Hyun Min's DUI case is just one of all means to hit that target.
Lee Go Eun was just an unexpected, scapegoat.
I don't care who gets hurt, or who would be doomed.
Woo Hee Jae, this bastard!
I don't care.
This is the cell number of Director Heo.
What were you trying to say?
I'm sorry, Representative.
I got it.
In return, you do only what I tell you to do.
STOP!
Writer Lee could've been really in a danger.
Representitive!
Anthony!
In a press conference which is being aired live, a represntative of a top-class drama production company reveals his own dirty trick to the nation himself. It could've been a fun show, but luckily you stopped it. With that file, what are you going to do?
That depends on how you behave from now on.
If you keep digging into Hyun Min's mother's case, I will reveal this file.
Then, the public will criticize you, and Chairman will fire you who ruins the reputation of the company, just like he did fire me 3 years ago.
Are you saying to make a deal with me?
So you're not as dumb as I thought.
Oh, and one more.
Through all medias you're dealing with, friendly opinions about Hyun Min will be poured out.
Now, the combat between gladiators is finished. I will go back to the Colosseum and enjoy my victory, so you'd better hurry up. However, based on all the criticism and advice you've given me,
We will finish our press conference now.
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Are you okay?
How was I?
Was I good?
The best.
You were bada**! Especially when you lowered your head for a moment, then, as you continued to talk, with tears...! It was art!
Of course!
I had especially worked on that part.
Have a seat!
Where is Anthony, anyway?
What is the reaction of the reporters?
Much better than I had expected.
They're already releasing sympathetic news reports.
- Applause!
- But let me make one thing clear.
I swear, I don't care what kind of a life you lead.
It's up to you whether you ruin yourself with drugs or gamble your life away. However, I will not tolerate any mistake from you when you are Kim Woo Jin of "Morning of Kyeongseong."
What did that loony say?
Did you understand him?
I sure didn't!
Congrats!
Good job!
Well, considering the blood test results and all, I think it's ok to keep Kang Hyun Min on board.
What do you think?
It's too early to tell yet.
What's important is the public opinion. Correct. The numbers may be legally acceptable, but it's still true that he drove after drinking alcohol.
I think it would be wise to watch the movement of the public opinion.
Yes, - Director.
I reviewed the reactions of the media reports and the netizens.
Yes.
The voice of sympathy is decidedly predominant.
Is that so?
Yes.
Then, as planned, the November slot is reserved for "Morning of Kyeongseong" with Kang Hyun Min.
Agreed?
Oh, Hyung, look at this!
Scroll up, up, up, oh, this one!
This one! Oh yes, that's a good one!
Nice shot!
It looks like you were crying.
Really crying!
That tear is a real tear.
It's worth a million dollars.
This is amazing!
Take a look at this, Director.
Our Hyun Min Oppa must have been in so much pain!
The netizens keep posting comments.
Hyun Min Oppa's big heart is public knowledge.
Good.
As you see, the public opinion about Kang Hyun Min is changed 180 degrees overnight.
Right now, netizens are signing petitions to go against Kang Hyun Min being fired.
Come in.
Are you Writer Lee Go Eun?
Who are you?
Please to meet you.
I'm Hyun Min's mother.
If you're Hyun Min's mother...
Kang Hyun Min...?
Yes.
Superstar Kang Hyun Min's mother.
You're still weak, stay sitting!
You're even more sick than I am; I can't stay sitting.
Well, I am sick.
Even if I'm a fake patient.
What are you talking about?
You know.
Flowers?
Yes, Director.
We've decided to go with Kang Hyun Min as previously planned.
I understand.
You don't seem too happy.
No, I am happy.
Very happy.
By any chance, is this what you've already anticipated?
What do you mean?
No, nevermind. Then, see you later.
The station's drama department decided to keep Kang Hyun Min.
What is that reaction?
Do you have something you haven't told me?
Something I haven't told you?
What?
What is it?
Kang Hyun Min's mother just came by.
How could you trick me like that?
It's fine now that you know.
How can you say something like that?
If I told you honestly, would you have agreed obediently?
No!
I would never have participated in such a farce!
No, I would've dissuade you not to do that!
See!
You're really immoral.
Turning someone's perfectly fine mother into a seriously ill person in a second wasn't enough?
Someday, she will be seriously ill, I guess.
For your drama, you've thrown away your father, now it's your mother?
Because a husband and a wife are equal.
Get out.
I don't even want to look at you, so get out!
I'm busy anyway, so I can't stay longer.
Ah, that devil!
This devil will go back to home to Hell now, so you'd better write the script for episode 6.
Is he crazy or something?
What do I do?
Hello.
-Hello.
What's that?
This is the letter Hee Jae left.
Without saying anything, he said he's going to resign for personal reasons.
Hey.
What is this?
To Writer Lee Go Eun? Representative, I'm not brave enough to meet you in person, so I'm telling you like this.
Over that last few months, Represantative, who treated me so well and to the people in World Production with an apologetic heart, I'm a sinner. The fact that I will not receive forgiveness even with any excuses,
I know that very well.
So I, somebody pathetic, will be leaving.
Our writer's precious drama, "Morning of Kyeongseong"
I will pray that it will be successful.
Be healthy.
Writer Lee!
You've been well?
You must still be sick; you should have told us before you came.
I'm better now.
You want me to forgive him?
Yes.
I know you're really disappointed and angry, but can't you forgive him?
No.
A person who betrays once will betray again.
You make a mistake once.
And Hee Jae, he's having a hard time, living with his sick grandma these days.
That's why he must have been greedy from his youthful passion.
He's regretting it right now.
What does that have to do with me?
He's already fired.
So don't butt into my business, and you do your work.
Why did he get fired?
Actually, I don't really know myself.
That bastard... even when I ask, he doesn't reply.
He doesn't even pick up his phone anymore.
Do you possibly know his address?
Grandma.
Do you possibly know this house, #30?
That's our house.
We don't have any coffee mugs... No, it's fine.
This is good too.
By the way, where's Hee Jae?
He hasn't come home from work yet.
It's about time for him to come home.
By the way, didn't you say you're working with him?
Oh, I'm on a vacation.
It's so strange today.
A lot of people from work visited.
Really?
Wh... Who was it?
They didn't tell me their name, but... they said to send this on to him.
Ah Grandma, do you mind if I read that? Yes, yes. Because of my eyesight, even if I read it, I wouldn't know what it was about.
Shut up and come to work early, before I really fire you.
Grandmother, I'm here.
Writer Lee.
[Loony]
What?
What are you doing?
Whatever I'm doing, why do you have to know that?
Just...
Have you reconsidered about Hee Jae?
That betrayer will come to work again.
Well done.
Earlier, he came to me and begged me to let him work again, crying over and over.
So, is that the reason you took him back?
No, I just decided to use him for only three months.
Don't worry about useless things, and if you have time to make a call, just write scripts.
Wait a moment.
One more thing.
What else?
Why did you lie?
Are you talking about that again?
Reinstating me as a writer was done by you, not the Director of the Drama Department.
I never did that.
Tell me.
Why did you lie? I guess you heard some weird rumor, but stop talking nonsense, and just write more scripts.
Because I'm blind, I only see you.
Because my heart is frozen, I hug you.
When my trembling lips touch your ears, I say the words I dreamed of ...
Good morning!
Since I first met you, I love you.
Who are you, huh?
This brat!
Huh?
Welcome back!
...those words that came out as tears little by little, fill up my heart as if my heart will explode with those words.
Because both of my eyes are blinded,
Okay, then let's go for our other half face, the main female actress.
Yes.
Kim Ah Joong will work a movie with 16 million won budget next month.
And Lee Bo Young is staying abroad now after finishing the last drama so successfully.
Kim Seon Ah, who is so hot these days, is already scheduled for a drama which will be aired Wednesday-Thursday in M broadcasting, so she's not available. And Jeon Ji Hyun has a casting inquiry from Hollywood now, so she's waiting for its finalization. And the last, Eom Ji Won, who is doing both TV and movie a lot these days, is done filming a movie now and reviewing scripts for the next project.
She says she will never work with Kang Hyun Min, even if she dies.
Why is Sung Min Ah not on this list?
I heard her schedule is available as well.
That's because... she's an actress of Empire Production.
She can't work with us because she belongs to Empire?
Yes, because our company is not on good terms with Empire.
More accurately, Anthony and Oh Jin Wan are enemies so it won't work, right?
But why does it... have anything to do with me? Crazy dog, you told me that if I give up that momentary 5 minutes, you will make sure that I will forget the past 5 years by the joy of success. To taste that joy,
No matter what.
Look at me now (In French)
Wow, you are too good.
Miss Min Ah, you're fantastic, yes, great!
Great pose, ok, yes! Now, ready, 1,2. Good!
You worked well.
It's done for today.
Good job.
- You all worked hard.
Good job.
Miss Min Ah, you were amazing today, as always.
I didn't do much.
It's all thanks to your great work of photography.
Aigoo, you're even modest!
Sung Min Ah is indeed the best.
Thanks for your work today.
Don't you ever schedule another shoot with that man.
Why not?
Did he do something wrong?
I can't concentrate because of his bad breath!
Alright, I'll look into it.
A skilled photographer who doesn't have bad breath, ok?
Why don't you guys go ahead.
It has been a long time.
You haven't changed.
You're still good at surprising people.
Take this.
What is that?
It's the script for the mini series for November Mondays and Tuesdays of S Broadcasting.
I did hear that you were broke.
I guess that means your scale has shrunk, too?
For you to offer me a script of a rookie writer.
Compared to the pathetic writers of Empire who haven't written anything worthy of the return of Sung Min Ah for the past three years, it's completely different.
What to do?
In addition to writers, I also screen producers.
Is there anything else you need to know about me?
How much are you going to pay me?
As much as you want.
You can't afford that, ever.
Sure I can. Because you're the best actress, Sung Min Ah.
Read it carefully and give me a call.
My number hasn't changed.
Who is it?
Who... Who is it?
Did I startle you?
I'm just teasing.
Quite spacious for a writer's studio.
About the same size as... the second bathroom of my living room.
Quit mocking, it's my very first studio.
Why have you come?
Well, just, uhm...
I thought I'd check out the writer's studio.
I heard that... you saw my mom.
Yes, I did.
I also received great words of wisdom.
Hey, you know it was inevitable.
Thank you.
I normally don't say thank you very often.
Thank you.
I truly appreciate what you did this time.
I feel as if...
I found a new friend.
Then, be good from now on.
Yeah, about that...
Wouldn't it be better to take out that swimming at sea part?
I'd love it if that part was cut out from the whole script!
I don't know about the others, but you absolutely have to swim in the ocean.
Absolutely!
Is that all?
You said you can afford to pay me because I'm the best actress there is.
Yes.
Then, let me ask you one thing.
Do you still... love me?
If you would act for "Morning of Kyeongseong."
Preview Ep 8 How much longer do I have to bathe those filthy brats?
Episode 8 Reinforcements Will Not Come Hyung, why is he so late returning? That's what I'm saying.
It has already been for more than 5 hours since he left to meet her. Um... Representative?
What? It's nothing. PD Joo.
Yes.
Quickly write a news release and circulate it to these media companies I checked, the first thing in the morning tomorrow.
But... what article are you talking about?
The title is like this:
Sung Min Ah confirmed as "Morning in Kyeongseong's" lead actress.
Huh?
An article about Sung Min Ah joining our drama?
Sung Min Ah has decided to do our drama.
Quickly get started on writing the news release. Good work,
Crazy Dog.
Are you now ready to taste that joy?
That's right.
It's now satisfactory.
What say you, feeling good?
The best, that's my feeling. Even if Anthony is very nasty and mean, if you look into him, isn't he a pretty okay producer?
Yes.
Sometimes I want to beat him up, but like today he's quite an okay producer.
By the way, when was the last time you took a bath?
I bathe everyday.
But I'm not scrubbing often.
No wonder...
How can it be a human body?
This is an eraser!
Just kidding around.
Bath over!
Good bye.
Bye-bye Hyun Woo.
Don't catch a cold.
Oh, really nice!
Why are you here?
It's my turn.
Teacher, please let me take a break for a moment.
We're just going to the bathroom for a second.
Yes.
For how long do I have to wash dirty, dead skinned rascals?
You decided to do volunteer work for the meaning of self-reflection.
Do you think I'm asking because I don't know?
! It would be enough to just shoot a few photos.
How much are you going to push me?
! You, listen to me carefully.
In order for you to protect your image as a lead actor which you ruined you are not only scrubbing body grime but also shaving your hair. (word play in Korean)
My hair?
Right. Even if you have to show them shaving your hair, you have to show them that you're self-reflecting.
I'll just scrub off dead skin.
Good.
Scrub it off with all your might.
What's with you?
Eat it.
What?
I told you to eat it.
If he gives you something to eat, you should eat it.
Director!
Sung Min Ah?
Are you saying that Sung Min Ah got casted?
Right.
Korea's top star, Kang Hyun Min with the best, Sung Min Ah.
This is great!
We have the best casting combination, right?
Hyung!
Seems like you should come back. The kids are getting cold waiting.
Ok, all right.
I'll go and scrub off those erasers.
Get going.
Yes.
No way!
Even if I don't know anything else but this. Even if I don't know anything else but this.
With Anthony's drama you definitely can't.
Why?
Are you asking because you don't know?
! You always said this when I was a rookie.
This is a royal order.
Shut your mouth and do what I tell you.
Now I give the royal orders.
Meet all the conditions they request, and proceed the contract.
What?
I definitely told you.
I told you to proceed with the contract.
Why on earth are you being like this?
Have you forgotten what Anthony did to you?
! One more thing.
Don't ask me for my reasons from now on.
If you want to continue to keep me under contract.
Our affiliated actress Sung Min Ah is doing Anthony's drama?
I'm sorry.
Even though I told her no, it's what she wants.
No matter what it takes, I will stop her from acting in that drama.
No.
Let her have her way.
Pardon?
What do you mean...
The attack is allowed just once.
In this one opportunity, it's important to go for the kill.
If you say "the only opportunity of attack"..?
Where did you say the investor of Anthony's drama was?
Topstar Sung Min Ah confirmed for 'Morning in Kyeongseong'
Set up the date for the script practice session and the drama press conference on 19th.
Kang Hyun Min Sung Min Ah
Lead actor and actress of 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Notify the schedule to all media companies, actors, actresses and staffs.
Sung Min Ah's drama comeback after 3 years Don't forget to send an invitation respectfully to Watanabe Group, the investor.
Yes!
Drama "Morning in Kyeongseong" ultra-luxury casting Yes, Reporter Park.
Have you been well?
This is World Production calling.
I'm sorry but as it was too urgent.
How is it going with our invitation cards?
Yes, please send them by 12PM.
Representative!
The sun has risen a while ago.
Stop sleeping, get up and get ready to go out.
Where are we going?
Sung Min Ah said she wanted to meet you.
Sung Min Ah?
What is Sung Min Ah's character like?
Probably better than yours.
I read from an article that she is very thoughtful.
Hello! I'm Lee Go Eun.
You're younger than I thought.
Alright, let's get some fresh air. You two have a chat.
I read and liked the script.
It's been a long time since a script made me greedy like this one.
Thank you.
But...
Yes?
If there's a problem...
I'm talking about episode one.
Don't you think that's too much of the theme?
Too much of the theme?
"A man's sorrowful life story who lives in the dark age."
The theme should thicken as time passes, not shown all at once like that.
That's why I decided to start by explaining the background with the characters around the main guy.
That's not what I'm saying.
Then... The role of Jin Hye Rim I'm taking on, she's not at all in episode one and appears last in episode two.
If you brought an actress who is paid many tens of thousands won, you have to show her for the amount of time that fits her price.
What are you imply...
The female lead isn't the male lead's maid of honour.
To fit the name of Sung Min Ah, revise the script starting with episode one.
I fully understand what you've said.
But the planned story line is...
Writer Lee.
Yes.
Under whom did you learn?
Why are you asking?
Just like I thought, you really smack of a rookie writer.
I will make this clear.
You did not cast me.
I chose you. No, I chose this drama.
So right now I'm not asking a favour.
I am not trying to give you advice either.
So you're saying right now that we don't have a choice?
It seems you're not too much of a fool.
Do you always crush writers like that?
No.
I didn't need to.
The writers I worked with up to now were veterans.
So they were aware and did all that was needed.
The rookie writer who knows nothing will only say one thing.
This drama is not a drama for you alone.
Even if it's for Sung Min Ah, I can't fix even one character.
You can't fix it?
Yes.
For an actor who is full of egoistic pride and doesn't think about the whole drama it's unnecessary.
You look like you ended your chat well...
Yes.
Very well.
You knew, right?
What?
Do you know what Sung Min Ah said to me?
What could she have said. To match the role to the worth of her name.
By bringing me even when you knew that, I guess you tried to shake up my script again with the actress this time? What could she have said. To match the role to the worth of her name.
By bringing me even when you knew that, I guess you tried to shake up my script again with the actress this time? Do you think that way?
I was wrong for trusting you.
So... what have you decided to do?
Who did you say was the new director of S Broadcasting?
Okay, let's see.
Well done.
Oh. Make it possible to film this part also.
There will be a hidden scene behind the building.
I've got it.
Good, I think it's done here, so...
Let's go to Jin Hye Rim's room.
Oh, Writer Lee!
Hello.
Oh, why are you here instead of writing?
So it's like that.
What's the best thing to do, Director?
What did Crazy Dog say?
It's useless to hear from him. They planned together to change up my script.
Actors and actresses are so weird.
Sometimes, they run into the fire for their pieces, and... even with not eating and staying up all night, they dedicate to their roles. But what I'm saying is this.
There is something that the actors never give up.
What is that?
The tenacity toward their roles.
In other words, they never step back when it's about getting their portion.
Why is it like that?
Well...
That's just their nature.
With the natural tenacity they have, they accomplish their jobs.
They are like animals with the only instinct for acting.
Then can't we change their instinct?
Changing the instinct...
That's difficult even for me.
Director!
All these are part of the struggles.
I wish you a good luck.
Yes, Director.
Yes!
Ah, Writer Lee. Come in.
So, I'll get going.
Are you?
No need to see me off.
I'll contact you.
Yes.
Writer Lee, have a seat.
Yes.
I heard briefly about it.
Yes.
Right.
I myself am a drama creator also, so I sympathise with your point of view and I'm rooting for you.
Thank you.
But now I'll talk to you as the director of this drama's broadcasting station.
Sung Min Ah is an actress which all broadcasters want to acquire.
You know that, right?
Yes.
Sung Min Ah's demand is a demand that is totally understandable from the point of view of a lead actress.
I hope you consider this point.
Did you listen well to what the broadcasting director said?
Do you have to use your strength to pressure me like that?
Yes.
If I say that I do.
Let's talk for a while, us.
Our conversation is possible after the revised script comes out.
I clearly told you, I have not agreed to modifying the script.
You.
Don't act up.
Your talent is quite something.
First Writer Lee Go Eun, now even up to Sung Min Ah.
You return the people whom you threw away coldly back to your people.
You don't personally need to get an inferiority complex. If there is one thing that I don't have, it would be the inferiority complex that you stupidly grasp on.
That's not an inferiority complex, it's called fury.
Don't make the mistake of thinking that you've already won.
I never tried to win against you. I am not doing that now, nor will I ever do that.
Someone like you can't become my target.
What to do?
You're my target.
Then someone who failed with the target right in front of him, must be feeling frustrated.
Laugh as much as you can while it lasts.
There will be a day when you will be stomped on severely.
Sang Tae Gu.
This is also so-so. Something else.
Bit Na.
You said this Oppa is awesome in whatever I wear.
But why is this not good?
Because you're cool it's just so-so.
If that chick Sung Min Ah falls for you then what?
Then it can't be helped.
Oppa!
Oppa is many people's man.
And Oppa belongs to Bit Na. Don't you know that?
We're just shooting a drama poster.
From now until the drama ends... that bitch Sung Min Ah will be stuck to you throughout!
Then would you rather have me wear outfits like a beggar while I film the drama?
Then promise. That you won't look at that chick first.
Instead of a promise I'll give you an oath.
That's enough, right? Sung Min Ah is known for her punctuality, but even if I step on hard, I think we will still be late about 20 minutes.
Why are you stepping on?
Go slowly.
What?
If the main actor Kang Hyun Min is late, even if it's not 20 minutes but one hour they have to wait.
Even if she's hot these days, is she this drama's protagonist? If we praise her all the time and do whatever she wants just because she is an actress, it will spoil her. From the beginning, Bam!
We should tame her.
Run slowly, Kwang Soo!
As for the poster's theme this time, what about this?
In this mood... - No, I prefer this one.
Will that be ok?
What?
What? Sung Min Ah keeps her appointments as sharply as a knife?
So, didn't I tell you to run slowly or what?
Kwang Soo?
I tried to come as slowly as possible, but...
Sung Min Ah arrived!
Hello, Director.
Oh, CP, hello! - Wow, you look fantastic!
You're the best.
Sorry I'm a bit late.
No, it's okay. Do the make-up and the shooting will start right away.
Yes.
- See you at the shooting studio.
Min Ah.
Seems like you're not good at keeping appointments.
Sorry. Then...
See?
Dejecting her with simple and impact words.
She's totally dejected.
Yes, President.
Now almost all actors have been decided, only the date that we start shooting is left.
So this is no lesser than Anthony.
It is preposterous, but there is one thing I have to tell you...
Let's hear it. We may be a bit later that the shooting date that is specified in the contract details, is that going to be alright?
Seeing how meticulously you have done the preparations, that is possible.
Don't pay too much attention to it.
Thank you very much!
Yes.
See you at the production report conference.
Oh, good!
Wow, whatever the camera takes is totally like a masterpiece!
It's killing!
Hey, this... this one...
Good!
Good! Oh, Min Ah, it was a good shot!
Okay!
Good!
Do it properly.
Act...ion!
Wow, this one is great, isn't it, Sunbaenim?
Wow, whatever the camera takes is the piece, piece!
You worked hard, Director.
Well done, well done.
What did I do today?
This is a piece of cake compared to the upcoming brutal schedule.
But... you asked for a script change?
I heard it from the broadcaster.
Yes.
I thought it would be better if a few points were amended.
I wish the change to be completed before the script reading session, but Writer Lee seemed to have a lot of thoughts in her mind.
Please talk to her well.
Then... Ah, yes, yes.
You can leave.
Aish, Writer Lee, this...
If she's asked for a script change, she should revise it! She's not yielding again! Sunbaenim,
I think you should step in here. What do you mean "step in"?
Well, Writer Lee, that kiddo, she's quite daring, sometimes. -Last time, when Director Moon...
She's not daring, but persevering.
Without that much backbone, how can she write scripts?
No, that... that... Ah, really... Sunbaenim!
Hyung!
Kwang Soo.
Who on earth hired that photographer?
Why? Like a die-for fan of Sung Min Ah, he kept saying Min Ah, Min Ah...
Min Ah...
It was so annoying I though I was going to die! Hyung, hyung, hyung!
As you were not at the make-up room, I thought you left.
Yes. Anyway, since we're going to spend a lot of time together from now on, let's get along well.
I'm sorry. My hands are a bit dirty...
Then... What was that?
Is she...?
Is she really refusing the handshake of this superstar, Kang Hyun Min?
Crazy...
Aren't you disregarding him a bit too much?
He's just a puppyish brat who thinks he's an actor.
He's not even worth conversing with.
Yes, Chief Producer.
Writer Lee.
Are you in your right mind?
Pardon?
What do you... mean?
Sung Min Ah of all people is asking for a script revision.
Why can't you yield?
Why?
! No need to talk more. As per Sung Min Ah's request, change the script.
It doesn't suit you.
In a building that doesn't suit you at all and the shabby office...
Did you come to confirm that?
That writer...
How is she?
Exactly, the same as you see.
She just has her temper, not compromising.
Can you fire that writer?
I'm asking if you can fire her for me.
What are you talking about?
Who knows.
I just wanted to know your thoughts.
Before that let me ask something as well.
What are you going to do if Lee Go Eun won't change her script to the end?
The things I want, I get all of them, as you know. Of course,
I couldn't have only one person, though.
In the future it will be difficult as well.
I know.
That you don't feel or want such a thing like love.
But I don't care.
Because I will make you love me.
After all, that was what I thought.
You were trying to shake the scripts as you want by a scheme with Sung Min Ah.
There was no such intention at all.
But it's clear that it was predetermined.
It was predetermined?
Sung Min Ah is an actress in the position who can choose not only her co-star but also the writer.
This is the inevitable process we should endure from the moment Sung Min Ah was cast.
You promised me that you wouldn't touch the script.
I definitely did.
But now you're telling me to change it, even by using the actress, managers of the broadcasting station!
I have not told you to fix the script even once.
What did you say?
Fighting with a director, struggling with a producer, being interfered by the broadcasting station, and having a power game with actors consistently are a drama writer's fate!
That's why I was once fired by the pressure from the broadcasting station, and fought with you all the time, Representative.
Now I'm fighting with the actress.
Right now, you know I would obviously lose, so you're telling me there is no need to fight.
No!
Fight!
Fight openly on the square against her!
You said you wanted to protect your script.
So fight. Fight and win!
But in return, you're fighting alone.
No one at all will help you.
So... being a writer is an infinitely lonely job.
Oh, right now?
Yes. Understood.
Representative.
It was CP Lee Sung Gyu that just called.
He wants you to come to the station right now.
Right now?
He wants to talk with you about the production budget.
Fight!
Face the challenge and fight on!
You said you want to protect your script, right?
Then, fight. Fight and win.
However, you'll be fighting on your own.
Not a single soul will help you.
Writer Lee.
Joo PD.
I have a favor to ask of you.
That does not make sense.
It's a period piece with Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah as the leads.
You got 10 billion won from the sponsor, you have enough to cushion that! That 10 billion is only an investment that needs to be returned to the producer once the drama is finished.
Well, that.. that is true.
Of course, I know that.
Total production cost is 9.8 billion.
The 300 million per episode makes 6 billion.
Projected international sales is 1.7 billion.
Cable network sales is 10 billion.
That's only 8.7 billion in total.
You want me to take a deficit of 1.1 billion won?
No... You want me to take a deficit of 1.1 billion won? No...
That's not what I mean...
No...
That's right!
Product placements! You can get money that way!
The historical setting is during Japanese colonization. Product placements are not viable!
That...
I see.
I'll talk with the Director in person.
Representative Kim...
Why do you have to give us so much trouble?
Just go easy on us.
And besides, the Director is not in his office at the moment.
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
It's my treat.
Are you putting it on the corporate card as the Director?
Hey, I don't use the corporate card on my personal business.
Installments for 3 months, please.
Hey, what is Wan Soo doing?
Unemployed.
Representative Kim, what brings you here?
I came to see you, Director.
I'm sorry.
I guess I need to talk with him.
Alright, I will see you later.
I'll call you
- Okay.
What is it? Is it urgent?
It's about the production cost of "Morning of Kyeongseong."
If it's about the production cost, it's no use for you to come here, Representative Kim.
It's been already decided, as you know.
I don't understand why you're giving us an amount similar to small dramas like "Children of Paradise."
Do you think that drama will guarantee as much commercial advertisement profit as my drama?
Probably not.
But that is why that drama is important to us as well.
Because nobody invests money in it.
Nobody expects it to make any money.
If you know that it's not going to make any money, why do it?
Because the world today desperately needs that drama. Understood?
Are you saying that "Morning of Kyeonseong" is not a drama the world needs?
No, "Morning of Kyeongseong" has its own value, too, that the world can benefit from.
Plus, it's got commercial potential as well.
It's a great drama.
However, even dramas that nobody thinks will make money need to be produced, is what I think.
Not for profits, but for its benefits to the society.
Do you enjoy playing holier-than-thou like that? Sure, I suppose someone like you wouldn't know the joy in it.
Sure.
It seems that the massage place is the most likely place at that hour.
Welcome.
May I see your member ID?
Miss Sung Min Ah is inside, right?
I'm here to see Miss Sung Min Ah.
A visitor?
Who?
Lee Go Eun, she said you know her.
Tell her exactly what I say.
She said that unless you brought the changed script, she won't see you, so you should leave.
Yes.
Ah, hey!
- I'm sorry. - Please, stop!
I'm sorry.
- You can't do this!
It's an emergency.
Listen, stop...!
Here you are.
I'm so sorry.
Get out of here, now!
Just one moment.
You're quite an interesting person.
I'm more interesting once you get to know me better.
Can you give us some privacy?
Now, entertain me.
I'm not making dramas as a charity.
Yes, I know very well that all you live for is money, Representative Kim. Oh, and also, from now on, any business about the drama should be communicated through the CP in charge.
Aigoo, fancy meeting you here!
Director Nam Woon Young!
Though I'm rather late, congratulations on your promotion to Director.
I suppose you are late. Thanks anyway.
I see, you hate me.
Why would I do that?
You're at the top of the food chain in the drama world.
Well then, excuse me...
Long time no see.
Let me give you a warning.
Leave this field while I'm still being civil.
You're the one whose time has come to retire, Chairman.
I decide my own destiny.
I can also decide your destiny.
And what are you going to decide?
Just wait.
You'll find out soon enough.
I look forward to it.
That's why you can't accept it.
Yes.
You know the risks involved with that decision.
Why insist?
Why are you risking your job for this? The legendary British actor Alec Guinness once said, "There's no such thing as a small part.
You're trying to school me?
Didn't you decide to take this part after reading the original script? You found worth and potential in the details of the script, then, you shouldn't actively seek to ruin the potential you saw in it.
It would be bad for you yourself, too.
Also... there will be no revision of scripts.
So you can drink soju too.
What's the result of the fight?
I heard from PD Joo that you went to see Sung Min Ah.
There will be no revisions on scripts.
And Sung Min Ah will attend neither the script reading session nor the production report conference tomorrow.
Yes, she will attend.
Why do you think so?
Because Sung Min Ah is a professional.
Professionals have infinite sense of responsibility about their work.
A profession with sense of responsibility is doing this for her own interest only?
Both a professional and an amateur, they all make a mistake.
Then, an amateur blames the world, but a professional takes time in reflecting on herself/himself.
Take time...?
That's right.
Time which an amateur like you wouldn't dare to think about.
Both a professional and an amateur, they all make a mistake.
Then, an amateur blames the world, but a professional takes time in reflecting on herself/himself.
Time which an amateur like you wouldn't dare to think about.
I mean, episode 1, don't you think it shows it's theme excessively?
Finally, the first day of the official schedule for the drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" is starting.
At 2 PM, meeting all actors and reading the scripts. At 5 PM, moving to the auditorium and having the production report conference.
From now on, everyone, remember exactly what you have to do and proceed without fail.
Yes, I understand!
Goo Hee Jae, set up the room for reading scripts by 2 PM.
Manager Park, check the actors as per their schedule and make calls to confirm.
Ah, yes, so you're on your way here?
PD Joo, go to the auditorium directly, and check all the details for the last time.
The main poster on the background must be placed with extreme care.
Yes, Reporter Park!
Manager Han, call all reporters of media companies and portal sites, and get their anticipated questions in advance.
Yes.
Now, I think you should go to the reading room.
Okay.
Ah, and Watanabe Group contacted me, and told me that Chairman won't be able to come.
I see.
When would he arrive?
It will be at 2:35PM.
But.. do you have to pick him up personally, Chairman?
To the airport, I can go...
The leader of Watanabe Group which assets are worth of 60 billion yen (about US$730 million) is coming, so I should show some courtesy to him at least.
What is with that face?
I made a revision on the script.
These are the revised version of episode 1 and 2 of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Revision?
Why did you change your mind?
Yesterday, I went back home and took time to read them again.
And?
I could see that.
The excessiveness of theme.
So, do these scripts not have excessive theme any longer?
I will show the completion of theme at the last episode.
You sound pretty confident.
If I weren't confident, I wouldn't have even started it.
How is it?
This rookie is pretty good.
Her writing skill is quite workable.
Ah... this is not good.
What is it?
Does it make sense?
Does she have any brain or not?
Hyun Min, even so, shouldn't you read the revised script before the reading session? Hyung, in a car, why would I read it, hurting my eyes?
I can read it when I get there.
What do you think?
Can't you know by just smelling it?
That this is quite something?
What are you doing?
You should print out the new scripts!
Yes. By the way, you're not even on episode 1, but you came quite early.
You could've come 1 hour late.
What was that?
Aish, with my temper, I just should've...
Go inside first. You were so confident, but I guess you were scared after all.
Yes, I was scared.
I was scared if I would lose the composure of my life.
Thank you all for coming here for "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Now, let's start the reading session for episode 1 and episode 2.
Well, episode 1 of "Morning of Kyeongseong".
Scene 1, panorama of Kyeongseong city, lively Kyeongseong city is shown.
On the road, a streetcar is passing, and many pedestrians between rickshaws.
Then a cut-in, "November 7th, 1938".
One man who walks through a crowd, it's the main role, Kim Woo Jin. Woo Jin, he looks around for a moment, then approaches to a peddler whose face is covered with a towel.
What do you think the weather of Kyeongseong would be tomorrow? he looks around for a moment, then approaches to a peddler whose face is covered with a towel. What do you think the weather of Kyeongseong would be tomorrow?
A peddler, looking around for a moment, pulls out something from the inside pocket and gives it to Woo Jin. Woo Jin, getting close his face to that peddler.
There must be one more.
The peddler, opening the towels which covered the face, is the main female role, Jin Hye Rin.
The other one will arrive tonight.
It will come out at midnight, through the check register machine.
Woo Jin, after taking a moment to think something, whispers.
Woo Jin, after taking a moment to think something, whispers. Mr. Kang Hyun Min, it's your turn to read.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
When I said I wouldn't swim in the sea, you didn't even sniff, but now without my permission, you were totally seduced by that fox and changed all scripts.
And now what?
What's wrong with me?
I can't do with these scripts. No,
I won't.
Director, I'm sorry.
With this feeling, I can't do this, either.
So, it's finally started.
Pardon?
What do you mean?
Everytime, whenever the drama starts, this happens, the war of nerves among animals.
Pardon?
PD Joo, do you know where we are?
This is a jungle made of asphalt.
What are you doing now?
Are you asking that because you don't know?
Lower your voice.
Don't you see those reporters?
Smile. And relax your hardened face first.
If we're not going to use the original scripts, I won't be able to smile comfortably.
Never.
Until when will you whine all the time, without thinking straight?
Do you think I'm now whining?
This way, please.
Ah, here is colder than Fukuoka.
Ah, yes.
The president of the best broadcasting station in Korea came himself to welcome us.
Since you're coming, of course, I should come welcome you, Chairman.
Thank you.
This is the president of SBC.
And this is the son of Watanabe, the heir of Watanabe Group, Mr. Watanabe Kenji.
Ah, I see. Nice to meet you.
My name is Jeong Ji Hyun.
Nice to meet you. (in Korean)
I'm Watanabe Kenji.
You're speaking Korean very well.
Because I have business in Korea too.
Please keep making investments for our future Korean dramas too.
Let's go inside.
Yes, this way.
So what do you want me to do?
Are you saying I should go back in?
The production announcement is soon.
Should I go out there alone?
Kang Hyun Min is going to come.
I trust our Rep will bring him back.
So, please, come back in.
Writer Lee Go Eun, I thought I warned you already.
Don't act up.
That's not it
This is a favor.
I guess this drama is nothing to you as if it's a children's play. The penalty of three times of 2 billion won you received for this drama, if you're not going to bring that 6 billion won back, go back to that room immediately.
I didn't say I wouldn't play for this drama.
I said I can't do it with that revised script.
Why don't you go back when I say nicely?
Why?
Will you punch me otherwise?
What are you doing?
I can make it even worse! Using your perfectly fine mother to cover up your DUI case, should I spill it all out that it's all fake? Leave if you can, and I will tell people everything in that press conference.
Are you saying you will kill both of us?
Whether dying now or dying slowly after public humilation, it's all same to me.
Don't lie to me.
Do you think I will fall for that bluff?
I don't care if you believe it or not. I have nothing to fear any longer. Choose whether we die together, or live together.
Soon, the production report conference for Drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be started.
Please turn off your cell phones for a moment.
Have a good time, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thanks to Go Eun, I'm having a chance to see this kind of show.
By the way, why is she wearing black sunglasses indoors?
With that, can you see properly?
Is this young wench deaf?
I guess she's totally fine.
Kang Hyun Min stormed out during the reading session.
Kang Hyun Min?
Kang Hyun Min?
Why...? Did he run away?
Why?
-Yes.
Why?
He said he wouldn't play for the revised script.
You punk...!
You should've held even his pants to stop him!
Right now, the press conference is getting ready to begin.
What about Sung Min Ah?
She also said she would leave, but Writer Lee is holding on to her.
Where is the MC....?
Now, the production report conference for "Morning of Kyeongseong" will be started.
Hello, everyone. I'm your host, Lee Il Hwan.
This is driving me crazy
Okay, then let me introduce to you the two stars appearing in "Morning of Kyeongseong," Kang Hyun Min, Sung Min Ah, and also Director Goo.
Let's bring them in.
Hey, what are you doing?
Quickly go and find out what's going on.
Yes
What a comedy this is... Well, I guess they are having a moment to give us more dramatic effect. Please wait for a moment.
Well, the male lead actor, the female lead actress and Director, would you please come out?
I'm going crazy..... Because of the script reading session which was planned before this conference, I'm afraid the schedule has been a little bit delayed.
Please wait a moment longer
They say that Kang Hyun Min might not attend this conference because of some urgent issue.
I'm sorry
I'm afraid I will have to leave first.
Yes
We'd better get going, too.
Kang Hyun Min's not arrived yet?
Yes.
What do we do?
What else is there to do?
We need to go in there at least.
Well, let's go in.
Going in without the protagonist?
I'm sorry, Director. I came a bit late.
As much time as you took, you just make the food tasty..
What about the Representative?
Well, the situation in there didn't seem good. But are you okay to be here, doing nothing?
What brought you here?
Well, this isn't a place I can't come, you know.
Oh, introduce yourself to him. This is Kenji, the new CEO of Watanabe Group.
I'm Kenji, the son of Watanabe Hiroshi.
Then... the Chairman is...
And as the new Chairman of Watanabe Group, I'm telling you, that all investment to World Production and Anthony Kim will be withdrawn as of now.
And 3.4 billion won previously given for the partial investment must be returned within this month.
Episode 9 Battle of Red Cliffs It seems the situation in there wasn't good. But is it okay for you to be here, doing nothing?
What brought you here? Well, this isn't a place I can't come, as you know. Oh, introduce yourself to him.
This is Kenji, the new CEO of Watanabe Group. I'm Kenji, the son of Watanabe Hiroshi. Then... the Chairman is...
His illness has gotten more serious, so he gave all management rights to me.
And as the new CEO of Watanabe Group, I'm telling you... that all investments to World Production and Anthony Kim... will be withdrawn as of now.
And the 3.4 billion won previously given for the partial investment... must be returned within this month.
That is not possible.
If all the management rights were passed on to you, so would have the investment contracts as well.
How can you ask for the 3.4 billion back?
I believe that the starting date for shooting is today on the contract.
I am making a reasonable request based on a breach of the contract.
However, Chairman Watanabe and I had a verbal agreement on it!
A business man makes promises by signing and proves with documents.
And also, Anthony, let me tell you again...
I am the chairman now.
I'll excuse myself.
Oh, yes.
Didn't I tell you before?
That I determine your fate as well. No matter how much you wish for it,
I'm not going down this easily.
Well, it's not going to be easy.
I wish you good luck.
Stay strong...
Sunbaenim.
You two, I don't want any more tension like this after today.
Such tension needs to be while you're on camera, not out of it.
Okay, let's go in.
What going on?
-Just stay still.
Really?
They are here now.
Yes, everyone, you waited long enough.
The "Morning in Kyeongseong" actors, Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah.
This way.
Well then, please give a big round of applause.. ..for the two lead actors and the director of 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Just now, what were they talking about?
Withdrawing the investment..?
Is it true that we have to return all the investment money we received?
What did they say? Say something.
Representative...
Representative!
Well then, we'll begin the photo time for the two actors.
I request the actors to please use the center of the stage.
Ah, really, they look so beautiful like a newlywed couple.
Please use the center of the stage.
I did tell you but the main lead of this drama is me.
I don't think you're acting skill can handle that.
That's funny.
That's what I should be saying.
Please look at the front.
What is the reason you are rescinding the finances?
I don't have any interest in your drama.
What I am interested in.. ..is whether you can pay me back the 3.4 billion.
I can.
In case you can't... are you willing to give up your hand as a promise? I can promise. But before that,
I need to confirm if Mr. Watanabe also thinks the same. Then give it a try.
Right now, Father is in Korea.
He is seriously ill.
He wanted to be in Korea during his final days.
He has passed away.
The Chairman... has left you a letter before passing away.
Mr. Anthony, I'm sorry.
It seems that I am finally paying for all the wrongs I have committed during my life.
I can sense that I'll be in hell soon.
I wanted to watch your drama please forgive me who left without keeping his promise.
Even if Chairman wasn't able to keep his promise
I will keep that promise.
Even in hell, you will get to see 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Watanabe is dead.
That's too bad. Now that the investment is cancelled for sure, there is nothing Anthony can do.
It's not over yet.
Yes?
Anthony will be running around, looking for money.
We have to stop him from getting any investments.
However, it is going to be difficult to gather such a big amount in so little time.
Is it really worth it to go to that length because of Anthony?
Anthony, that bastard, is someone who wants to tear me down. Until I see his last breath fade away with my own eyes, this war is not over!
When he said he couldn't come to the showcase, I had no idea it was because he was ill.
Who would've ever thought he'd pass away like that.. Anyway, it's a big hit if we have to return the investment.
Out of the 3.4 billion, we've used most of it and have only 100 million left. In other words, before this month is over, we have to find 3.3 billion?
Can't we find another investor in time?
Given this economy, it will be tough to find a willing investor.
Besides, the amount is too huge.
Even if we were to take a loan, we have nothing for collateral. Even if we miraculously got that much money, we have to start shooting next week....
Then what are we going to do?
Are we going to end like this?
How can we give up like that after coming all the way here.
Be strong people. We never know, some kind of miracle might happen.
That's right.
We need a miracle.
However, miracle is not something you wait for but something you make. From now on, Without wasting one breath and without looking back, we're going to run only looking ahead.
Commence our meeting.
Yes.
In reality, getting an investment in a short period of time is not easy.
But we can try to get a loan from banks putting our drama as a collateral.
How much money is left in our account?
We have about 120 million won. (US$120,000)
Good, with that money, make sure the first shooting is to be prepared without any trouble.
But to return the fund on time, it would be better not to use that money...
No, the first shooting should be successful no matter what. Rather than waiting for a slow death next to an oasis which is drying up, we should run to the end of the horizon with all our strength left.
Does everyone understand?
Yes.
Does everyone understand?
Yes.
Good. Team Leader Park, arrange meetings with our main banks.
And let's contact other financial companies, one by one, too.
If we can get from three companies, the amount of each loan can be reduced, so the possibility (to get the loan) would be greater.
Yes, I understand.
PD Joo, Manager Han and Hee Jae, you guys divide the works and prepare the shooting perfectly.
Yes. Well then, from now on, run to the end of the horizon as fast as we can and escape from this desert!
Yes.
Do you want to be in a situation later with only sending a one page script?
What are you doing not getting on with your writing?
Yes, Representative.
I've made a list of minor financial companies which we might be able to get some loans.
Those are located within Seoul or near Seoul.
These three seem mostly workable.
Call them and schedule an appointment.
Joo PD, come here and look at this.
Yes.
Take a look at this.
It's 14,293,000 won.
It's way over the budget.
Please put this back.
Anthony has a lot of money.
What about this?
Camera 1 will be placed over there in a long shot.
Camera 2 on the boat, and Camera 3 will film Kang Hyun Min jumping in the water in a full shot.
What do you think?
Yes, I think that would be good.
Let's go.
Yes. Your air-date is also fixed, and the lead actor and actress are top stars.
As long as you meet our conditions, I don't think it would be difficult.
Thank you very much.
Then we will prepare all the necessary documents today and come back tomorrow.
If you could please wait for a while.
Yes, Head Director.
Yes?
Yes.
I understand.
Well this..
I don't know how to tell you.
I'm afraid that for this case, we won't be able to give you the loan.
Why are you saying this suddenly?
I'm really sorry.
This is because of our internal problem.
What is that internal problem?
I'm really sorry.
Please don't ask me about the reason why.
I'm sorry, but it would be difficult.
This drama has Sung Min Ah and Kang Hyun Min as main actors.
Its air date is also set now.
I'm sorry.
It's because our branch's situation isn't great now.
I'm sorry, but it will be hard for us.
I'm sorry, but it will be difficult for us.
Please look over it one more time.
I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
The higher-ups aren't comfortable.
Please understand our situation too.
Well, I think I'm always asking you a difficult favor every time, President (of a bank).
Right, why don't we go for a rounding (golf) some time soon?
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes.
I understand.
What is the reason that you suddenly say it won't work?
We got it ordered from the boss, so we can't do anything about it.
The boss?
The boss? I'm really sorry.
Yes, PD Joo.
Representative, We have a problem.
The ship that we rented wasn't arriving, so I checked it up.
They are saying that they can't send us the ship if we don't pay twice of what we made the contract.
What?
Twice?
Yes.
If that happens, it will be way over our fund that we planned.
What should we do?
As you know, the money is a little...
Hey Crazy Dog!
We at least need a ship to put the computer graphic on or whatever.
Are you doing this because you don't want to spend the money?
I'm really sorry Director.
Part of our investment was cut off.
What?
The investment?
Yes, however it will be resolved soon.
Please trust me.
Sung Min Ah. Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah. Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah. Seong Min Ah.
Seong Min Ah.
Again.
Again.
Again!
Still Seong Min Ah!
Does this make's sense
She said she would write it for me!
Kang Hyun Min!
Hey, what's the score until now?
37 to 38.
Seong Min Ah is leading by a lot.
Oh my God!
Jesus Christ
Seong Min Ah, that fox-like woman stole away all my scenes!
Hyung, with this time, you better memorize an extra line of the new script...
What did you say, you punk?
Do you think I could concentrate on the script now?
Kwang Soo!
But still, why hasn't the shooting started yet?
I need to go and check.
Why is the shooting taking so long to start?
Min Ah, we have a problem.
The investment from Japan is cut off.
What is going on?
Nothing serious.
They said there was a problem with the investor.
It seems we have some problems but they will be solved soon.
You know how Anthony, despite being a dog, is good at handling these things Well, don't get too depressed, let's call it a day.
As you had instructed, I made it so that the rented ship won't come to them, but is it really necessary to go to this length when Anthony's money has already dried up?
The broadcasting network needs to know that Anthony has lost the investment.
That way, his last desperate efforts will get even more gruesome.
So, how are things going then?
We're currently looking into new investors so please don't worry about it. The broadcasting license fee of 300 million per episode, we'll pay the first episode's in advance.
Thank you, Head Director.
However, this is how far I can be of help.
You have to take care of the finances as soon as possible.
If anything goes wrong, the board of directors will have an uproar.
An uproar?
They'll want to sue you for failing to fill the broadcasting slot.
[Sung Min Ah]
It's me.
Min Ah.
Yes.
I heard that you are having some difficulties
I'll solve it.
Don't worry too much.
Let's talk later.
Oppa.
Do you remember what we talked about some time before?
The thing we talked about during Christmas at my place?
Let's meet now.
Prepare well for the shooting.
That's how you can help me at the moment.
-Oppa
- Yes?
Later, after a long time.
Once I become a famous top star, if I become someone who can help you, someone who's strong and powerful...
Once you become one?
When that time comes, will you accept my help?
Sure.
We'll do that I guess.
Really?
But something like that won't happen.
There's a lot that you still don't know about me.
Like what type of person I am.
Unnie.
Yes?
What?
Contact Representative Oh and tell him I have to see him.
Min Ah. You- Right now.
PD Joo, get the car ready.
We're going to Myeongdong.
What?
No. You can't, Representative.
No, I know we're desperate, but to take a private loan...
Move.
We can't.
The annual interest rate is 200%!
This is practically kicking the bucket yourself!
I'm with him.
Even if our drama were to succeed.. no, even before that, we'll all die!
I agree with them, Representative.
Last time you did that, the company went bankrupt, you even lost your house!
The only hope we have left is Chairman Jang of Myeongdong.
Representative, I am done revising episodes 3 and 4...
What's wrong with him? All our loan applications were rejected, so now he's going to get a private loan.
Private loan?
Yes. Then. After all you've been through, you haven't had enough and are still doing dramas?
It's a drama with a set broadcasting schedule and top stars as leading actors.
The documents included are a copy of the broadcasting slot certificate and an amotization schedule.
Even still, you've come to me because you didn't get any investment.
How much?
I need three or four big ones.
You need 3.4 Billion?
Yes.
And the collateral?
My hand that will lead this drama to success is the collateral.
Please help.
Anthony. Your hand... No, your body,
Bring me a real collateral.
Chairman... Secretary Choi, take him away!
Chairman, I beg you!
I can even sell all my internal organs!
If I could give you all my scalp, I'd gladly skin my head.
I could serve you as a slave the rest of my life, Chairman!
Please, I beg you.
Just this once!
Chairman! After losing everything, coming to me again and begging like that, you're the first. I don't know how much this drama means to you, just give up!
Chairman...
You know what's crueler than money?
Human ambition. If you don't want to ruin your life, start by throwing that away.
Chairman!
Chairman, please help me!
Chairman!
Don't kick me out like this! Please, Chairman!
Chairman!
Please help me, Chairman!
Chairman, don't kick me out!
Chairman!
I beg you, Chairman!
I don't know how much this drama means to you, just give up!
You know what's crueler than money?
Human ambition.
If you don't want to ruin your life. Start by throwing that away.
Who hasn't turned in the school support fee yet?
Come out!
You must turn them in by tomorrow!
Got it?
Yes!
Good!
If you can bring the fee by tomorrow, you may go back to your seat.
What's with you?
You aren't going to bring it tomorrow?
You'll be hit until you answer me that you'll bring it.
You got it?
Answer!
You won't even if I do this?
You think you're so tough?
Answer me!
Why are you so late?
You're hungry, right?
Come and eat.
I ate already.
Why do we live so poor?
Why?
Did something happen at school?
Tell me, why are we so poor?
!
Something happened at school?
I'm not going to live like you Mom.
I'm going to earn money like crazy, and eat meat until my stomach bursts.
I'll become a big shot that rides his own car!
I'm going to make money even if I die!
Even if I die!
I'm impressed that you've lasted for 3 years in this shabby office. That you'd go to such lengths to make sure I'm ruined,
I had no idea, Chairman. You didn't even hesitate staining your own noble hands, why are you so intent on crushing me?
That's because I know the mettle of your being more than anybody else.
You resemble me a lot.
That's why I specially took a liking to you. Even so, you deserted me 3 years ago, and that wasn't enough? Even so, you deserted me 3 years ago, and that wasn't enough?
What exactly is it that you want?
Leave 'Morning in Kyeongseong' to me.
I'll give you .5 billion in return.
I'll also throw in the repayment of the 3.4 billion of Watanabe investment.
How about it?
I think that's enough compensation for all the work you've put into it so far.
Why?
Why are you willing to go so far in order to get 'Morning in Kyeongseong'?
You think my goal is to produce just one petty little drama like that?
I want something much bigger.
Although I guess the one who sowed the seed of my big ambition doesn't remember.
Give it a good thought. Whether to waste your life in jail with a huge debt crushing your shoulders, or to live an ordinary life with half a billion won.
Are you going to the chairman of Empire?
Go.
Go take that money.
I'll also drop 'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Isn't it alright as long as we can start working on the next project?
We've made it thus far, we can try again.
It should be alright if I write another great piece.
I'm sorry.
Who is it?
I'm here to meet the Chairman.
That's right.
Have you come to a decision?
Yes.
'Morning in Kyeongseong'... ..I cannot leave it in your hands.
You should know the best that you only have one week to return the investment.
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
However, I'd rather die than hand over that project to you.
You're going for a heroic suicide?
I'll leave it up to the gods.
Who knows?
You, Chairman, could be in Cao Cao's shoes, running away from the sea of red flames at the Red Cliff. [Romance of Three Kingdoms Reference] Still, in the end, it was Cao Cao who conquered the world.
Do you think I will lose?
What are you doing?
Don't you know that for a writer, good health is money and time is money?
What's going to happen with the script if you get a cold?
Why are you outside?
I decided to fight.
Is it possible for us to win?
What is it at this late hour?
Was it your doing, Representative?
What?
The cancellation of the investment of "Morning in Kyeongseong." Min Ah, I know about your feelings for Anthony, but that Anthony is totally ruined now.
Just forget about him.
Why do you hate him so much?
I'll tell you this at least.
This time, it was the Chairman himself who did it.
What is this?
We've saved up some of our wages you'd paid us so far.
We know it's nowhere near the repayment amount, but... Writer Lee made the most contribution, by the way.
The 20 million you gave me for the script and some of my personal savings.
It's quite a bit. Use it for "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Representative, be strong!
Please be strong!
Representative.
Like that would make him strong!
The director's fee you gave me.
You can pay the interest with the next drama.
Director and everybody, listen to me carefully.
Do you think I'll be grateful with this?
Please, just make sure you can look after your own selves first.
Did I hear that right?
Don't worry about it.
A person cannot change that easily after all.
So you're asking me to lend you money? Yes, to tell you the truth, of the 3.4 billion of the investment, more than half went into your payment, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
So, if you could lend the company about half..
Half?
Then, 1 billion?
So, are you asking me to pull out 1 billion?
Well, it doesn't exactly have to be 1 billion, but whatever you could chip in...
Stop!
Stop!
Why should I?
Why should I part with my own blood money? !
Tell me!
Our drama is at a crisis right now. We just need to overcome this moment of hardship, so everybody should join our efforts.
The Representative is running around looking for funding by himself.
He may not show it, but he's going through hell right now.
But then, why are you here to talk about this?
Yes?
By any chance, do you like Anthony?
What?
No, I mean, it's Anthony who's suffering with no money.
Why are you here looking for money.
Isn't that strange?
My drama is about to be wrecked, is that so strange?
Besides, if we don't secure enough funds, we may never get to see "Morning in Kyeongseong" ever!
Honestly, "Morning in Kyeongseong" started with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
I'm aware that 1 billion is not an amount that one can easily lent.
However, you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, are like a landmark of this drama.
As the protagonist of the drama, if you have any affection towards "Morning in Kyeongseong"...
I beg you.
Why is he like that?
Did he really start reading a book and fell asleep?
It's not like that.
He's been like that for a while.
Kwang Soo.
What do you think?
Yes?
About lending Anthony 1 billion.
Hyung, are you telling me you've been thinking about that till now.
Are you really thinking of lending the money?
I'm the landmarking of this work, so I should atleast think about these things.
Landmarking?
It's landmark.
Hyung, call Anthony.
Tell him that I'll help him. That 1 billion won, I'm depositing it soon.
You?
1 billion?
I'm also going to try living a little differently.
Looked like they didn't have much time, so call him now.
That I'm sending it soon.
I'm really calling.
Hurry.
Yes, Representative Choi.
Representative Kim?
Listen, our Hyun Min has made a big decision for "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Hyun Min made a big decision of what?
Since you were going through a lot of trouble because of the repayment of the investment... so our Hyun Min is thinking about 1 billion... Since he's in lots of trouble, let him just get buried in trouble!
I can't do this, Hyung, this money means so much to me!
No, no.
I can't.
That's what I thought.
You would never help anybody with 1 billion!
Hey, darn that bastard!
Hello Representative Kim? Yes, Representative Choi, tell Hyun Min, that he should make a big decision about getting ready to swim in the ocean.
The call wasn't to lend money but to ask about the swimming in the sea scene?
Yes, it's me.
I know you're busy but come out for a while.
The same cafe where we used to go often.
I'll wait until you get here.
Who was it?
What's the matter?
I'm going to run an errand, prepare a list of potential investors outside of the capital.
Yes.
See you later.
Hyung, are you crazy?
You told me to call him!
Usually, you do things at the speed of a snail.
Why were you so fast this time?
You told me to hurry!
Will you die if I tell you to die?
What?
That was 1 billion won of money!
Are you doing whatever you want because it is not your money?
Huh?
Do you know it's been 5 years?
To be back here where you broke up with me so heartlessly.
That was 5 years ago.
I'm sorry but I'm a little busy.
Can we just talk about business?
What will happen If I abandon you now?
I'm asking what will happen if I leave this project.
Did you call me to tell me you're done?
No. So that I won't leave this project, accept this money.
All I've got that is available right now is just half a billion.
For interest, I would like to receive your heart.
I guess it would still be difficult.
Your dream, I hope you can make it come true. Turn around World Production into a world class production company like 20th Century Fox.
World class 20th Century Fox...?
That's right.
Your dream when you worked at Empire 5 years ago.
Here, this is the place.
We're going to build the largest filming studio in Asia.
[5 years ago]
All the fans of Korean dramas from Japan, China, other Asian countries, plus more fans from over 60 different countries will be drawn by it.
Once we can build a theme park so that it can serve as a tourist attraction in addition to a filming studio, the profits we're currently making from dramas won't even compare.
The catch is, we need a masterpiece that can do it.
Could you take charge and do it?
If you'd put me in charge, I'm going to turn this Empire into the 20th Century Fox of dramas!
I want something much bigger.
Although I guess the one who sowed the seed of my big ambition doesn't remember.
So it was that.
Thank you.
I'll use the money well.
You're a real big help.
Thank you. Once part of the studio is finished, let's use it for filming "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Then, the land that was worth 5k won per 35 sq ft will increase its value by 5000% in no time!
Purchase this land no matter the cost!
Yes.
So, you came here because you're interested in my land?
I'm interested in the whole lot of 143k sq ft that you have.
For over 10 years, nobody has ever shown interest in it.
You must have quite a fortune for someone so young.
But I won't be buying it.
What does that mean?
In a few days, somebody else will come, wanting to buy your land.
He will want to speed up the deal, offering a slightly higher price than the market.
However, you should never agree to a contract.
Get lost.
Who do you think you're trying to fool?
I've seen tons of scammers like you in my life!
I'm sure you have seen many scammers like me.
However, you never know.
So what? If you would believe me, you can make billions without even lifting a finger from where you are sitting.
Get lost!
I'll wait for your call.
We can't afford to simply wait anymore.
We need to switch to a different production company as soon as possible.
Thinks very carefully.
If we don't do well, we will be removed from our places.
I decided to fight.
Is it possible for us to win?
Yes?
It's me.
Hello.
Like you said, somebody came to see me.
He offered more than the market price, wanting to buy the whole 143k sq ft.
So what did you do?
For now, I sent them back.
You did well.
So now, tell me what you want.
What I want is half of the profit you will make.
Invest that money in me.
That is my condition.
(Investment? )
WIll you believe me, and go along with my plan? I've even offered to double the market price, yet the land owner is being stubborn.
He's stubborn?
Yes.
He says he has no thought of selling the land.
This won't do.
I'll have to meet him in person.
Seemed like he is greatly attached to the land his father passed on to him.
It was quite a challenge to even get him to come here, with his age and all.
Land passed onto him by his father, huh?
Yes.
That seems to be why he doesn't want to sell at all.
The old live in the past and are buried in the past.
Even so, the old have a future, too.
The future of the old...?
It's their children.
The future of the old is the seeds they have sown, their children.
Like that, even as the old die away, they live the future through their seeds.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
There's nothing to think so hard about.
In short, the answer is money.
The inheritance of the past that can guarantee a bright future for the children.
Nice to meet you.
Please take a seat.
I don't think that's needed.
Just go ahead and talk.
What is the reason that you wanted to see me?
Then, I am sure that he will get to the point right away.
I will pay the triple.
Don't accept that either. The fact that I have absolutely no thought of selling my land, I thought you were well aware of that.
Well, then.
Five times...
I'll give you five times as much.
Please take a seat.
We prepared the contract.
With the condition that we will pay all the amount until noon by tomorrow.
Yes?
I just came back home after completing the contract.
Everything happened as you predicted.
I will be receiving the money at the noon tomorrow.
Yes.
I will meet you with the investment contract tomorrow.
Kyeongsung'sMorning:
InvestmentContract
What is it?
President Kenji wants to see you.
I understand.
Please let him know that I will see him within today.
President ordered us to bring you.
I am on my way to get the money to return to President.
I'm sorry but can you move aside.
Say that in front of the Chairman.
We only carry out his orders.
I understand.
Hey, get him!
Get him!
Chase him!
Get him!
That way!
Can't you think about it one more time?
Not just one but I thought about this 10 times.
Put yourself in my shoe. If you had 10 billion, Put yourself in my shoe.
If you had 10 billion, could you give it away easily?
I'm not asking you to give it but lend it.
I've also Had a really hard time getting till here.
Honestly, even if I give away 10 billions ($1 million), it will not be resolved.
It's just like pumping water into a broken crock.
How do you know if the crock is broken or not?
Then call Anthony right now and confirm it.
If Anthony could find a single penny, I'll change my mind then.
Hello?
Representative?
Representative?
Hello?
Representative?
Lee Go Eun, Listen carefully to what I say from now on.
If you walk into an alley back of our company building, there will be an iron gate at the dead end.
What is that about?
I don't have time to explain in detail.
Behind that gate, there is my bag.
A bag with the contract, which we need in order to get the investment.
If you can't contact me afterwards, that means something happened to me.
Then you will have to find the investor with that bag.
You understand what I'm saying right?
Yes.
But what's wrong?
Shouldn't we contact the police?
No, it will be too late by then.
Just do what I tell you.
Before noon today, you must go and see the investor. Then he will take care of the rest.
Hello?
Hello!
Representative.
Rep...
What is it?
What happened?
Come with me right now.
Hurry.
Huh?
Hurry.
Contractofbuyingand sellingland . About the land, I have sent the money.
You've worked hard.
But do you think Anthony will easily give up on the piece easily?
It has nothing to do with Anthony's will now. Once tonight is over,
'Morning in Kyeongseong' ... ..is ours.
Have you come back to your senses?
What are you thinking of doing capturing me?
If you let me go right now, I can bring you back the money right away.
How do I believe in those words?
Do you have an official document that you could prove it?
If you don't believe in me, It's okay if you come together with me.
Rather than that, easily... getting the money back...
I believe there is a certain way to do it.
"Morning of Kyeongsang"...
Leave it to the Empire.
At the end, is it this? With the same purpose as Empire, are you going to threaten me so that you can give my work away to Empire?
All I need is getting my money.
That's why please make your decision.
It's whether by giving them "Kyeongsung's Morning," paying me back, or... give me your hand as you promised.

Episode 10 FatedLovers Stop! Stop right there!
What is this about? I don't have time to explain in detail. Just do what I tell you.
Before noon today, you must go and see the investor. Then they'll take care of the rest. Hello?
Hello?
Representative!
"Morning in Kyeongseong"...
leave it to Empire.
At the end, is it this? With the same purpose as Empire, are you going to threaten me so that you can give my work away to Empire?
All I need is getting my money.
That's why please make your decision. It's whether by giving them "Morning in Kyeongseong," paying me back, or giving me your hand as you promised.
The promised deadline is tonight at midnight.
As long as you get the money by then, isn't it good?
Midnight?
Someone will come bring me the money by 12?
If only you decide to wait until then.
Well, since a promise is a promise. I guess I'll wait.
Until 12, you have around 3 hours and 10 minutes. Before that, someone needs to do it for sure.
So where is this gate and this bag?
Is it even true that if we find the bag, the money can be returned?
Just shush and focus on looking!
But I'm looking for it though.
It's just that I don't see it!
Gate, gate... Excuse me, aren't you Hyun Min oppa?
You think I'm not?
Nice to meet you!
- How old are you?
- In 12th grade!
You should be studying then!
Aren't you cold?
Guys, is there a gated dead end nearby? There is one if you enter this way.
Where?
Where?
Over here Hyun Min oppa.
Oh, here?
Thanks.
What's that?
Okay.
Didn't you say we were fine just finding the bag?
Hurry!
We don't have any time.
The Representative said that we have to get this taken care of before midnight no matter what.
Anthony...
Finally your end is here.
You worked hard.
Is this the right place?
Who is it?
I'm sorry for intruding this late.
I'm sorry for intruding this late. This is Mr. Choi Pil Seong's house right?
Yes it is, but he's not here at the moment.
Where did he go?
He went to meet his friends.
He said he would be drinking. He might be a little late.
Where is that place?
Why?
It's an emergency.
We need to see him as soon as possible.
Do you have to go this far?
It was your late father's wish to have this drama made.
Father's already in the past.
What I'm interested in is the present and the future.
It's better you leave this house too.
I dont need any of that past.
What is the matter?
I'm here to meet Mr. Choi Pil Seong.
Are you one of his party?
No, it's not that.
It's really urgent. I need to see him as soon as possible.
Wait a second.
I'm saying I don't have any time!
Writer Lee.
Hello I'm Kang Hyun Min.
Omo!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
This is really urgent.
We can meet Mr. Choi Pil Seong, right?
I'm sorry to say but your time's up.
Hold on a second. Please wait a little more.
Let's start.
Life is so full of surprises!
Who'd have thought that I'd hit such a jackpot after so many years of drought?
That's what I'm saying.
How much did you sell that land for?
Shush! Everybody says that you now have the money saved even for your great-grandchildren.
I get it. I get it.
Since it's my treat today, drink as much as you want.
Who's elder Choi Phil Seong?
It's me.
What's the matter?
I'm writer Lee Go Eun sent by Anthony.
Stop.
Hold on a second.
Stop!
No!
NO!
Hold on a second.
I'm 'Morning in Kyeongseong's' writer Lee Go Eun.
What about it?
I've just returned the investment fund of 3.4 billion won to you.
Returned the Investment fund?
Mr. Anthony, you're one lucky person.
Since you kept your promise, you're free now.
Yes, Mr. Kenji.
I was in the middle of waiting for your call.
Yes?
What is that about?
Let's say that the promise between you and me was never made.
What are you trying to say?
As promised, Anthony repayed the investment money.
That's not possible.
Where are you at the moment Mr. Kenji.
I'll be there.
You don't need to come here.
Anthony.
Yes it's me, Anthony.
What kind of trick did you use?
You shouldn't speak like that to someone you helped.
What?
!
I was able to resolve this thanks to you who purchased Choi Pil Seong's useless land for 5 times more money than it's worth.
Thank you very much.
I'll make sure the money is used without waste.
Anthony!
As you wanted, you became Cao Cao.
Unfortunately, you fell off from the Red Cliff to the sea of fire, though. Whatever it is, congratulations.
Anthony!
Like this, our problem is over.
We won't need to see each other again.
Anthony!
How dare you take my money! And mock me?
Shit!
Thank you very much for keeping your promise.
What have I done here?
Bankers had to do all the work at this late hour.
From now on our drama- what was it again?
'Morning in Kyeongseong'.
Oh right, 'Morning in Kyeongseong.' I'm leaving it to you.
Don't worry about it since Korea's best top stars are in it.
That's right!
I'll also be expecting from the top star.
Yes, of course.
How was I?
Wasn't I quite useful?
You're very useful for your skill to torture me by making me wait.
Yes?
You've tortured me until the very end, but now are you saying you were useful?
Ah, the old saying is never wrong.
"You saved a drowning person, but then that person demands you to bring his bundle too."
If you're going to save a drowning person, of course, you should save his bundle too!
I guess you're fine since you're all pompous like before.
See you tomorrow.
I think I should also say my last farewell.
Ms. Akiko, what are you going to do from now on?
I'll return back to Japan and live like a new person. Even though the chairman has left, please make a really good drama.
I will also watch it.
Why did you hang up without talking about me?
Well, while I was talking to him... The car taken was mine, the one driving is me and the bag was found because of me.
How big my contribution was!
You can't just ignore it!
Oh come on, I'll tell him about it later.
You definitely have to put in the word how big my help was.
If I say it to him myself, it doesn't look good.
So Writer Lee, you should make sure to mention it to him, got it?
Yes.
We're almost there.
Please turn right here.
Turn right.
You've tortured me until the very end, but now are you saying you were useful?
If you're going to save a drowning person, of course you should save his bundle too!
What were you thinking about that you are giggling like that?
So, you came back alive without being hurt.
Thanks to someone.
Thanks to someone who was so slow, I was shit-scared, indeed.
You must have been really scared. (in informal speach)
Don't talk to me without honorifics.
I was talking to myself right now.
Do I have to use polite form even when I'm talking to myself?
But... why did you come?
Thank you.
I came here to say that.
Representative
If you're that grateful, do you want to get some beer?
I don't like that.
Ready?
Action!
How is it?
How do you feel after watching the filming of the drama you invested in? The cruise scene you guys filmed in the morning was spectacular too, but the passion of that handsome actor. Wow!
This is awesome!
Wow!
Cut!
Towel!
Director!
Let's go one more time Hyun Min.
This is already the 4th time.
Can't you separately film me walking out of the water?
This scene's key point is the main role Kim Woo Jin who has went through all difficulties and survived from the rough sea!
If we use cuts, it won't have the same effect
Let's go for more realistic in one shot.
One more for the last time okay?
That's right.
You can do it since you're the best actor.
Alright!
Let's go one more time.
From the point Kim Woo Jin swims!
Cut!
You can't be shaking like that!
Again!
Cut!
What's with that dog!
You son of a b*tch!
Hey, aren't you going to control this mutt?
Because of the dog-
Cut!
Again!
Director.
Cut!
Okay!
It's a wrap!
Hyun Min!
You were awesome!
Let's all give a big round of applause for Kang Hyun Min.
Youweregreat!
Goodwork !
Are you alright Hyung?
To the car, to the car, hurry.
Put on the heater.
Heater!
Heater!
Just watching this is making me cold.
He should experience more hardships.
Even with that, he won't be able to become a real actor, though.
I guess so...
Representative!
The chairman is coming this way.
What?
The Chairman?
Yes.
He's on his way with a team of Empire's lawyers.
Legal team...?
The Chairman is here.
You're here. From now on, while Anthony had been working as the C.E.O. of Empire Production for 7 years, the lobbying fund, dereliction of duty or embazzlement he committed, no matter what it is, find anything so that we can prepare to crush him!
Yes? Find any documents about Anthony, even if it's a penny or a single receipt, and hand them over to our legal team! But, considering Anthony's personality,
There isn't?
If there isnt, then isn't it your job to make one?
He's the bastard who made me throw away my money, 8 billion won in the air.
Listen well everybody. If you want to keep eating and living with my money, find it no matter what!
NO MATTER WHAT!
Kwang Soo.
Did you really turn up the heater to the highest?
Yes, Hyung.
Are you okay?
Do I look okay?
Hurry up and shut the door. The cold wind is blowing in.
This is warm coffee.
This will make you feel a little warmer.
That's why I told you to cut out this scene from the script.
But after coming here and seeing the shoot, I think keeping it was the right decision. I'm in this state now, but how can you say that?
You looked so awesome today, awesome enough to make all the staff out there fall for you.
Was I that cool?
Of course, you were the best!
Like Brad Pitt?
Yes. Like Brad Pitt.
Inevitable, huh?
Like Brad Pitt?
It's cold.
It's been a long time... since the two of us came to the beach like this.
True.
But... why did you want to see me?
To return this.
I'm thankful but everything is solved.
Just keep it.
You know it well, don't you?
That we can never know what might happen anywhere, any how.
Something like that won't happen but if it does, I'll take it. So keep it.
How does it feel having your 3-year old work experiencing its first shoot?
I don't feel anything.
Just feel like going back to my regular routine?
Why?
Other people may not notice, but you can't fool my eyes.
Representative, you are extremely excited with anticipation right now.
Me?
Representative, you might be the person with the smallest understanding of oneself in the world.
Because it has become your habit to hide your feelings and forget about yourself.
You're talking as if you know a lot about me.
Is there anything more I need to know? I'm sorry but erase all the memories you've had with me.
Since I've already erased mine a long time ago.
I'm telling you again as the Director of the Drama Department of SBC. All actions you're making now, please stop them immediately.
So, does that mean that you're supporting Anthony more, not me?
No.
It's because "Morning of Kyeongseong" is also my drama.
Yes?
Director, the filming crew finished today's shooting and they are about to leave for Seoul now.
By the way, I was wondering if you are going to attend tonight's team dinner.
Of course, I should go to that.
Yes. I understand.
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god, oh my god! You scared me to death!
Being scared is your concern, but I asked what you were doing. When I'm feeling really good or when I'm feeling down, I'm usually doing this by myself.
If you do this, it makes you feel much fresher.
By closing your eyes like this and raising your arms up like wings and start imagining.
I'm free and flying in the sky. Underneath me
I see my work place and I also see my mother's mackerel restaurant.
Just like this after taking a long tour you come down and open your eyes.
It's the weirdest stretch I've ever seen in my life.
Stop doing useless things and hurry up to leave.
Since everyone is waiting because of you.
Everyone, attention, please!
Today, the head director of the SBC Drama Department will say something.
Hello everyone. The director should have done it.
"Morning of Kyeongseong" finally started its first step. Of course, there were many complications, but the director, actors and all staffs endured them all together, so I believe this start was possible. Well, a good result is too obvious, but during that long journey for the next 4 months,
I wish no one gets sick and everything goes well. Should we make a toast?
Everyone, raise your glass, please.
If I say, "Morning of Kyeongseong"...
What do you say Mr. Hyun Min?
Let's go with Daebak.
Daebak is good.
Alright then, 'Morning in Kyeongseong' is daebak.
'Morning in Kyeongseong'!
DAEBAK!
Here, here.
Definitely, Korean beef is different.
These days, Korean farms are having a lot of difficulties, so we should eat Korean beef a lot.
What's up with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, treating all the staff with Korean beef?
Well, that costs nothing.
You're really a lot different.
And, I'm the PR ambassador of Korean beef, so I know well about this kind of thing.
this place's meat is the best!
Beef will be served as much as you want, so order as much as you want!
Kang Hyun Min seems to be a better person than what I thought before.
He even knows how to buy for the staff. This isn't paid for with his own money. It's a sponsorship.
What?
Even meat can be sponsored?
Wasn't he treating us because he is the PR ambassador of Korean beef?
That's why he gets that sponsorship.
Alright everyone.
Our actor, Kang Hyun Min, is treating you huge with this clothing for staff!
Well, everyone, take one!
KANG HYUN MIN!
KANG HYUN MIN!
Min Ah, you should have one too.
I prepared one for you!
By any chance, these are also... ?
Sponsored. After all, he's the greatest stingy actor who never spends his own money, even a penny.
WOW! How is it?
Is your illusion about him now breaking?
Yes, you can speak now.
Who did you say you were?
You're pretty shameless.
Looking at you having so much fun after your theft.
I don't know what you mean, but I think you should first say who you are.
I'm Jo Young Eun, the writer of novel "Lovers of Destiny".
So what?
Your drama copied my novel.
I don't think you don't know about that.
I don't know about that, but I know one thing very well.
Every time when I make a drama, I get a phone call from people like you.
And whenever that happens, I say like this.
Then go ahead.
Stop your funny trick and get lost.
Unless you want to lose your money for lawyer's fee while trying to get a few pennies by blackmailing.
Representative. What are you doing here?
Let's go in, everyone is waiting.
Alright.
Hurry.
Alright, I'm going.
Well then everyone, was the meat delicious?
Yes!
Please go in.
Representative!
Representative! Representative!
Representative!
Everyone!
Now is the moment everyone has been waiting for.
We'll now listen to a song from World Production's Representative.
I can't do it so ask someone else.
But still, atleast one song.
That's right Representative. Atleast one song.
Representative!
Representative! Representative!
Representative!
Representative!
Representative!
Whose theme is it? [a famous Korean classic song "Keumkang Mountain we've missed"]
A clear and pretty mountain!
12,000 mountaintops we've missed so much.
Although they don't say a word.
Finally...
I'll stop till here.
What was that?
Is he upset because we laughed?
I will change the mood.
New writer Lee Go Eun will be singing.
PD Joo?
Must we use chopsticks well to eat food?
["Dance with DJ D.O.C" by DJ D.O.C.]
Even if we don't use chopsticks well, we can eat food well!
But when I eat food, people around me always say, "Do you have any problem with this table?"
That was suprising.
What was?
The Representative that I know wouldn't be singing in front of people.
I guess I was wrong.
I thought I knew a lot about you.
It seems you've changed.
Everyone changes.
Is that change because of Lee Go Eun?
I'm sorry but you got it completely wrong.
I'm not someone who changes because of anyone.
Even for my change, I choose to change myself.
Ow, my head.
Miss Lee Go Eun.
Yes?
Who is it?
Ms. Lee Go Eun, here is the registered mail.
You're Miss Lee Go Eun, right?
Yes.
Sign over here.
Yes.
Thank you.
Ow, my head.
What is it?
Regarding to banning airing the drama "Morning of Kyeongseong" for plagiarizing the novel "Lovers of Destiny"?
What is this?
Yes.
This is Writer Jo Young Eun.
I'm sorry but I think I told you that I have no interest in your mere novel.
Then, from now on, I think you should develop some interest in my novel.
Because I've also sent the certification of contents to Writer Lee Go Eun.
And you keep saying that I'm blackmailing you with a silly reason... No, let me tell you first why that is a silly blackmail.
What judges and prosecutors hate the most is this kind of plagiarism case.
All you've got to do is just shamelessly throw your book at them for review, hoping that that will boost the sale of your book and they are stuck with reading the whole pathetic writing, and even if they do finish reading it, 99.9% of the time it ends up being a waste of time.
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
I don't know how you got your hands on the script of "Morning in Kyeongseong" when it hasn't even aired yet, but we don't know about your book nor do we need to know about it.
What are you doing?
This is my problem.
This is 'Morning of Kyeongseong's' writer Lee Go Eun.
So you are Lee Go Eun?
Let's meet.
You don't have to meet.
Yes.
Yes, I'll see you there then.
She's just trying to stir up controversy to sell more copies of her book.
We'll only find that out after meeting right?
I'll be the one meeting her and taking care of this!
Stop wasting time and just focus on writing your script.
No, this is a problem of me and my pride as a writer.
I'll solve it myself.
You're younger than I had thought... and so rash.
I don't think I deserve to hear such words.
Look here, Ms. Lee Go Eun.
Regardless of how much you want to get fame and success, you shouldn't steal someone else's work and present it as if it is yours.
Can you still call yourself a writer? Stealing? I don't know why you would accuse me like this, but
I haven't stolen anything. My book 'Fated Lovers' was published 5 years ago.
'Morning of Kyeongseong' started 6 years ago.
Besides, the main storyline was finished a year before that, in 2005.
Do you have any evidence?
Your work wasn't even registered for copyright.
Don't think you can get away with this by lying.
You're the one being preposterous here.
I'm the one who's the victim here.
Victim?
Admit to it when I'm putting it nicely.
Admit that you plagiarized my work.
No, I will never agree to it since it's not the truth.
Ms. Lee Go Geun, I'll make sure that your drama never airs.
I'll apply for an injunction of banning the drama's broadcast.
Go deal with it. Let me tell you one more time,
I'm not a writer that steals someone else's work to make a name for myself.
Have you read my book?
You'll know once you read my book.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a novel.
What's the title?
Fated Lovers.
[Questions of Plagiarism on Morning in Kyeongseong, a drama before airing has plagiarized? ]
[Writer Jo Young Eun of 'Fated Lovers' wants to reveal the truth! ]
Whoa, even applying for an injunction of banning our drama broadcast?
Who's calling the kettle black?
I know!
Our Writer Lee Go Eun would never plagiarize someone else's work!
She wouldn't even know that plagiarizm is spelled with a p!
How presumptuous of them!
This Cho Yeong Eun seems like a weird writer. At any rate, more and more news articles are coming out, and if she's already started applying for an injunction, this is getting real serious...
- Stop worrying about it.
What they want is exactly this type of attention from the ignorant masses.
So don't concern yourself with this and do your work.
I'll take care of it.
Yes!
PD Joo, come see me for while.
Yes! By the way, what exactly is that injunction of banning the drama's broadcast? Well, when there is a controversy of plagiarism, they can make a legal request to the court to stop the drama from being aired.
Then, what if it gets accepted?
Then, the drama won't get aired at all.
The drama won't get aired?
But that won't happen to us, so don't worry.
Go make some coffee now.
Yeah, no need to worry. Get a copy of "Fated Lovers" and give it to Lawyer Park, and also send him a copy of the drama proposal and scripts for review.
But.. there's no way that Writer Lee would have plagiarized.
Is it really necessary to do all that?
We have to be ready to face them, not sit around doing nothing.
I see.
But...
Don't you think it might be the Empire's doing?
It's not the Empire.
This is too small of an issue for it to be an attack from them.
[Application for an injunction of banning Morning in Kyeongseong in progress]
Is this your doing?
No Chairman.
Of course not, it had better not be you!
If you thought of stooping down to such petty tricks like this and stain my reputation, you'd be dead, too!
It's definitely not me Chairman.
Please believe me.
Then, fine!
Just focus on what I told you to do!
No matter what, we've got to find some evidence that can put that bastard Anthony in jail!
That's your top priority!
Yes, Chairman.
Alright, Let's start.
As you may already know by now, there is a plagiarism controversy about "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Has anyone read the 'Fated Lovers'?
I took a look at it, and it seems that it's not something that can be overlooked.
However, given that they're both set in the Japanese colonization period, some similarities are inevitable.
Some parts in the book are indeed similar, I must admit. Especially the character of the female protagonist is the same, so that can be a problem for us.
The problem is what the court will decide. Plagiarism cases are generally ambiguous, but if the judge decides that it really is plagiarism, then the drama will be banned from broadcasting.
If it comes to that, things will get really serious.
We have to prepare some kind of a counterplan.
Who knows if Writer Lee Go Eun really did plagiarize her work?
Alright, I understand.
Let me first discuss this matter with writer Lee Go Eun.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Writer Lee, it's me. Director Nam, I surprised you by coming here without calling you right?
But this way, I can check on you and make sure that you're working on your script.
Can I get a cup of tea?
Yes, sure. Come in.
Yes.
Wow, you've done quite a bit of background research.
Yes.
[Fated Lovers]
But still if you had called, I would have prepared something.
No, no need for that.
You must be the busiest person right now.
A cup of tea is just fine.
I'll drink it well.
Ahh, this is peppermint flavor.
Yes.
Are you doing well?
Yes.
I know what you want to tell me.
You're here because of the plagiarism issue right?
Is it written on my face?
It's not me.
I really didn't steal it.
That's right.
You know, as one gets older, his needless worries grow bigger, too.
Yes.
Writer Lee, you should just concentrate on writing your script, and I'll discuss this matter with Representative Kim.
What do you think Attorney Park? Before we get to that, this writer called Lee Go Eun is she someone trustworthy?
Why do you ask?
I think this is going to be a tough case. The other party has hired someone with a good track record with plagiarism cases like this, Lawyer Jang Hyun Jae.
Attorney Jang?
Yes.
The retainer must be quite hefty.
This writer of "Fated Lovers"
has put her fate on the line with this lawsuit. Unless you can provide some kind of a firm evidence, the injunction of banning the drama's broadcast may be granted.
[Morning in Kyeongseong, a drama before airing in a plagiarism controversy? ] As you had asked,
I've brought all the accounting records of production budgets of the dramas that Anthony had produced while he was working in Empire.
Okay.
Good work.
Oh, right. About that plagiarism controversy of "Morning in Kyeongseong,"
you didn't have a hand in it, did you, Director Heo?
I did meet with the Writer and introduced Lawyer Choi and media reporters to her.
Lawyer Choi is pretty good in that area. Director Heo, is this the time to work on something so petty?
Were you thinking of tarnishing my reputation with such a pathetic trick?
!
I'm sorry.
Shall I stop them, then?
No.
Just leave it. However,
I didn't hear about this.
Understand?
Yes.
If you understand, then leave. If the reason for calling me is about the plagiarism issue with' Morning in Kyeongseong,' then don't worry about it since I'm taking care of it.
You know, sometimes, I envy your attitude of always making such bold statements in full confidence.
Let me ask you one thing.
This time, does that firm confidence of yours come from your trust in Writer Lee Go Eun? There is only one thing I believe in, that 'Morning in Kyeongseong's' first broadcast will be aired on November 5th.
It's only that.
I know there should be a back-up CD with a saved copy somewhere... Ah, email.
I'd sent it to Writer Jung before.
Email...
[Questions of plagiarism on Morning in Kyeongseong.
Similarities to a 5-year old novel.]
[Application for an injunction of banning the broadcast of "Morning in Kyeongseong" in progress] Writer Jo Young Eun of "Fated Lovers" wants to reveal the truth!
[The only experience she had was as an assistant writer.
I suppose she plagiarized because she had no talent.]
[I was gonna watch it because of Min Ah, but I guess not. If she can't write, she shouldn't be called a writer.]
[Rookie writer?
Plagiarizer?
] [She shouldn't have done it if she's got no talent.]
This is completely a pig's sty!
Mom!
No matter how busy you are, you should atleast clean up!
What is this mess? That's right.
What brings you here?
What brings me here...
I brought some side dishes for you.
Just take a taxi.
Got money to burn?
Don't worry about me
Just make sure not to skip your meals no matter how busy you are.
Go Eun Ah...
Keep this is mind
You... are Park Kang Ja's daughter despite what anyone says.
I raised you without much money and without a father, but I still put in a lot of love and care into you!
That's why you need to make sure that you take good care of yourself and stay healthy while you work.
Got it?
Yeah, Mom.
Oh my, the bus is here.
Mom is going.
Eat well and work.
Alright, alright!
[Director Goo]
Yes, Director. Writer Lee, is the writing going well? is the writing going well?
Yes, of course.
Don't pay any attention to that plagiarism thingy.
It happens quite frequently in this field.
Yes.
But... you might have to come here for a while.
you might have to come here for a while.
min Ah is asking to revise the script.
It's the scenes that we're shooting today.
We're shooting in the studio right now.
If you could come, I'd really appreciate it.
Yes, I understand.
Excuse me, Director.
Can we get something to eat since I'm really hungry.
Aigoo. We cannot have our actor hungry.
Alright then, we'll take a 30 minute break.
Ms. Sung Min Ah.
Judging from the underlines on your script, I guess you're trying to cram your lines at the last minute?
While I'm eating, make sure you finish memorizing them.
If you have time to eat, why don't you analyze your character more in depth?
If you don't want me the steal the scene.
Sure, so you're going to challenge me? When the right opportunity comes, I'll crush you down for sure!
The little things that annoy me!
Hyung, this is bad.
What is?
- About Writer Lee Go Eun.
Because of the plagiarism controversy, there's a lot of internet hate speech.
Is it bad?
Yes.
Kwang Soo.
I don't know about others but Lee Go Eun would never do something like that.
If it was plagiarized, it was the other writer that did it!
It must be right? If I think about it, Writer Lee Go Eun is right.
New Noir with no melodrama. If we were to do something like that book, "Fated Lovers," I would have had to hold, hug, and even kiss that bi*** of Sung Min Ah!
I think Hyun Min is seriously committed this time.
He's still got a long way to go, though.
If he's going to match Sung Min Ah's acting.
So now we've just got two solitary scenes of Min Ah, right?
Is the shooting going well?
What brings you here?
I've got to make sure that you're not out of practice, Director Goo.
Is that so?
Sure, watch me carefully and judge for yourself if I'm out of practice or not.
I guess it's break time?
Yeah, while we're shooting, Min Ah said she had something to talk with Writer Lee.
Writer Lee?
She wants some of her lines changed.
I heard that Writer Lee just got here.
It may take some time for you to witness my not-so-out-of-practice skills in directing.
We can wait.
You're here.
Yes.
I heard that you wanted me to adjust a few lines.
Please have a sit.
Ah, yes.
What's the matter with all these lines?
What are you talking about?
Director, it seems they forgot to turn off the mike.
No leave it.
Let's hear what they're talking about.
We have nothing special to do anyway.
Never mind. Episode 1, scene 43, the fourth... Gwang Soo, isn't that the voice of Sung Min Ah and writer Lee Go Eun?
Hyung, I guess the microphone isn't turned off.
It's not only that.
You're asking me to change this now?
Yes.
The lines that are underlined all need to be changed so that we can start shooting right away.
There's no way I can act with those lines.
Seriously Sung Min Ah, don't you think you're over doing it?
Even though I'm a new writer...
It's not that. Unless you want to be branded as a plagirizer for the rest of your career, change them.
What is it that you want to say right now?
You should know it very well.
I'm sure you've read the book 'Fated Lovers.'
Looking at your expression, I guess you did read it.
How was it? The character of the female protagonist, similar lines, is it just me who's seeing the similarities?
Tell me, is it just me who's seeing it?
I saw it too.
I acknowledge the fact that there are similarities.
Turn off the mic. I didn't see it before, but were you such a shameless person from the beginning? Even though the two works are similar,
I didn't steal it. 'Morning in Kyeongseong' is something I wrote with my own strength.
How should I believe that?
It's true! There are similar lines because the settings are similar, and that's because it's set in the Japanese Colonization period...
Do you think that's a valid excuse?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Didn't you admit it.
I heard it all because the mic was on.
Writer Lee
I'm really disappointed. Whatever the case, start changing these.
With these lines, as long as my name is involved, I can't act.
You have to.
What... did you just say?
I'm telling you to follow this script without trying to change it.
Representative Kim.
No matter what, we have to get the drama aired on the scheduled date.
Plus I have one request.
Don't call out the writer and demand for any change in the script from now on.
What are you doing not working on your script?
Getting the drama aired is important, but my innocence is important to me, too.
In order to take care of the injunction on banning the broadcast, yes, both are important.
At the end, even you don't believe me.
Yes, I do. I may not believe anybody in this world,
I may not even believe in myself sometimes, but that me believes in you.
Next week on King Of Dramas. Everybody, I am the representative of the production company, Anthony Kim.
This "Morning in Kyeongseong" that we are all working on should not become a drama of distrust.
The truth that "Morning in Kyeongseong" is wholly created by our writer and that it is our rightful drama, Writer Lee Go Eun and I vouch for it.
Nay, we have to believe it.
And we will prove that truth.
Meanwhile, we need to continue shooting "Morning in Kyeongseong!"
Episode 11 Line of Life and I may not trust anyone in the world, and sometimes I don't trust even myself, but I, such a person like that... trust you. But this matter will not be resolved with that.
If even you felt these two pieces similar, you must prove that you wrote "Morning in Kyeongseong" earlier (than that novel). Proving that you wrote "Morning in Kyeongseong" by yourself should be the top priority. With that, get acknowledged about your sincerity by other people too.
Director, it's me. Ah, yes. Please turn on the microphone again.
Microphone?
Turn on the microphone.
Everyone, I'm Anthony Kim, the representative of the production company.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" which you guys are making now must not become a piece of distrust.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" is solely the creation made by our writer and us.
Not only Writer Lee Go Eun but I guarantee that fact.
No, we must believe that!
And I will prove that truth.
Instead, "Morning of Kyeongsong" must keep being filmed.
That's all I want to say.
Therefore, please act without any doubt. Even so, if you still can't trust this script, then trust me and act for that role.
To air our drama without any problem, we need some solid proof to show you wrote "Morning in Kyeongseong" first.
And we should submit that proof to the court by the day after tomorrow, Wednesday.
That novelist said she wrote her first draft in 2006, right?
Yes.
Then, we just need to find the file which you wrote earlier than 2006. I know that, but ...
But? It was a long time ago, so although I looked for it everywhere, I couldn't find it.
Then, what about e-mail?
I had, but again, since it was a long time ago, every record back then had been erased. I've also contacted some people in that site, but he said it can't be restored.
Then, what about another computer?
Have you ever worked with another computer, not your current laptop?
Other than my laptop?
Yes, other than your laptop.
Teacher Jeong? (Writer Jeong) In the laptop of Writer Jeong Hong Joo's studio, which I'd used when I was her assistant, there might be my file left.
Hello, this is Writer Jeong Hong Joo.
What should we do?
It seems she's now abroad.
Where is her studio now?
What on earth are you going to do later after this?
What do you mean?
I'm doing this to go in.
Writer Jeong will understand us too. Uh, by the way, you two, are you really the owners of this house?
Yes!
Of course!
This isn't the first time my wife has done something like this.
I'm a bit... careless.
We have a big age gap, but how could you say I'm your "wife"?
Honey..
You should install a new doorlock now.
You know that, right?
Of course.
That's right.
What are doing not looking for it?
Yes.
I found it!
No, I trust you.
I may not trust anyone in the world, and may not even trust myself,
But I.. trust you.
See I told you! /i
Doesn't it feel better coming out?
I just came with you since you looked so nervous for your debut.
Let's leave after a while.
I'm not nervous at all.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe in anyone.
Sometimes, I don't trust myself either.
But there's one thing I have the ultimate trust in.
And that is how you will be the nation's, no the world's top star.
Don't tell me you use those words to seduce women?
Now you seem more like a woman.
Later, act with your feeling now.
It will be helpful.
It's not here.
The file I last saved was in 2011.
I guess everything was erased and newly saved again.
We don't need to wait and see any longer. Well, in front of the actors and staff, the writer came forward and admitted that.
Even if it's a bit late, we should prepare the replacement now.
But is it really true that Writer Lee admitted that herself? Since Sung Min Ah pushed and asked her, she said that it's true that those two pieces are similar.
That's what I heard.
They seemed similar to each other even when I read them. I will submit these materials to the court as evidence, but with only these,
I can't guarantee the result.
In the worst case scenario, the injunction to prohibit the airing of the drama, will be approved.
When is the submission of evidence due?
It's by midnight today.
PD Joo.
Yes, Representative.
Contact that novelist.
Tell her I want to meet her before that due time.
Pardon?
What are you going to do when you meet her?
She won't accept any deal for settlement.
Even if I have to kneel down or beg her, I should do whatever I can.
Even if we have to put her name as the writer of the original story, the drama must be aired.
For now, Lawyer Park, go to the court and submit these materials. PD Joo, find out where Writer Jo Young Eun is right now.
Yes.
Then, let's get going.
Is something wrong?
Why?
Do you have writer's block?
You must be nervous because the first broadcast day is coming up.
Yeah, it must be.
Aigoo.. Aigoo, why are you crying like a fool? At your elementary school literary contest, you said that it was embarrassing when I was crying.
Did I say that?
That's right. The award certificate you won that day, the hand-crafted paper Father's Day carnation, and the diary you wrote in saying you'd become a great writer.. I still have all those things.
Why have you kept them still?
Do you think that's all?
While you were in high school, you wrote me a letter saying you were going to leave the house.. After finishing 'Morning in Kyeongseong', you even gave me that plastic thing telling me you'd show me the first.
I still have that too.
When you say 'plastic thing'.. was it like this small?
Sure is!
Mom, where is it?
Why?
I found it!
What is it?
Morning in Kyeongseong - 03.14.2005.
Lee Go Eun First Draft
Is that something important?
This is great!
I found it!
I'm saved!
Thank God.
How much is that?
It's priceless!
I'm saved!
I love you!
That's such a relief.
I got a hold of Writer Jo Young Eun.
She says she'll wait for you at a cafe near her house in Heuksukdong.
Alright.
What do you want?
I found it!
I said, "I found it!"
I found the first draft of "Morning in Kyeongseong" I wrote back in 2005!
Oh, taxi!
Then, we're good.
Props team, get them ready!
Bring those chairs this way!
Still no contact from Anthony?
Yes.
Excuse me.
A decision will be made by court today..
Do you want to try calling?
Alright, let's start filming!
Tell me.
What is your reason?
Ok, cut!
Shoot me if you can.
Crazy Bastard
I said, tell me!
Hold on.
Stop filming.
Yeah. It's me, Representative Kim.
The court has made a decision.
And the result?
What..?
I understand.
I'll pass the message.
Everyone.
The result pertaining to the broadcast of "Morning in Kyeongseong" has arrived.
It has been determined that..
"Morning in Kyeongseong" is not a plagiarized script.
It's an original piece of work!
Without an ounce of suspicion, let's do our best for the first broadcast!
Understood, everyone?
!
Yes!
Such a crybaby.
Oh..
Thank you, Representative.
Don't be disorganized in the future.
Get your stuff copyrighted, take good care of all your files, and save back-ups.
Crying and laughing, way to make a scene.
Throw it away.
But it looks expensive.
Let's go together!
Aigoo, seriously! I'm in a skirt!
Stop acting like you're so clean.
I'm not.
You're just dirty.
What is this?
A.K?
Can't you tell by looking?
It's my name.
Ah..
Was your name Anthony from the very beginning?
I mean, even though your parents lived in the United States for so long. They're still Korean, so wouldn't they give you a Korean name?
No such thing.
My name was Anthony from the day I was born.
How can there be Anthony in a Korean name?
What do your parents think?
I never asked them.
Then call them and ask them.
They both passed a long time ago.
You don't need to feel sorry since I'm not concerned in any way.
Then should I give you a Korean name?
What would be good?
Kim..
Kim..
Ah!
How about 'Kim Young Man'?
You get insulted by a lot of people. So, short for Kim Yok Mani (lots of insults),
Kim Yong Man.
Are you having fun, messing with me?
Very much so.
40 Woo 6976...6976 Please, pull over... 40 Woo 6976...
Look here!
Aish!
Since it is your fault, cover the fine yourself.
I'm not the one driving, why do I have to pay?
You've ran a stoplight. Please show me your license.
Aigoo, you're working hard.
Since I have to attend an urgent matter and something like this won't happen again, can't you let us off this time?
Yes, please don't do it again.
- Thank you..
But give me your driver's license.
Your license has expired already. Requesting identity confirmation, requesting identity confirmation,
Resident Registration NO.: 741104-1675138.
The name, Kim Bong Dal?
Kim as in Kimchi, Bong as in bongos, and Dal as in Dallas.
Kim Bong Dal.
Aye, why is he saying that?
Kim Bong D... No freaking way!
Anthony is Kim Bong Dal... that's his real name!
Awesome...
For real?
Excuse me.
You said you didn't have a Korean name.
Kim Bong Dal.
I wonder if that's an American name too.
Kim Bong..
Dal~?
Don't laugh.
I'm sorry, but the name is so irresistible.
Kim as in Kimchi, Bong as in Bongos, [Bong means mountain top]
Dal as in Dallas.
[Dal means the moon.]
It's so funny!
I'm sorry but ...
It's too funny! Kimchi... Bongwoori (meaning "mountain peak"),
Daldeongee (meaning "round face like the moon"). So, November 4th is our Kim Bong Dal's birthday.
Yes, the door is not locked.
Yes...
You're surprised, aren't you?
It's just a joke!
Oh, oh my... I'm sorry.
You must have been so surprised.
I thought it was someone else.
Not at all.
Would you like to come in? I guess you've been writing the script, so I'm afraid if I'm interrupting now.
Not at all. Please have a seat.
I don't have anything but coffee, is that okay?
Yes.
What brought you here?
I came to apologize.
I'd like to apologize sincerely.
Misunderstanding about your script, that was my mistake.
No, I understand why you misunderstood. When I read that book,
I also thought that different people could come up with similar ideas.
If you think in that way, I'm thankful.
But, there's something I was curious about.
What's the relationship between you and Representative?
Was my question a bit odd?
I was curious about that from the beginning. Anthony Kim, the previous Representative of Empire Production, isn't a person who would wager everything he has on a newbie writer's drama.
What's up with you two?
No, there is nothing between the two of us, what do you mean, "relationship"?
I totally hate a man with that kind of style.
What kind of women in the world would like a man like him? Well, if we must put the word "relationship", "relationship" of a demon and an angel?
Pardon?
Just... a vicious representative of drama production company and an angel-like writer?
Something like that?
But why are you asking that?
No.
From now on, all of us must run for the highest rating of the first episode of "Morning in Kyeongseong" on November 5th!
Yes!
How are our competitors of other broadcasting stations going now?
Currently, "Return of the King" of K Broadcasting is running as the number one in ratings.
Followed by "Between Lovers" of M Broadcasting in the second.
Then, what about S Broadcasting?
Its drama is in last with one digit rating (under 10%).
I don't think we can get any advantage from the previous drama's rating.
Last Tuesday's rating was 6.2%.
It was the worst.
It seems we will have a hard fight.
Of course it will be hard, but no matter what, we will win.
From the day when Anthony took the position of Representative to 2009 when he resigned, these are accounting fraud books and the lobbying list which used the money from that accounting fraud.
All of them were instructed by you, Chairman, but all accounts and transactions were done under the name of Anthony.
Other than that, he didn't steal even a single penny from my money?
Yes.
That's unexpected.
Well, with these, he would be rotting in a prison for at least 10 years.
Contact our legal team and let them proceed.
Yes.
Yes, PD Kim.
I called you because I heard our "Morning in Kyeongseong" will be introduced at your "Entertainment Tonight".
Yes, yes.
Then, please take good care of that.
I've sent the revised script for episode 7.
Mr. Kim.
Bong.
Dal.
Yes, Mom.
Hey, we have big trouble.
Come quickly to our restaurant.
What's going on?
Can't you see?
There are so many customers here!
Aigo...
I can't do this by myself!
Mom!
Is that big trouble?
Of course, it is!
Top star, Kang Hyun Min is visiting here himself!
Mr. Kang Hyun Min?
Why are you here?
Why?
To promote Writer Lee's "Morning in Kyeongseong", I'm here.
They are from my fan club.
KANG HYUN MIN!
KANG HYUN MIN!
KANG HYUN MIN!
KANG HYUN MIN!
- Everyone!
- Yes! This person is the beautiful writer of our "Morning in Kyeongseong", Writer Lee Go Eun.
- Writer Lee.
- Yes.
Please say something. Please say something. Please say something.
Huh?
Ah... Yes...
Hello!
I'm Writer Lee Go Eun.
Nice to meet you all.
Our "Morning in Kyeongseong"
will be aired soon.
There are not many days left until its first episode.
Please promote our drama a lot.
Our "Morning in Kyeongseong" and here Mr.Kang Hyun Min, no, from now on, Kim Woo Jin (the role's name), you will give lots of love to them, right?
Yes!
But, seriously, why are you here?
I'm sorry for misunderstanding your drama, Writer Lee.
I thought that apologizing with only words wouldn't be enough.
So, you want to apologize with money and your fans?
Because I have nothing but only money and fans!
Then, I will get going for filming now.
Again, sorry! See you later!
Goodbye!
Yes, Representative?
You want me to amend all of the script for episode 7?
Not all of them but Scene 42 and Scene 43 with that clumsy melodrama part.
Clum...clumsy?
It even has the kiss scene of the main two characters, but where do you mean is it clumsy?
Writer Lee, when you kiss a man, are you doing it in this way?
Huh?
No, I mean, have you ever kissed a man?
I have!
Then, do it.
What?
!
In my eyes, the kiss scene in Scene 43 gives only the feeling of two wooden sticks hitting each other.
So, I'm telling you to try it yourself, Writer Lee.
Pardon?
PD Joo, read out loud Scene 43.
Well, everyone, let's see.
Scene 43, inside of Modern Club. Sad piano music is filling the empty club,
Kim Woo Jin is sitting alone in front of the piano and playing it.
At this moment, with tip-tap, tip-tap sound of high heels, a woman approaches Woo Jin.
What are you doing?
I told you to try it yourself.
Even if Woo Jin sensed Hye Rin coming near him, he doesn't stop playing. Hye Rin grabs his hand.
Woo Jin stops playing the piano.
Hye Rin speaks. "From now on, your playing piano, can you do it only for me?"
Woo Jin stays still, not taking his eyes off the piano.
Hye Rin speaks.
"Even if I lie to you, even if I .... even if I betray you, I'm asking if you can play the piano, only for me."
"No." After that, Woo Jin stands up, staring at Hye Rin, and kisses her?
Even that dumb Kang Hyun Min won't be able to grab Sung Min Ah and kiss her!
I'm not an actress, though!
A writer is supposed to write to make actors act!
If you feel so wronged, then go ahead, ask these male viewers what they think.
That's why you should revise it. I don't think it's because you don't like melodramas, but because you can't write them. PD Joo, contact the assistant director and tell him Scene 42 and Scene 43 will be revised, so he should proceed with the other scenes' filming, except for those scenes.
The reason...
Don't ask me why.
What I can do for you is...
Cut!
NG!
Min Ah, this is already the fourth NG. It's not a difficult line, but what's wrong?
I'm sorry, Director.
Then, let's take a 10-minute break!
We will resume after 10-minute break!
What are you doing, being so childish?
Then, what about you, Miss Sung Min Ah?
You childishly doubted Writer Lee, but have you apologized to her?
What's that with today's filming?
If you humiliated a person publicly, shouldn't you officially apologize to her in front of all of them?
I apologized to her officially, so please, stop that moronic act.
Mo~ron!
Moronic act?
That's right! You will keep experiencing that! This Kang Hyun Min's revenge, it's Season One, Two, Three, Four!
It will be continued!
Hyung, have you read the script for episode 7?
Why?
The revision has been made from episode 1, so the melodrama line starts sooner too.
Is that so?
There is even a kiss scene with Miss Sung Min Ah.
What?
Kissing scene?
Yeah.
But as per the assistant director, it will be revised.
Representative, then, we will go home now.
Okay, you've worked hard today.
Since tomorrow is our first air date, have a good sleep tonight.
You will need to run around all day, tomorrow.
Yes, I understand!
We will leave, then.
Scene#43, Inside of Modern Club.
What?
I can't even kiss?
Should I experience a kiss to write well about a kiss scene?
Then, what about a story about a serial killer? Its writer should be a serial killer?
How absurd it is...
Hello.
Excuse me ... Ah, because of that damn Kim Bong Dal, I can't focus on the right feeling.
Kim Bong Dal's Birthday!
What is it?
Didn't you go home?
I have some business to do with you, Representative.
Business?
Anthony, Anthony, Anthony~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday, dear Representative!
Happy birthday to you~~!
Representative, happy birthday!
What are you doing now?
Today is your birthday, Representative.
Your ID number...
Kimchi, Bongwoori ("peak"), Daldeongee ("moon face")!
I'm sorry, but can't you see I'm working now?
Stop interrupting and get out, please.
That's what I'm saying!
Geez. Maybe today isn't his birthday.
That's weird, because I heard it clearly.
Maybe he had something bad earlier.
Is he sulking now? Anyway, I'm sorry!
No.
What are you sorry for?
We'll escort you to your studio.
Ah, really?
- Yes. - Oh, we're mannered guys.
Alright!
By the way, what are they about, Kimchi, Bongwoori, Dalmaji ("viewing the moon")?
No, it's Daldeongee ("Moon face")!
Can I meet you now?
I will wait at the cafe.
Happy birthday!
It's the ring, which you cherished as if it was your life because you believed it protected your success.
It won't be exactly same as that one, but it will look almost same.
Please make sure to succeed with this drama too.
Thank you, but I'd like to decline this present.
Please just accept it.
I'm sorry but this one... can't be that ring.
It's the ring, which you cherished as if it was your life because you believed it protected your success.
Don't worry about me.
Even when you're in the States, don't skip your meals, and take good care of your health.
Understand?
Mom ...
What?
Your attention, please.
Passengers for New York, ... Oh, dear. You'd better go now.
I will go, then.
He-hey!
This is your father's ring.
Take this ring.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
Hurry up, go!
It seems you're busy these days. Today she was anticipating you more than usual, wanting to stay up until late, and just went to bed.
Did you have some seaweed soup?
[Seaweed soup is traditionally eaten on b-days]
Weren't you asleep?
I'm sorry.
I should have taken care of it but since my body's like this.
That's why you have to quickly get up and leave this place.
So that you can cook seaweed soup for me.
Right.
I have to.
Since I saw your face, it's okay now.
You must be busy.
Hurry and leave.
Be careful when you leave.
I look forward to the first broadcast tomorrow.
It'll go well, don't worry too much.
You are your mom's son.
Finally, it's tomorrow.
my new destiny will start.
Will I be smiling at the end of that destiny?
I'll be able to smile.
No, I just hope that I will be able to smile.
Today, the food is free in celebration of 'Morning in Kyeongseong's' first broadcast!
Welcome!
Today, the food is on me!
Yes, it's all free!
The day we've all been waiting for, the first broadcast day of "Morning in Kyeongseong," has finally arrived.
Send the press release materials to all media venues, as we have to let the whole country know about the premier of our drama!
Yes, understood!
Revise the final trailer and get it aired starting 9 hours before the premier.
Include scenes that haven't been relased so far...
I think that'd be better.
Here it is.
Ok, start music here.
Team Leader Han, make sure that the entertainment news show, that airs tonight, goes smoothly.
Lastly, each of you can leave a message to the viewers throughout the country.
Dear Viewers, 'Morning in Kyeongseong', the show you've been waiting for will have its first broadcast tonight at 9:55.
Yes, I hope that many of you will watch it.
Fighting!
This concludes the coverage of "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Have you had dinner?
Good work people.
It's a wrap for today.
Tonight, let's all enjoy the first episode in the comfort of our own respective homes.
Ah, time is so slow.
How many more minutes?
30 minutes.
What?
30 minutes.
Are you really not going to watch the first episode?
Unni, you know about my jinx.
If I watch the first episode, the viewership rating sucks.
ok, I understand.
- I'm leaving, rest well
- Yes.
Why did you want me to come all the way here?
Monitor the live viewership ratings along with your script of the episode.
See for yourself what element excites the viewers and what makes them change the channel.
From now on until the 20th episode, you are breathing with the viewers.
You're here?
Representative Kim, congratulations.
You've made a comeback after 3 years.
I'll accept that after 70 minutes.
Sure.
Congratulaitons, writer Lee.
Finally, you've become a real writer.
Thank you.
Broadcasting in 3 minutes.
Watch that viewership rating graph carefully.
The life and death of all of us is on that line of destiny.
2 minutes.
1 minute.
In a few minutes, the drama my daughter wrote will be on.
10 seconds.
5seconds 4,3 ,2 ,1 Start! 4,3 ,2 ,1 Start!
We have a start with 7.1%
Not a great start.
What do we do? It's been 30 minutes, and it's at 6.8%.
We're still the lowest.
Where are you going?
It's still in the middle of the broadcast!
It's all over.
It's only been 30 minutes since the show started.
Half an hour has passed already and the rating is in the pits.
We have lost.
In total misery.
So you're here.
That's why I told you. We need to go for melodrama, not Noir.
Ajummah, can I get a glass here, too?
What are you doing?
I'm going to drink too.
Go work on your script.
I want to be alone.
Thank you.
Representative Kim.
The show just finished.
I suppose.
The average viewership rating has been calculated.
Speak.
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
The viewership rating result is in?
We must have had a spike towards the end.
Viewership rating is 15.7%.
We're in the lead!
Oh my!
15.7!
This is awesome!
We've hit it off big!
- Congratulations!
- Jackpot!
Jackpot!
Congratulations!
This is just the beginning.
Awesome!
We're first!
15.7%
- 15.7% - Thanks, Lord!
Yes?
15.7%?
First?
Oh my!
Yes, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you 'Morning in Kyeongseong' would be a success?
I'm Anthony after all.
Where are you going?
I should go work on the script with this energy!
Forget the script, tonight you should drink!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Finally the era of Kang Hyun Min has started.
Conquer Korea, then Japan, China, Taiwan, and then the whole world!
Didn't I tell you we'd definitely be success?
Tch!
Don't you remember what you just said a while ago?
What did I tell you?
We shouldn't have gone with Noir.
When did I?
At any rate, I think this is meaningful in so many different ways.
Especially that we got the highest rating with a genre that hadn't been attempted in Korea before. Of course, the producer's eye in discerning the right script was especially crucial.
What about the promising writer's writing skills with tenacity?
You sure are a promising writer, but you still have a long way to go.
At any rate, a drama writer needs to know how to write good melodrama.
Nothing like that pathetic kissing scene.
That talk again! Tell me truthfully, you've never had a kiss right?
That of cours-
You haven't felt your heart beating for a man.
I've felt it before.
Not just a childish crush.
I've definitely,
You've definitely not experienced that.
Seriously, aren't you drinking a little too much?
You were already drinking before I came here.
I'm Anthony.
Mere alcohol can't defeat me.
PD Joo, where are you?
Eh?
Soowon?
It's nothing.
Well, it's just... no, never mind.
Ah man, ah, darn!
Mere alcohol what?
Can't defeat me?
Seriously!
I guess... it's my fault... for drinking with him.
Sleep well. [dropping the honorifics]
Don't ever drink again!
What do you think about me?
Yes?
How do you think of me as a man?
See you tomorrow~ Preview So what you two are saying right now..
..is that you have a problem with the kiss scene in episode 7? That's right.
You are under arrest for professional negligence and misappropriation of funds.
Exactly why do you hate me so much?
I'll kill you.
Stop sabotaging the production of "Morning in Kyeonseong," alread!
Please! How dare you order me around?
If you've got a nice lady friend, you can bring her to me.
I'll show you when I find one.
What have you been doing all those years without ever dating a boyfriend?
How I hate him, hate him.
The mother of Mr. Kim Bong Dal is seriously ill.
Mo, mother?
Mom!
Mom!
Episode 12 No enemy is permanent How do you think of me as a man? Well...
This is called "melodrama". This heartbeating, fluttering, this is "melodrama" right there! So, now, go and revise that melodrama scene.
What was that? That scared me... What kind of human being is he?
Seriously!
What do you think about me?
How do you think of me as a man?
What man?
But why couldn't I say no at that moment?
No.
That was because I was toyed in a flash.
That's right.
Crazy Bong Dal...
So embarrassing!
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's me.
What's this?
What is he doing here?
Why are you here?
I have something to say, so open the door first.
What do you have to say?
You didn't answer me before.
Huh?
How do you think of me as a man?
I'm thinking of you in this way.
Oh, that was a relief. (because it was a dream.)
What's a relief?
What time do you think it is now that you're still in bed?
Since when have you been here?
Since a little while ago.
When I came in, you were pawing the air as if you were a turtle which was flipped over.
Even if you are the producer, how could you come in a female writer's studio thoughtlessly?
This is a writer's studio paid by my money and opened by me.
But that writer didn't even answer the phone call and didn't show any reaction to the door because she was too busy sleeping.
So, what else can I do, then?
If you need to sleep that much, do you think you can survive in this drama industry?
Why did you come?
Hurry and revise the melodrama scene of episode 7 and send it to us.
We need to film that scene on this Thursday.
I will revise that scene!
Do it quickly! Well!
Get out!
Even if you don't tell me to go, I will leave.
And from now on, even if you're sleeping, when I call you, answer it.
Because I don't want to see you pawing the air when I'm so busy.
Ah, seriously... "Morning in Kyeongseong", from the first episode, wins Monday-Tuesday.
Woo hoo~ "Morning in Kyeongseong", from the first episode, wins Monday-Tuesday.
"Kang Hyun Min's charisma was shining."
"Indeed, it was Kang Hyun Min, just like everybody said."
[Sung Min Ah, her comeback drama after 3 years shows its signal of success."
Min Ah, what are you doing?
Oh, you're here.
What?
"Morning in Kyeongseong", the pioneer of new drama genre." Catching two birds and great harmony between a veteran director and a newbie writer.
"Writer Lee Go Eun, I've never heard of her name, but she's the best!" "Even if she's a newbie, her writing is awesome!"
Then, let's proceed with it accordngly.
You've worked hard! You've work hard. Well, and this one has not only a good rating, but also the reaction (from the viewers) is really great.
It went so viral. This drama hit the jackpot, jackpot!
Did it? Well, I think, our Writer Lee Go Eun, don't you think we should start managing her? (meaning "keeping her")
Do you know what people on the internet say about Lee Go Eun?
They say "the next Writer Kim Soo Hyun (one of the best Korean drama writers)".
I think we should give her at least a present or something.
What kind of present do you think would be good?
- A present?
- Yes!
CP Lee.
- Let's calm down a little bit, please.
- Calm down?
I will leave now.
So, not a present, but calm down?
Hello?
Is this Writer Lee Go Eun?
Yes. Who is it?
Hello.
This is Reporter Kim Eun Hee from Woo Ri Daily Newspaper.
I called you because I'd like to have an interview.
Interview?
With whom?
With you, Writer Lee.
You want to have an interview with me?
Yes, Reporter Kim.
Yes.
But, can I pick the place? (to have an interview)
Is there any special reason you picked this place?
Yes.
Because "Morning in Kyeongseong" started from this place.
- Here?
- Yes.
When I was living here, I came up with its idea and wrote its first draft.
Then, this is the most perfect place to have an interview with you, Writer Lee. After the first episode of "Morning in Kyeongseong" was aired, its reaction (from the viewers) was very good.
Who is the first one you think of or you are grateful of?
Of course it's my mom, Mrs. Park Kang Ja.
If it weren't for my mom, I wouldn't have been able to write again.
- Your Mother?
- Yes.
Oh, and there is one more person.
Who else? Even if that person has really bad personality and is heartless, because this guy made me go through so much hardship, but if it weren't that person, "Morning in Kyeongseong" couldn't have been born.
Who is that person?
Mr. Kim Bong Dal.
How does it feel to be outside?
It has been a while since you had fresh air.
I feel so good.
I can hear the sound of spring coming, too.
The sound of spring coming?
For spring to come, we still have to wait for a long time. Like the sound of spring coming,
I can hear the sound of some welcome guest coming.
That drama was really enjoyable.
If you think it's enjoyable, then it's really enjoyable.
It's rating is really good, too.
You've worried a lot, haven't you?
Me?
No.
From the beginning, I knew it would be successful.
Whatever your son makes will be the best, so don't worry at all. Don't work too hard like that, and if you have a good girl, you should show her to me, too. Even if I can't see her, if I hear her voice,
I will be able to know how good a woman she is.
If I have, I will show her to you, then.
Umm.. For a while, even if you're busy, please come visit her often.
Even though she doesn't show it, her condition has been quite bad these days.
Yes, I understand.
Yes.
Yes, speaking.
This is Prosecutor Kim Dong Chan from the Taxation Investigation Unit of Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office.
There is a complaint filed against you, so you should come now.
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
I'm saying you've been summoned.
Unless you want to be humiliated in front of your family, COME HERE RIGHT AWAY! So, you're saying you can't admit all the charges described here?
Yes, that's right.
But, according to the materials we've received, the evidence is pretty clear.
From 2006, 2007 and... until 2009.
See for yourself.
It seems like the material submitted by Empire Production.
Even all the little details about you are described. I understand how you feel now, but let's proceed with it simply not dragging too much time.
Please let me have a cross-examination with Oh Jin Wan, the accuser.
Come in!
A little while ago, Anthony was summoned to the Prosecutor's office and interrogated.
As you wish, I will arrange the cross-examination with the accuser, so see you next time.
Yes, PD Joo.
Yes, Representative.
Were you occupied, by any chance?
I couldn't reach you for a while.
It was nothing.
But why (did you look for me)?
Well, I called you to ask if you want to see today's episode at the broadcasting control room again.
Of course, I should be there.
Who is it?
It's delivery service.
Are you Lee Go Eun?
Yes.
Please take this.
Yes.
Could you sign here, please?
Here you go.
Work hard. Yes.
WriterLeeGo Eun!
Cheeringforyouforever!
[CP Lee Sung Jo]
I guess you really like that gift?
Oh, you came?
Man, he's so shallow.
Look how his attitude towards you has changed overnight.
But, why are you here?
Why do you think I'm here?
To congratulate you on getting the lead in ratings.
Congratulations for you.
Please come in.
Essentially, the viewership rating went up right at that moment.
A vertical spike!
What is it that you want to tell me?
Huh?
"Tell you"?
What do you mean?
That's the way it always is.
You always ask me for some favor when you come.
It's alright, you can say it. Hey,
I really came just to congratulate you.
I said it's alright.
What is it this time?
About the kiss scene...
Isn't it rather awkward?
It's like putting two stick figures together.
I'm working on a revision anyway,
Oh really!
Of course!
I knew it!
Seriously, didn't I tell you that there's no need to worry, Gwang Soo? I mean, I was ok, but he was losing sleep over it because he was worried for me, so my heart beat went beep.
We shouldn't be sitting around here.
Let's get out.
Where to?
I'll buy you a gift.
A Gift?
I have noticed that your.. winter wardrobe seems rather... lacking.
Let's go out.
I'll buy you a warm, cozy winter jumper.
You want to buy me a winter jumper?
Yes. I'll buy it.
Whatever you want.
As much as I want?
Anything you want!
Take your pick!
Go ahead!
Thank you. Thank you.
Do you have this in size 100?
That color is not good.
This is the newest!
This one!
Actually, I don't like to wear something unless it's from the newest line.
Mr. Hee Jae, I heard that this winter is going to be warm.
It looks too warm.
Up to how many can I get for free with the sponsorship?
Just two.
Darn it...!
We have a good start from the get go.
I think the second episode will have an even higher rating!
In the end... that was what you wanted?
Just do as I say.
Cut!
That's a wrap.
Listen, our show is being aired just fine, so let's focus on our work!
Good job.
Thisshissallbecoz.... Brrrrrr. Brrrr, ah, man, my tongue is stiff.
I'm so sorry.
Ah. Let's do it again.
Why did my tongue get so stiff?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
This is all all...*cough* Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, I feel bad.
It's winter, you know.
This is all becox of your....
Man, I forgot my line!
I'm sorry.
Ah, Ms. Ji Yeon, what is my next line? Do you know? Min Ah, are your knees ok?
Yes, I'm okay.
I can tolerate this much.
I'm really sorry.
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?
Sorry, Min Ah.
Search for it over there.
Yes.
Are you alright? Oops.. I'm sorry, Director!
My hand was freezing, so I guess I aimed wrong. I'm sorry! Well, if you can, for the hitting scene, let's go without an NG.
Yes.
Ready...
Action!
Oh, what should I do?
I guess my hand is still freezing, what should I do...?
Oh, I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry.
Let's go again.
Oh, what was my next line?
Ji Yeon!
What was my next line?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
What on earth is the reason you're doing this to me?
Cut!
Okay!
That was good!
Hyun Min!
Are you alright?
Sure, I'm fine!
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?
Oh, it's swollen, so red!
What should we do...?
Good work!
Good work!
We'll move to the next location in 30 minutes.
Okay.
I can see you're drooling.
By the way, that person, I've never seen her before.
She is the new FD.
Ah, FD... [Meet Writer Lee Go Eun of "Morning of Kyeongseong", the new drama in the news.]
".... and she expressed her gratitude to Mr. Kim Bong Dal as well." Representative, the photo of Writer Lee looks really great, doesn't it?
Well, just so-so.
By the way, who do you think would be that Kim Bong Dal?
Who knows.
But, isn't his name so funny?
These days, people don't use such a rustic name.
Kim Bong Dal...?
Koo Hee Jae.
Yes.
Don't concern about other people's names, and do your job driving properly.
Yes.
In a situation of divergent love, they're kissing...
Kiss... By grabbing her hand, Woo Jin stops her from leaving.
How do you think of me as a man?
The door is not locked.
Ah, one sec...
What is that?
That dumb expression?
What's wrong with my expression?
Aren't you curious?
About what?
What do you mean "what"?
The rating for episode 2, I mean.
Ah, how was it?
16.2%. We're still the highest, but with the second highest, the difference is only 0.8%, so don't loosen up yet.
Yes.
Did you revise that kiss scene?
Yes, of course.
How is it?
It's okay.
From now on, do it well on your own.
Pardon?
What have you done so far, not having dated anyone?
Well, I guess no man would stick around to put up with all your bad temper.
Ah, from now on, if you're grateful, say it to me personally.
Don't beat around the bush by saying it to a reporter.
Geez, that guy...
He really makes me not like him.
Does it hurt a lot?
Yes, it hurts crazily.
Is that wench crazy?
What face does she think she deals with... seriously...
Oppa.
Huh? Your cheek went in further, so your chin looks even longer.
What?
No... Sung Min Ah, this fox-like wench!
By the way, Hyung.
What? I received the revised script, but its kiss scene seems even stronger now.
What?
"... kisses her."
Oppa!
You said there is no kiss scene!
Kwang Soo.
Get ready with the car.
Pardon?
Where are you going?
Are you asking that because you don't know? So, when they said it would be revised, they meant that she's writing the kiss scene better.
With that moron?
Give me the phone.
"The number you called isn't available at the moment..." Then, about the funds he snuck out, are you saying you have no knowledge, Mr. Oh Jin Wan?
Yes.
I had no knowledge of it. Sunbaenim, why don't you tell him the truth?
All that money, what did you do with that?
Prosecutor.
Chief Prosecutor wants you to call him.
I got it.
Let's take a short break.
What on earth do you think you're doing now?
As if you don't know.
You would know well that I wouldn't die alone.
Where and when I used that money, do you want me to spill it all out?
Try it, then.
Because I've already got rid of all evidence of that money being used for lobbying.
And there is no evidence it was done by Chairman's instruction.
What we have are only the traces of transactions of all that money in your bank account.
Why on earth... do you hate me so much?
If this is because of all humiliation I've given you...
Humiliation...
No.
You wouldn't know how it feels even if you came back from death. [dropping the honorifics]
Director Oh, Director Oh... Even if I was called so sickly and treated even less than a bug, such things can still be erased. However, because your bulls**tting philosophy that you should even abandon your father for a drama,
As long as that moment, that memory remains in my brain, you...
I'm going to kill you.
Well, then, let's stop this cross-examination.
You can go back now.
Wait. Where do you think you're going?
For dereliction of duty and embezzlement, you're arrested without warrant. Until the warrant is approved, for the next 48 hours, you can't leave this office, not even a step. Ah, these days, because of that guy, I had a big headache, but thanks to you, I'm relieved now.
Yes, please take good care of this case.
Yes.
Arrested without a warrant?
Why is that all of a sudden?
That's why you should have minded your behaviors.
I asked you why!
Can't you tell just by looking at this?
You're in a serious bind right now.
Even if you had to part ways with him, you shouldn't have done that to your superior.
Hey, Kim Joo Yong!
It's been a while.
Yes, what's going on?
Oh, end-of-the-year gathering? Well, actually, currently, at my district prosecutor's office, the representative of the production company of one of your dramas has been arrested without a warrant.
Arrested without a warrant?
Who from our dramas?
"Morning in Kyeongseong," sounded like it's still going on.
"Morning of Kyeongseong"?
Is Representative Kim there?
Yes, but I don't think he'll be released easily.
Seems like there was an order from the higherups.
Someone must be behind all this.
Okay...
Thanks.
She'd said she'd revise it... how dare she make a fool of me?
!
Hyung we're here.
Oh, why are you here?
Why?
Do you have to ask? So, let me get this straight, both of you have issues with the kissing scene in episode 7?
That's right.
-That's right.
But both of you knew that there will be some romance later in the story. Although they realize that they love each other more than anybody, they have to be enemies, so this is a pivotal turning point for these two characters.
That's what makes it all the more tragic.
A kiss doesn't make it more tragic, though, To leave it as tragic, they should just stare at each other.
Which we can pull off well enough with our acting skills.
Exactly!
At any rate, change it like that.
Without the kiss.
After revising the previous draft because it was considered too bland, I can't do that.
Who said that?
I mean, who said that it's bland? Well, I'm not saying that I revised it because of one person's opinion, but I also thought it was bland after all, so I ended up revising it. Also, if, by any chance, this is because you don't get along with each other, I'll be seriously disappointed.
Unni, do we not get a long? [dropping the honorifics]
I wouldn't say we don't. [Still uses honorifics]
What does the director say?
No matter what the director says, I can't do it.
No, I won't.
Don't change your word later.
We have to be persistent to the end.
Just make sure that you don't change your words.
Don't worry.
I also have no desire to kiss you.
Well then, that's good. If I could avoid kissing that firefox,
I'd gladly swim in the ocean again! If I have to kiss that moron, I'd rather have my character shot dead so I can quit the drama.
So, Hyung, do you think Writer Lee will revise it?
After all, you did end up swimming in the ocean.
Jesus Christ!
No way!
Moron
Yes? I'd like to share from my experience of ending up swimming in the ocean, if we really want to avoid the kiss scene, we have to present an appropriate alternative.
Alternative?
For example, we could make the revision ourselves and give it to her.
That's not a bad idea.
This one, this one, this one, this one! Take out "he kisses her," and change it to "Woojin gazes at her."
Well, that doesnt work with the flow of the movement from the earlier scene.
You also have to take out the "He grabs her hand and stops her from leaving."
Then, how is he going to gaze at her?
Just blankly?
Can't you pull it off with your acting skills?
Well, I have to see you to try acting.
Then, why don't we each fix our own parts.
Okay, fine. I got it. I'm hanging up.
Good.
That idiot.
Darn, that vixen.
Man, if she's going to do it anyway, why doesn't she fix mine, too...
Jesus Christ.
Oh, Writer Lee.
Your revision of the kiss scene is great!
But, Representative Kim isn't here?
No. He left in the morning.
What is it?
Nothing, just wondering why I couldn't reach him.
Let's not waste any more time here.
No matter what, you'll end up in prison.
Just fess up everything so that your sentence can get reduced at least, Mr. Stiff-Neck!
Man, what is he doing with his phone turned off all day?
Yes, Director, this is Writer Lee.
Could I see you for a moment?
"No matter what the director says, I can't do it?"
"No, I won't?"
No, that's not it, Director. That's...
I didn't know you were such a snitch, Writer Lee.
Excuse me?
A snitch? Director... In the end, what you're saying is that you absolutely can't do the kiss scene.
That's correct. I'm really sorry, but I just can't do it, Director.
Yes, me too. Fine, if you have to have things your way, then I'll do things my way, too.
You know about my past, right?
If I say I quit, I do quit!
And once I get started on something, there's no stopping me. The past five years, I was drowning in wine, ruining my life, then turned around to work really hard on a drama.
Once I drink this, I have no idea what might become of me.
What are you going to do?
Can you do it or not?
The taste of wine is dragging me back to alcoholism.
Director!
Director!
I'll do it.
And you, Min Ah? I'll do it, but, I can't drink any alcohol, Director.
Then go and have a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow we have a full schedule ahead!
I understand.
I'm leaving.
Ah, really how can you keep drinking?
You have a drink too.
Refreshing cassia seed tea is good for your health.
What?
Cassia seed tea?
Oh!
This really isn't alcohol.
Ah, you really shocked me!
This is what it means to be "seasoned."
It's good! Someone was so confident about not changing his mind, but I shouldn't have trusted someone's words.
Then what about you?
Who suggested it first?
You'd better brush your teeth properly (before filming the kiss scene).
Four times per day!
You'd better have your teeth scaled!
The Representative hasn't come back yet? Yes, his cell phone is still turned off, so I was worried and waiting for him, but now I'm about to go home.
He has never been like this before.
Representative?
Ah, yes...
Who?
I'm sorry but there is no one named Kim Bong Dal in this company.
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I guess you dialed the wrong number.
Hold on, PD Joo.
Hold on, please.
Hello.
Hello, this is from Chamsomang Sanatorium.
Sanatorium?
Yes.
Is there anyone named Kim Bong Dal?
Ah, if you tell me what you called for, I will leave the message for him.
I called because Mr. Kim Bong Dal's mother is in critical condition now.
Mo... His mother?
Yes. Please tell him he must come now.
Well, wait a moment, where is your sanatorium?
Okay.
What is the reason you came to visit me?
Regarding the prosecutor's investigation about Representative Kim, which is currently happening, please halt it right away.
I didn't know that you cherished Anthony that much, Director Nam.
No!
Stop trying to sabotage the production of "Morning of Kyeongseong," please!
How dare you order me to stop...
Father!
It has already been for 20 years that you didn't acknowledge me as your father, shutting me off.
But now, are you taking sides with that bastard who backstabbed your father?
I got it.
Then, not as your son, but as Director of SBC Drama Department, please let me rephrase it. Your contemptible action, Mr.Chairman, then can you stop doing this? Anthony, that bastard has also lived in the way which you are contemptuous of, so he's just purged of that sin.
That's all.
Purged of the sin?
Then, do you think you're not guilty?
What?
Please stop.
Okay?
And also... as you said, I've been shutting you off for last 20 years. But if you still have thoughts of me as your son, and if you don't want to lose your one and only son forever, please stop, I beg you.
Yes.
Huh?
!
I understand.
Let's do that.
You... You're really capable, I guess. I don't know why, but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind.
The charges are dropped, and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened.
Ah, yes, I'm really sorry to bother you for this.
Sometime soon, I'll arrange a meeting.
Let's have dinner together.
Ah, yes... Yes, then...
Let me ask you just one thing.
What is the reason you tried to protect that bastard?
Please let me tell you once again.
What I want to protect is only the drama "Morning of Kyeongseong", which I'm in charge of as Director of Drama Department. And also, your interruption in my drama by using that dirty trick, I hope that never happens again from now on.
Fine.
But you should know this one thing at least. That dirty trick you're talking about, you also had benefits from it.
How do you think you became Director, despite your lack of faction or connections?
What... what are you talking about?
That's right.
That position was also given to you by your father's power, which you despise so much!
Anthony is released?
What are you saying?
!
I heard that the case is closed now.
I think that Chairman ordered to drop the charges.
The Chairman?
It's me, Mr. Chairman.
I don't know what to say to express my gratitude.
You'd better thank Director Nam Woon Hyeong.
How do you think you became Director, despite your lack of faction or connections?
That position was also given to you by your father's power, which you despise so much!
What brings you here at this late hour, Representative Kim?
I came to say thank you. Well, I don't know what you've heard or where, but I just did what I could do for my drama.
but I just did what I could do for my drama.
But can I ask you how you resolved it?
I don't think I have to tell you about that.
Yeah.
Yes?
Yes, it's me.
Huh?
Mom...
Mom!
How did this happen?
This afternoon, her condition suddely became critical.
But luckily, the critical moment is gone, and now she's stable.
So, you don't need to worry so much.
Are you ok?
I didn't know your mother was still alive.
Why did you say it like that before?
That she had passed away.
I... really hated them.
Our extreme poverty, my father who abandoned me as soon as I was born, whose face I've never seen, and even my mother who is blind.
I hated them all and was ashamed of them.
When I got to the USA, I made a resolution.
That I will forget everything that happened in Korea. From now on, I'm Anthony, I don't know anything about poverty, and I grew up in the States, I'm Anthony.
And that's what I told everybody, too. That my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance.
That I grew up with a happy childhood.
I'm... a big coward.
What's the next scene?
Kim Woo Jin and Jin Hye Rin's kissing scene.
Is it?
And the actors?
A kissing scene with that moron?
Just thinking about it makes me sick!
Min Ah, just close your eyes and get over with it, please?
What else can we do at this point?
Hyung.
Do you really have to go that far?
Affawhashiditamelashtime?
(After what she did to me last time?
)
Afcarshahaftagothishfar.
(Of course I have to go this far.)
Afcarsh.
(Of course.)
If you are ready, you may come out.
From now on, can you play the piano only for me?
Even if I were to betray you?
Even if I were to deceive you?
Could you still play it only for me?
Cut!
Ah, Min Ah, what's wrong?
You were doing so well!
Go brush your teeth before I throw a fit. [Dropping the honorifics]
Yes, Noona.
I knew you'd say that.
"Is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for?"
"Of course, it's my mom. Mrs. Park Kang Ja."
Of course, of course it's your mom.
Who else but your mom?
By the way, mom...
What is it?
There is someone I know... whose past is so full of pain that he can't get over it...
Sure, there are people like that.
He wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she's alive.
Does that make him a bad person?
Of course that makes him a bad person.
Then why the heck would someone not think of him as a bad person?
Well, that means that someone likes that person.
Why?
Is this about you?
No!
It's for my drama.
So cold. Aunty, I've come for some grilled mackerels!
Oh!
Welcome!
And that's what I told other people, too.
That my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance. That I grew up with a happy childhood.
I'm... a big coward...
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't reach you at all all day yesterday.
Did something happen?
Nothing really.
You did that back then, too.
Five years ago, when you broke up with me and left.
Like yesterday, I couldn't reach you at all all of a sudden. After transforming the rookie actress Sung Min Ah into the goddess of melodramas, you deserted me, leaving as if you were running away.
I've told you already.
I've erased all my memories of you.
Don't lie.
Though you may not have had started out that way, towards the end, you ended up loving me.
Yes, I admit that I did like you.
Then, why did you leave?
You're an actress who should be loved by everybody. If that's the only reason, don't leave me ever again.
Episode 14 From Dusk till Dawn Ready, action! FIRE!
Hye Rin! Ahjussi,youcan'tsleephere ! FIRE!
Cut! Hyun Min, what's wrong? Director!
There's someone inside!
I SAID THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE!
What now?
Eariler there was an extra inside, maybe he wasn't feeling well.
Ahjussi!
That Ahjussi earlier with the carrier.
The Ahjussi I replaced, I don't see him anywhere.
The fire truck?
It should... arrive soon.
No, Representative!
Representative!
Ahjussi, are you alright?
Come to your senses! Wake up!
We have to get out!
Get on my back!
No, director, you can't!
Let go of me.
People getting hurt at my set...
I can't just stand around and watch!
Representative!
Are you alright?
I'm alright.
We should worry about that person.
What's with all of you?
Like people who were wishing that I wouldn't get out.
Don't tell me... You weren't crying, right?
What crying?
All the smoke is blowing in my direction, it's killing my eyes.
Representative, are you okay?
I'm okay.
What about the other person?
They're doing first aid for now, his condition seems to be rather severe.
How is his blood pressure?
180.
How much?
97.
Move him to intensive care!
Yes.
Where is the hospital?
I have to go there as well.
The director said the actors and staff shouldn't come.
and just stand by near here.
He will contact us.
What are you thinking about?
The extra who died on my set on that day, 5 years ago...
That day comes up again and again in my memory.
5 years earlier.
What do we do?
!
You bastard!
Bring my son back to life!
I'm telling you to bring him back!
My precious son!
Bring him back...
Where are you going?
For now, don't look for me.
Thenwhataboutmydrama?
Now my drama is finished.
Forever.
Hm, Mom.
Did the staff like it?
They all said it's really delicious and complimented your cooking skills.
And were really grateful.
Yes? But why does your voice sound so frail?
But why does your voice sound so frail?
Did something happen?
No.
Work is going well, so don't worry too much.
Don't get too hung up on the script without sleping, and take it easy.
Don't overwork.
Yes, I'll do that.
Hello!
Go Eun!
Mom, I'll give you a call later on.
Kang Hyun Min.
I was worried...
How is he?
He just went into intensive care, we're all waiting for him to wake up.
Actually, I was surprised. I'm sorry to you for thinking this way, but that you would come here yourself,
I would never have imagined it.
It's what I should do.
You must be tired, you can go and wash up.
You don't have to worry because I'm here.
Writer!
It was my fault.
What?
What does that...
I... saw him. No, no, no.
Bit Na... She's the lead actress, so I have to act with her.
How can we film seperately?
Anyways, I'm a little busy so I'll call you later.
I'm hanging up.
What a scare!
Ahjussi!
You can't sleep here.
Hey, Bit Na, if you're going to be like this I'm going to get mad!
Got it?
Back then, if I... had only woken him up...
No...
If I had called another person... it wouldn't have turned out like that.
Don't blame yourself too much.
You couldn't have imagined the situation would be like this.
No one could.
Even so... If only I had given it a little thought this wouldn't have happen.
Aigoo.
I fully understand what you're feeling.
Don't think about it this negatively.
Because that man can get up again.
Really?
Of course. Everyone is praying single-heartedly, so it will turn out well.
So cheer up. Kang Hyun Min style.
My style?
Korea's top star Kang Hyun Min, Your Highness' style.
Like Brad Pitt?
Yes, like Brad Pitt.
Why did you come here?
He said he came because he was worried.
How is he?
Externally he has minor burns, the problem are internal injuries of the lung.
Fotunately the internal injuries are also minor.
Go inside, have a look.
He regained consciousness a while ago.
Are you feeling alright?
Thank you so much, Representative.
If it wasn't for you...
I wouldn't have remained alive.
Get well fast.
Once this drama is finished, you have to do the ninth drama with us as well.
Then. I'll have to get up fast.
Min Ah!
They said he's conscious!
He woke up?
Yes, and there are no major injuries.
Ah... That such a relief.
I'll be at the car.
Take your time to get ready and come out.
Okay, got it.
Representative, no!
Don't tell me... You weren't crying, right?
What crying?
All the smoke is blowing in my directions, it's killing my eyes.
Representative! - Ah, Team Leader.
You were looking for me?
Give him enough money for him to get proper treatment until he fully recovers.
Yes.
Also quickly prepare the compensation so he can receive it soon.
Make sure it to be enough, not lacking.
Yes, I got it. Make sure it to be enough, not lacking.
What?
Ah, nothing.
Representative, today... you were totally cool.
Representative, are you alright?
Shouldn't you be examined as well?
You don't look good.
How can I look good?
I went into a fire pit and came out.
I'm okay, so don't worry.
Representative Kim!
Thank you.
Now did those 5-year-old memories disperse a little?
Anthony.
You're a pretty okay producer.
It took you this long to realize that?
How disappointing.
Right.
Then I'm sorry.
Now you'd better get back to the set and finish the shoot.
Isn't it the last scene?
Right.
Please look after the situation over here.
Hyun Min, let's go!
Don't we have to shoot the last scene? Of course we have to shoot it!
That little bastard Kang Hyun Min has changed quite a lot.
He did, didn't he?
But it's not as much as the change of "someone".
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about "someone" who was the original cold-blooded asshole but now suddenly changed to a nice guy.
Tell me.
Why did you run into the fire?
Huh?
Everybody was at a loss, not knowing what to do, but why did you run into the fire despite its danger?
I just went inside.
Just like that?
Didn't you say you sold your soul to the devil?
Kim Bong Dal.
The soul Anthony sold - Kim Bong Dal bought it back, cheaply.
So you have returned.
You as well.
Cut!
Okay!
We're done for tonight!
Well, today, you all did a great job.
Tomorrow there is no shoot, so rest well.
Let's get back to Seoul!
Well done!
I can't do that, Director. On a good day like today let's have a get-together!
Everyone, today's get-together is on Kang Hyun Min!
Kwang Soo.
This is for the staff. Don't eat it.
I'm staff, too.
You punk, get to cooking'.
The meat is done.
Enjoy your meal.
Enjoy!
Thank you.
Let's have a drink.
Thanks.
Writer Lee!
This is also sponsored, isn't it?
No, it isn't. I'm paying for it all.
So, the meat is done. The hero of today who made sure that we can continue shooting in safety is our Representative Kim. Let's hear from him!
Be cool and say a word.
All of you, who worked hard in this cold weather. All of you, who worked hard in this cold weather.
Thank you.
Somebody said this.
"If you're worried, you will lose, but if you're excited, you will win."
In the future, I wish that the hearts of all of us are filled with all memories of excitement (of this drama).
Here, Cheers!
Cheers!
You've worked hard.
A man's life is usually lonely.
World production of "Morning of Kyeongseong" who are working hard for filming, are you ready, World Production?
Are you ready?
["I'm a man." by Kim Jang Hoon]
♫ You might not know this, but I loved you.♫
♫ I apologize for pretending like a cold-hearted man. ♫
♫ When I let you go for the reason that I'm a man, ♫
♫ I prayed for you to be happy, like a fool. ♫
Creamy skin, Kang Hyun Min!
I love you, Kang Hyun Min!
♫ Only the glass of strong soju is consoling me. ♫
♫ On my lips which used to kiss you with closed eyes, ♫
Creamy skin, Kang Hyun Min!
♫ I'm putting a cigarette instead, lost in memories with you. ♫ ♫ Oh, wind, please rise. ♫
♫ All those words I couldn't tell. ♫
♫ If you meet her, ♫
♫ Will you tell her for me?
♫ I love you, Kang Hyun Min! Creamy skin, Kang Hyun Min!
Kang Hyun Min!
KANG HYUN MIN!
How was it, Kwang Soo!
Chil Goo Hyung!
♫ GOOD BYE~!
♫
Now, wishing for the rating in 50%!
Everyone, you've worked very hard.
Thank you! Well, then, keeping up this great mood, let's move on to the second round at each room.
Please bring your own glass.
Everyone, let's move!
- Bang!
- AARGH! ("007 Bang" : a kind of drinking game)
What is this....
One Shot!
One Shot!
Ah, this damn popularity...
I won't do this again.
0!
7!
- Bang! - AARGH!
One Shot!
One Shot!
Where is he going?
Ah...
I'm about to piss...
Wait.
You're weak, but why are you carrying such heavy stuffs?
Give it to me, I'll do it!
You don't have to help me.
Kwang Soo!
I'll do this.
Kwang Soo, you're going to drive tomorrow, so you'd better get full rest.
No, PD Joo, I slept a lot earlier.
I will do it.
Then, why don't you two do it together?
Bang!
Hey, here, one shot.
One shot!
One shot!
Don't you think this is too much?
It's like saturation bombing!
Then, you just need to not be caught.
One shot!
One shot!
You're good!
Wow, indeed, you're the king of drinking.
Okay, I'm done!
No more!
Hey, how could you just leave?
Ah, this damn popularity!
It's always "to be continued", even during the team dinner.
0!
- 0.
- 7! - Bang!
- Aargh!
I got you!
Would you like one?
Gwangsoo!
He's sure having fun. But...
I can take care of the actors.. but Representative Kim you have to take care of Writer Lee.
Actually, among all, Writer Lee is the one who should take care of her health the most.
If you get sick, it will cause the blank of scripts right away.
Well, we were going to leave the room soon, anyway.
What is this?
What's with this atmosphere, so awkwardly quiet?
Huh?
Should Kang Hyun Min up the mood?
What would be good?
What about Ya Ja Time?
What a stupid game, Ya Ja Time. Anthony, be quiet. (Informally)
Are we starting?
Huh?
Hyun Min, you, stop acting up like that. (informally)
Hey, Min Ah, you think I'll let you off easy because you're the nuna?
Nuna (an older sister) my ass...
How much longer are you going to pretend to be 27?
Be honest.
You're 31.
How old are you?
29.
Stop staring, dude.
Okay okay... let's end it here.
Young Mok, you be quiet. The adults are talking.
Please excuse me.
Yes, you can speak now.
Oh, Representative Kim.
The incident was taken care of?
Yes, thankfully everyone is safe and sound.
Please tell that to the Chief.
Umm, that is..
Is something wrong?
Chief Nam handed in his resignation.
What?
His resignation?
Well, it hasn't been processed yet.
We can talk details when you're back in Seoul.
Oh really, then... Ah, it's been a long time, this is great.
Well, did you finish your business refreshingly (at the restroom), Director?
Now, I'm not a Director any longer. Hey, stop talking formally.
We got hired at the same time.
Geez. Yes, I understood, Director.
You... Come back again.
Hey, I just submitted my resignation.
What are you talking about?
The president hasn't approved it yet.
You know what kind of a person Deputy Director Kim is.
As soon as you you submitted your resignation, he's already so busy to put his people in the important positions.
Do you think that's all? All the dramas with great quality, which you gave the time slots, they are all cancelled now.
Woon Hyeong, I'm begging you. To Drama Department, please come back.
Let's drink.
What are you thinking so hard about?
No, it's nothing.
By the way...
Why did you really run in?
You were the kind of person who worked on the principle of certainty based on numbers.
I'm just curious if you had such confidence when you ran into the fire.
Seriously, why did you run in?
Someone pushed me from behind.
Honestly, I don't know either.
Why I did that in that moment.
I want to know.
The more I know you, the better I want to get to know you.
I am Brad Pitt.
Oh, Bit Na It'll be hard to see you today. I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
That person who got hurt is fine now.
You have to throw a party for him too?
Even so a person I work with came back from the dead.
What am I supposed to do.
So... now you're saying that ajusshi is more important than I am?
That's not what I'm saying.
You're saying you can't come because some nobody extra got hurt.
What?
Some nobody extra?
What?
Am I wrong?
How can you say something like that?
So RUDELY?
What?
Oppa, are you... mad at me right now?
Be honest, right now you're drinking and playing with that bitch Sung Min Ah.
What-
Fine!
I'm playing with Sung Min Ah.
I want to play with Sung Min Ah. All night long!
Oppa!
Do you like that bitch?
YES I LOVE SUNG MIN AH, I LOVE HER VERY MUCH, I LOVE HER SO VERY MUCH!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SUNG MIN AH!
HANGING UP!
Have you gone crazy?
Don't take this wrong.
I might look crazy now, but ...
Don't come any closer!
That's not it-
I said don't come any closer!
No, I mean...
You!
I'm warning you.
Find someone within your league.
- Good Morning!
- Have you slept well?
Representative isn't here?
Ah, he had to go to Seoul.
Ah... riding on that food truck?
Yes.
I wonder if he's doing ok with the trip.
Oh, you're here.
Yes.
Writer Lee, let's go together in my car.
Yes.
It's raining all of a sudden.
This is the first time I've ridden in a car with a writer like this.
Yes.
Ah, you said before, that you and Representative Kim are like an angel and a demon.
Ah, before...
What happened so that he's called as a demon-like bad producer?
I'm just curious if he was different (to you) from Representative Kim whom I know.
Frankly speaking, I like Representative Kim.
No, I mean, two of us used to love each other, so we're trying to work it out from now on.
I'm hoping you, Writer Lee, can help our relationship.
You can tell Represenative Kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him.
All of you, aren't you embarrassed to bring me this rating chart?
CP Choi of the daily drama.
Yes, Deputy Director.
Why do you think your rating is bad?
Why is such bad ratings happening?
And, "Children of Paradise", make it end within this month. It's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better.
It's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better.
Quality, potential... Do you think such things will bring more advertisement?
Until when will you wait for the bit-by-bit increasing rating?
The next drama after "Children of Paradise"...
Where is CP Oh?
Oh, CP Oh!
Don't make some trivial one, but something sensational, something stunning! Yes.
Listen carefully!
I care about only rating.
Rating, rating, rating!
Do properly, please!
Shall we buy a dog, too?
No way. I really hate dogs.
- Why not?
We love dogs a lot.
- Then, who will take care of it?
You must be coming back from grocery shopping.
You should say hello. Hello!
Hello!
Oh this kid.
You look a lot like your dad, huh?
But, Who are you Ahjussi?
Ah, someone dad works with.
Go in, first.
Let's go home.
Goodbye.
I'm sure you've heard the news, and I have nothing to say to you.
Please, just leave.
Were you somebody who feels so little responsibility?
What is your reason? You tried hard to change all shady dirty tricks by even risking your Director position, but now, what on earth is the reason you stepped down from that position? Well, I'm sorry for not taking responsibility for "Morning of Kyeongseong" until the end, but I can't tell you why.
Please leave. Until I hear that reason, I can't leave. The director position I got was given not by my competence, but by that shady trick which I despised so much, and I found that out later.
Well, is that good enough to be a reason? and I found that out later.
Well, is that good enough to be a reason?
What do you mean?
Nam Gook Hyeon, Chairman of Empire Group.
I got the position because of my father's power.
Maybe, that's why I hated you more, Representative Kim.
To me, you seemed worse than my father.
I wanted to deny such father, so I have lived, thinking I don't have a father.
I wanted to hide it until the end if I could.
Well, then that's enough for the reason, isn't it?
No.
If that is why (you resigned), it can't be a reason to me even more.
I also had a family whom I wanted to deny once.
But even so, I didn't run away from the path I had to go.
You once told me that people like me should disappear from this field.
But in the end, I'm still here, but you're leaving.
Before you leave, just keep this in your mind.
Then, at the end, there will be only dirty people left with shady tricks.
Now Hyun Min, pass the thugs sent by Choi, look towards Min Ah.
Hyun Min's face is full of surprise!
That's right, that's right!
Good! Still in shock, Hyun Min's line!
Hyun Min, what about your line?
I'm done with you!
Have your way with the shooting snogging your oh-so-beloved Sung Min Ah!
Huh?
Um, isn't she... Yoon Bit Na of the idol group Angels? Yoon Bit Na of the idol group Angels?
(moron)
Let's take a break for 5 minutes.
Yes.
- Gwang Soo. - Yes, Hyung.
Why didn't you block her? Even if I had blocked her, you'd still have gotten slapped.
So unlucky!
To be honest, I like Representative Kim.
To be more specific, we used to be in love with each other.
And now, we're trying to get back together.
I'm hoping that you, Writer Lee, could help us with that.
Once you get to know him, Representative Kim is quite a catch.
Yes?
Where are you?
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Did you forget?
What?
What do you mean "what"?
You said you were going to re-sign your contract.
That's why you're calling right now?
Is there anything to talk about besides that?
Looks lire you're at your studio, so I'll head that way.
No, don't come.
What?
I said don't come, since I'm going out now.
Where are you going?
Do I have to report that to you too?
Mom!
You're here!
He's been waiting!
Why are you so late?
I heard that you're going to sign a contract for 100 episodes.
He's also promising a lot of money!
Well, I'll leave you two to talk.
I'll run some errands next door.
How did you know to come here?
Besides the writer's room, do you have anywhere else to go but here?
Okay, let's make this contract, Writer Lee.
I'll do it later.
What?
Did that SSD Production Company or whatever contact you again?
Pardon?
How much?
How much did they offer you?
Do you think I'm doing this because of money?
Then what is it?
Don't forget how much I had to suffer in that bitter cold because of you.
No... I - I need to read and review the contract, don't I?
What now?
You can't take your word back, alright?
Alright, I got it!
Lee Go Eun.
Yes?
Don't let me wait too long. Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, Wake up.
Wake up!
What is it?
[Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah are actually in love with each other]
Gwang Soo, how did this happen?
I guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have informed the reporters.
What day?
The day when you got slapped by Miss Yoon Bit Na.
I'm done with you now!
Have it your way with the shooting snogging that oh-so-beloved Sung Min Ah!
Oh my mother, father... Unni, does this even make sense?
Min Ah, you should calm down first. Calm down, calm down.
I think Kang Hyun Min released these articles on purpose.
He did it because I wasn't accepting his heart.
Would he go that far?
Of course!
A moron like him would easily do this!
Unni, you have no idea how much he is into me right now.
Really?
That bad?
What the heck is Representative Oh doing, letting these kind of reports get published?
I know, right?
Really!
Representative, Miss Sung Min Ah is in a scandal in the reports!
What?
With whom?
Well, it's...
Is it Anthony?
What the heck is this? What the heck is this?
The report on Miss Sung Min Ah's scandal.
What the heck?
Since when did they get so close?
No wonder...
I knew it the moment Yoon Bit Na of Angels slapped him.
What?
Slapped him?
What happened?
Come on, spill it!
We have no time to lose! Well, you should take a look at this.
[Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah are actually in love with each other according to a MiK staff]
Representative, were you aware of it, too?
What would you like to have?
Hot Jamaican Blue with extra shot.
Espresso.
Okay.
What the heck are you doing?
What do you mean?
I know very well that you released those reports!
What!
?
Take those reports off while I'm still being civil.
Have you lost your mind?
(informally)
What! ?
What did you say just now?
(informally)
You?
Yes, you!
Listen carefully. I don't know exactly how much you like me but I don't have the slightest interest in you so direct your interest elsewhere and get rid of the articles instantly.
Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah, you both look so great together.
I wish you to continue loving each other in a bashing manner, fighting.
Why are you sitting here?
Oh my Jesus.. Oh my Jesus..
Have you read that scandal news about Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah?
That's very good.
Pardon?
People will now watch the drama with more interests.
It will help the rating, don't you think so?
"Children of Paradise", I think I told you to end it earlier than its original plan. Well, that's...
In case of "Children of Paradise", both the production company and its actors are so determined to work for it until the end.
Moreover, if it ends earlier, the next drama's first airdate should be moved up, but its production company is complaining a lot because they're not ready yet.
Production company, production company, PRODUCTION COMPANY!
What can you do if you keep kissing the asses of production companies!
?
We, who are on top of the heads of such mere production companies, are the "A"! "A"! If we're the "A", then we should show what "A" is supposed to be!
Yes, that's right. Scheduling the dramas is the own right of us, the broadcasting station, but at the same time, it's the promise with viewers.
Should we change that precious promise with viewers just because the rating is bad, or because its commercial value is bad or not, as if we turn our palm over? Well, as far as I know, you submitted your resignation and left our company, so do you think you have the right to come here?
Yes, I just met President.
As of 5 PM, today, I'm approved to come back as Director of Drama Department.
Deputy Director.
Thank you for your work. First, for leaving my position because of my personal reason,
I'm sincerely sorry.
Then, before starting the meeting, let me tell you one thing. That's right, as our Deputy Director Kim said, we're the "A".
But I would appreciate if you remember this point as well.
Justice without power is really helpless and vain.
But power without justice is just violence.
Now, the era of violence must be ended.
The era of violence must not be repeated.
Well, then shall we begin the meeting?
Yes, speaking.
Oh, Representative Kim.
I heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident. I heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident.
Wouldn't there be any problem for our air schedule?
I don't think it's something a jobless person has to concern. Listen well,
I'm talking to you now as Director of Drama Department.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand, Director. Everything will go well without any issue.
Okay, I will rely on you, Representative Kim.
I heard you're reinstated.
Yes.
As you see.
What is the reason you changed your mind?
Well, if you hear that, you will be disappointed.
Well, there is nothing more to be disappointed about.
Yes. This position, that's right, not by my competence but by your power, Father, by unjust method, it's given to me.
Even if I didn't know that, it's also my fault.
But, just quitting isn't solving everything, and I should do my best in this very position to not let this drama field rot, to not let this drama go back to the past dirty way.
I thought that is very important.
Well, times have changed, I guess.
I will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change.
Representative...
What?
Let's think about warm things.
For me, it's baked sweet potatoes.
The first thing coming in your mind is that cheap baked sweet potato?
What's wrong with baked sweet potatoes?
If you're not careful enough, your mouth will get burnt.
You have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot.
Miss, would you like a sweet potato?
No thank you, I'm fine.
Please keep selling many.
No. No, Lee Go Eun.
Don't think useless thoughts.
Concentrate on the script.
Concentrate for the waiting viewers of your drama.
Okay, you can do it! Aja aja! Lee Go Eun, FIGHTING!
Who is it?
It's me.
What are you doing, not opening the door?
What's the matter?
Have you made a decision?
What decision?
Renewing the contract.
Is that why you came?
No.
Because of this. No. Because of this.
You said you wanted to eat roasted sweet potatoes.
You don't remember that night?
You said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes.
I remember.
Don't misunderstand.
I didn't do this because of the contract renewal and I didn't do it for some other ulterior motive either.
Honestly, I just bought them when I saw the street vendor selling them nearby, so just enjoy.
Eat it before it gets cold. I'm leaving.
I don't even believe in myself sometimes but I believe in you.
You're not... crying, right?
No, the two of us, we used to love each other, and now, we're thinking of working it out.
Because of this.
You don't remember that night?
You said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes.
What?
Do they taste bad?
Why do you confuse people?
What?
You're dating Sung Min Ah, why are you being like this to me?
Dating Sung Min Ah?
Who?
What do you mean, "who"?
You are.
Why would that person give me sweet potatoes?
Who said I was dating Sung Min Ah?
Eh?
I don't know where you heard that strange rumor no, I guess you're saying that because you saw me with Sung Min Ah here before.
I don't have such feelings for whomever, so you don't have to be concerned.
Well, it's not that I'm concern about that but...
That is... And, if somebody buys you sweet potato, are you always confused?
What are you confused about?
No...
Well, this... if this is from China or from domestic... I was confused...
That is... Do you by chance like me?
Then again, that would never happen.
Representative.
What?
Episode 15 We have crossed the Rubicon Do you like me by any chance? But then, there is no way you would.
Representative. What? N--No, it's nothing.
So silly. Right! I like you!
I said I like you.
I must be crazy, I'm crazy.
I'm not in my right mind.
I like you!
I said I like you.
Hyung, what are you waiting for?
Just tell her like a man!
Easier said than done.
I just can't work up the courage.
That's why you need to get brave.
Just make up your mind and walk up to her...
Walk up to what?
You have arrived.
PD Joo, what is it?
Something wrong?
No, nothing.
Actually, Joo PD...
Spill it, Goo Hee Jae.
What is it? PD Joo fell in love.
What?
Love?
Yes. The moment he saw the youngest FD of the directing team, he fell for her.
Joo PD.
Yes.
Are you in your right mind?
Eh?
Do you think I pay you just so you could chase chicks at the filming site?
What kind of a production PD doesn't separate his private life from his work?
Tell me.
Are you really dating Kang Hyun Min?
I don't know about it.
If you really want to know, you could go ask that moron yourself.
I need to go for more shooting. Min Ah, either Anthony or Kang Hyun Min, the way I see it, your taste in men is really low.
What?
You know it. Our Hyun Min is so gentle and considerate, which could cause such rumors with Miss Sung Min Ah, but... Hyung, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Representative Choi! Red long johns, red pants!
What'cha doin'?
- Just shut up already!
Ah, at any rate, they're not in a relationship at all.
Yes, then, I'm hanging up.
I was just explaining to the reporter about your rumor!
Ah, you were being interviewed?
Yes. You should have said so then.
Hyung!
How can you hang up so rudely when it was such an important call?
They're only going to get more suspicious!
What exactly do you do for me as my representative?
Do you even know that my Korean beef endorsement contract is about to expire?
Don't worry, they're coming this afternoon.
Really?
I'm warning you.
Stop staring at me.
I'm out of your league, so give up and just concentrate on your drama.
Ah well, with your unrequited love and endorsements... you're busider than a bee, no wonder you'd forget about the drama.
What?
Unrequited love?
Busier than a bee?
Hyung!
Is there a bee farm around here?
Why did it fail?
Hey! Isn't "Morning in Kyeongseong" a total hit?
I know!
Hyun Min Oppa is so amazing in that one!
But, I'm not sure about the recent episodes.
Why?
Think about it. Jin Hye Rin told Kim Woo Jin that she loves him and whatever.
They even kissed!
And now she's going to betray him?
What's up with that?
That's true.
That doesn't make sense.
Roasted sweet potatoes, chips, ramyun...
Such a childish appetite you have.
Don't you care about staying in shape?
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
Your mother is at your studio, so get going.
Mom?
It's delicious.
Aigoo, it already started!
You're watching it again?
Of course! I'm watching all the reruns, too.
Is it that fun?
Of course.
Whose daughter wrote it, after all?
Gosh, why is he like that again?
Go Eun... That Jin Hye Rin, is she betraying Kim Woo Jin after all?
No.
Actually, this will be revealed much later, but she's not really betraying him.
She's pretending to betray him because there's no other way, but she's really helping Kim Woo Jin.
Oh, it was like that?
Had I known that, I wouldn't have been cursing her.
My daughter is amazing!
You are a genius, genius!
It's starting.
Now, let's hear from Mr. Kang Hyun Min's management staff. As you know, our Hyun Min is so gentle and considerate, that it causes such misunderstandings... but at any rate, they're not in a relationship at all.
Why, what are you doing?
Representative Choi! - Just shut up already!
Your voice came out also.
How embarrassing...
Like this, the management is denying the rumor, but reports of witnesses who saw the two actors dating at a cafe or at the filming studio keep surfacing, prompting the possibility of another celebrity couple being in the making, which is a hot potato in the world of entertainment gossip currently.
Ah, seriously!
Celebrity couple in the making?
I told them no! Why don't they believe me?
! That's why you should have been more firm!
My CF, my money is here!
I've been really enjoying "Morning in Kyeongseong" lately. Ah, speaking of which,
How about doing it with Miss Sung Min Ah this time as a couple?
Judging from the drama, the two of you really look great and work well together.
I've been doing this by myself for 3 years, why would I do it with Sung Min Ah now?
Well, it is the wish of the sponsor.
Send the sponsor my message clearly: Either I, Kang Hyun Min, do it by myself,
He will never be able to do it with someone else.
I won't do it!
Oh, you know, right?
That scandal... is total nonsense.
Of course, I know it better than anybody.
Did you want to see me to talk about that?
No. There is someone I'd like you to meet.
Ah, there he comes.
Say hello to the Chief Director of Taesan Group, Kim Sang Jik.
I'm Anthony Kim.
Nice to meet you.
A production company?
Yes.
Our company is going to create the largest production company in Asia.
We would like you to be the CEO of that company.
We'll offer you the highest salary in the industry as well as 10% of the shares.
What do you think? Although, right now, you are the Representative of a small production company, for someone who had once created the legend of Empire, this is a matching offer, I think.
I'm sorry, but I will decline.
Why?
Are you passing up this exceptional offer? Of course, it is an attractive offer, but However, I don't want to work under other people any more.
In thinking about our entertainment group, it's not only into drama but includes management.
This first management contract will be with Sung Min Ah.
If you confirm, then we will move immediately.
It's here.
You said that you wanted to make the world's best production, right?
Why don't you make it, starting from here?
Every year, I will invest $40 million into World Production.
Of course, the owner will be Anthony Kim.
As long as we get 49% of the shares.
What do you think? This offer?
Exactly what is the reason you are offering me this deal? It's because creating a company which exceeds Empire is our goal. Also, the person who created the Empire's myth is you, Anthony, is it not?
I will accept. You have made the right decision!
We will complete the operating details and
I will take it as a confirmed contract.
Then...
You are finally able to achieve your dream. Watching you succeed, while watching you, is also the dream that I hoped for.
♫ Because your two eyes are far away, I only see you.
♫ Because my heart is frozen, I'm hugging you. ♫ When your trembling lips touch my ears, ♫ While I dreamed only of you to say the words I love you.
The person who created Empire's myth is exactly you, Anthony, is it not?
You said that you wanted to make Asia's best production did you not?
Why don't you go ahead and try making it?
Of course, the owner is you, Anthony Kim.
That's right.
The time has come.
Bong Dal Representative, it's me.
I'm in the middle of a meeting. I'm busy, so hang up.
From this moment on, I will start my own drama again.
I think I said that I was in the middle of a meeting.
I'm busy, so hang up.
If you hang up this time, I'm not going to leave you be.
What are taking my word for?
I'm busy right now but because of you....
You said you were a busy person.
You said you were in the middle of a meeting.
Exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck?
Until a few moments ago, I was busy with the meeting.
But what are you trying to say?
By tomorrow morning, please gather the "Morning in Kyeongseong's" crew.
Gather?
It's something more important than anything.
Understand?
So, you're going to fix the uploaded episodes 11 and 12?
Yes, I wanted to show more of the love between the two characters.
Up to now, only in Episode 13, it is realized that Hye Rin came to help Woo Jin.
And then, it was my idea that Hye Rin's character would be seen as nearly sinister.
Because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice.
So you will modify episode 11 by accelerating the content of episode 13?
Yes. With that change, I think it will be possible to see the audience rooting for the two characters.
But, can you amend the screenplay in less than four days?
I can do it.
It's not something to be dealt with by talking. You have a point there to put the story together, but it's a big risk.
If that is to happen, we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before.
Hyun Min, what do you think?
Huh?
Do it like that.
She says she can do it, so why don't we try believing Writer Lee?
Is it not unimagineable, too difficult and are there problems every day?
Can you really do the script in four days?
Yes. I can do it.
Fine. If Writer Lee says she can do it, then I will wait.
Then, take care of yourself.
Let's see how well you can do.
Bye.
The writer says she can do it, so why don't we trust her once?
I mean, that's living.
That fox!
We're in a state of emergency now.
I know. Even if you manage to rewrite the script for 2 episodes, what comes after that is the problem.
For the following episodes, even if there is a problem in the script, we still have to shoot it without changing a thing.
I'm fully aware of it.
You have to keep this in mind, that the decision you just made, put "Morning in Kyeongseong" on a path of no return.
Like Julius Caesar who marched toward Rome in B.C. 49, we have crossed the Rubicon River.
Let them find out at this point... and make a powerful ending...
It's unlocked. Since we're in a state of emergency, we have to save the time for sleep as well as food.
Naturally, until you're done with the revision, you can't leave the studio.
So, what are all these? Multivitamins, Red Ginseng extract, Omega-3 for improving circulation, and this is yogurt, good for constipation.
If you're sitting in one place too long, you get constipated.
Since your physical health is top priority, make sure to take them.
And what is that? Toothpaste, shampoo, and lotion.
Also, since I don't know what you use, I just bought one of each kind.
Why, you don't use the ones with wings?
I bought them because they cost 1500 won more.
You're a man, Representative.
Isn't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman?
I'm not a man, but a producer. You're not a woman, but a writer.
I'll put these away and sit here, so call me if you need anything.
What?
You're not leaving?
Why would I leave?
You're not Writer Kim Soo Hyun.
What, are you sleepy already?
No, nothing.
Yes, I understand.
Then, we will meet next week and discuss.
Make an appointment with the production company, please.
Yes, yes, good work.
By the way, Director...
There's barely enough time for shooting, how can they revise the script now? How about this, hiring a more experienced writer to help Writer Lee Go Eun...
Why don't we trust Writer Lee Go Eun and wait? Seriously, Director, she's a rookie, how can we just trust and wait?
Why, didn't you call her another Writer Kim Soo Hyun?
Well, that..
after continuing 10 more years..
Listen, Director Lee...
Eh?
Just... Just, just...
Uh, Director.
Director...
What do we do Hyun Min?
Why? What's the problem?
I just heard from the Korean beef commercial.
Tthe sponsor says, if you don't do it with Sung Min Ah, he'd choose another couple.
What?
!
Like who? I guess they're trying to contact Jang Dong Gun and Go So Young.
Jang Dong Gun and Go So Young?
(A married couple of superstars)
Miss Sung Min Ah...
I think I warned you, not to stare at me.
Let's talk for a moment.
I don't have anything to talk about with you.
It's only for a moment.
It's a very important thing.
So, let me get this straight.
you want us to be in a Korean beef commercial as a couple?
I'm not interested. Look for someone else.
Don't take this wrong.
I don't want to be in a commercial with you, Miss Sung Min Ah.
Then why are you asking to do it together?
Well, you could call it the responsibility of the leading actor...
Besides, why are you so selfish, Miss Sung Min Ah?
What?
When Writer Lee is working so hard, are you just going to sit there and do nothing?
When we do a commercial as a couple, it will also promote more awareness of our drama... Stop that nonsense, and tell me the real reason.
Ah man, really...
Money.
Can't you just do it this once?
I'll do anything you ask.
Fine, but I have one condition.
Do a TV interview in person, Mr. Kang Hyun Min, that we're not in a relationship.
Also, release news reports to clarify the rumors.
Just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us.
Can you promise to do that?
Deal.
Then, me too.
Deal!
Do you think this makes sense?
Why doesn't it?
Kim Woo Jin gives up his lifelong dream and goes to rescue Jin Hye Rin?
What a nonsense!
He loves her that much! Of course he'd rush to save Jin Hye Rin, leaving everything behind.
What idiot gives up his dream for love?
How can you make Kim Woo Jin into a fool just to save the character of Jin Hye Rin? How can you make Kim Woo Jin into a fool just to save the character of Jin Hye Rin? How can you make Kim Woo Jin into a fool just to save the character of Jin Hye Rin?
If he loves her to death, why wouldn't he? In case you haven't noticed, humans are innately selfish.
In case you haven't noticed, humans are innately selfish.
They cry when they're hungry, and they smile when they're full.
Have you ever been in love at all? Have you ever been in love at all? Have you ever been in love at all?
How can you not understand this?
Unlike your elementary unrequited crushes, I have had lots of experience.
How many? Like what?
Kissing and sleeping together.
You mean, doing those is love?
What else is there to it?
Uh, so low!
Yes, I'm a third-rate lowlife.
But you don't even have that experience.
Ah, whatever.
I got it. Let's stop this conversation now.
I'll just write the script. I'll just write the script.
Sure, you write the script.
I'll make a trip to the office.
You still seem to think that you're right.
But admit it, you're wrong.
Just go already!
Your son looks really amazing.
Producing a great drama like that.
You must be really proud of him.
He should find a good woman before I pass on.
He's not married yet?
I even wonder if he ever liked someone?
Because of the hardships he had to endure, he only knows to pretend to be strong.
He doesn't know how to open up his heart to someone.
I see.
If he had been born to good parents, he could have had a happy life... What are you doing, not writing the script?
It's a movie I must watch for the script.
Love Letter?
Yes, I've watched it about 100 times now.
Why would you watch it again then?
Well, to get into the emotional mood, I have to watch it even for 101st time!
It's all because you've never been in love that you're watching something like this.
Stop nagging like that.
I'm going to watch it anyway.
Are you doing well?
I'm doing fine!
You're supposed to make others cry, not cry yourself.
Are you doing well?
(In Japanese) Are you doing well?
Is that sad?
Please stop crying so ugly.
You're disturbing the person next to you.
It's sad but really beautiful, right?
No?
Eh?
About what? After a long time has passed, she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book.
Even the title of the book is "In search of lost time."
I read that book so many times even...
I mean it. You were never in true love, Representative.
Have you ever even shed tears for love? Because my eyes are blinded, all I can see is you Because my heart is frozen, I wrap my arms around you When your trembling lips get closer to my ears, my heart, that had been dreaming of only you...
Because my eyes are blinded, all I see is you, because my heart is frozen,
I wrap my arms around you.
When your trembling lips get closer to my ears, Anthony, are you crazy?
This is nonsense.
How can that tomboy look so pretty in my eyes?
Are the terms of the contract ok?
- Both Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah agree... so I don't think it'll be a problem.
Don't we need to hear what Writer Lee Go Eun thinks?
Shall we call her?
Well then, Representative...
Um, Representative?
Huh?
Oh, what did you say?
Ah, so cold.
It's too cold!
It wakes me right up!
Seriously.
It's cold!
Yes, Chief Director.
I'm calling because the chairman would like to meet you in person and discuss the contract.
How about Friday evening?
That's fine. I'll see you then.
Alright, we'll decide on the time and place and contact you again.
Yes, good bye.
The door is open, what are... Wait, why am I doing this?
Stop this, Anthony. I'm a producer, and she's a writer.
I guess the others haven't come in yet?
Why?
Here's the revised draft of the script.
What do you think?
It's good.
Well done.
Cut!
Ok!
The revised draft makes it so much easier to empathize!
The starting point isn't too bad. PD Joo, what are you doing? !
What is the viewership rating for today?
19.8%.
It went up 2.1% from the day before!
Yeah!
Ah, good job everyone.
"Morning in Kyeongseong" soars even higher as the truth behind Jin Hye Rin's betrayal is revealed
"Morning in Kyeongseong" leads the viewership rating for 6 weeks in a row, going over 20%
As the romance of Kang Hyun Min and Sung Min Ah develop, "Morning in Kyeongseong" keeps its lead.
Lately, the viewership rating has been soaring up impressively.
Well, I don't concern myself too much over the viewership ratings.
The only thing that I'm interested in is the love from you.
Actually, there is a rumor that all your attention is focused on a specific person, causing the numerous fans of Mr. Kang Hyun Min to watch "Morning in Kyeongseong" in jealousy.
Today, we'd like to hear the truth.
The rumor with Miss Sung Min Ah, is it really just a rumor?
Today, until you give us an answer about the rumor, I won't let you go.
Ah, just answer him, you moron!
Miss Sung Min Ah, right.
She's a great actress.
She's a good actor and a good person. I can swear over my family, sadly, it is only a rumor.
We're not dating.
You're not dating.
However, you may count on the Kim Woo Jin that is acting with Miss Sung Min Ah. The promise made with my pride as an actor at stake,
I must keep for sure.
Ensure the health of the hubby with Korean beef?
Newlywed couple style?
More like an arranged marriage.
Are you kidding me?
Hello.
Today's shooting is about a newlywed couple.
Ah, I see.
Did you get a botox shot?
What?
Well, you look somewhat different.
Chu~?
It's delicious.
Take care of your husband's physical health with Korean beef.
Korean beef!
I just visited Hoengseong recently.
[Hoengseong: famous town for Korean beef]
I count on you to promote more awareness about Korean beef.
What's with that face?
You got money and Korean beef!
Isn't this awesome?
Ah, what a pathetic bum.
Pathetic bum?
Do you think I'm just doing this for the money? Even Anthony and Writer Lee, for the drama, are working on the script together.
Then we, also for the drama, could shoot commercials and promote our drama!
They're working on the script together?
Didn't you know? All day long, they're stuck together like this, working on the script, I think.
I told you not to skip the supplements.
You caught a cold because you're not physically fit.
Thirty minutes after a meal.
I'll make sure to take them this time.
Don't smile.
You grow on me.
My studio isn't that far.
I can just walk...
It's because I'm cold.
Hello?
It's me, Min Ah.
(Wait over there for a moment)
Yes.
Are you busy?
Well, busy as usual.
Then, can you get out for a moment?
I have something to tell you, and I'm free this evening.
Alright.
Alright.
I'll see you then.
We're going to relocate our office.
The office?
Yes, to a much bigger place.
Is it something Miss Sung Min Ah helped you with?
She introduced me to a company that wants to invest in our shares.
Yes. Once the contract goes smoothly tomorrow, I'll get you a new studio with a better view, so you can prepare for the next project.
With Sung Min Ah as the lead.
With Miss Sung Min Ah as the lead actress?
That was their condition.
So stop beating around the bush and putting off your contract renewal, and let's renew your contract.
Yes.
It couldn't have been easy for a rookie writer to change the course of the storyline in the middle.
You must have really helped her a lot, Representative.
Of course. She couldn't have come this far without my help.
Speaking of which, I'd like to let Lee Go Eun write our next project, too.
What do you think?
Well, if the script is good, I have nothing against it.
Sure.
Ah, you know what's tomorrow, right?
The contract with the chairman of Taesan Group.
Yes, at 6pm in Cheongdamdong, I heard.
Since you'll meet him for the first time, it would be good to talk over dinner.
So I asked them to meet there.
You used to like the restaurants there. Also, tomorrow, I'll also expect to hear your answer to my question.
Don't tell me you forgot?
Can you tell me that you don't have any feelings for me?
Then, stop telling me to forget.
Once we start again, there won't be any reason for us to break up ever again.
Min Ah, I'll wait.
Also, tomorrow, I'll expect to hear your answer to my question.
Don't tell me, you forgot.
Your vision got blurry all of a sudden, and you felt dizzy?
Yes.
Did you have a lot of stress lately, or did you overwork yourself?
What man in Korea doesn't live like that?
Then, are you taking any drugs for long term?
I've been taking an antidepressant for about 3 years now.
Three years... Then, have you had these symptoms before that? No, it never happened before, only recently, about twice.
We'll know more after you get a thorough physical exam and get the results back.
At this point, it seems like a side effect of the antidepressant.
Cut!
Okay!
We'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes!
Gwang Soo, phone.
Gwang Soo? So, over that pretty faced FD chick, the two of you are having a mental race?
Yes. Gwang Soo, in order to capture the heart of a lady; first, you have to show her your own sexy smile often.
Smile.
Smile.
Director? Look at Sung Min Ah, she's so stunned.
But if I keep sending her the same smile over and over, someday she'll ask.
Ask what?
Why do you smile like that whenever you see me?
And then?
Then, you need to say an impactful, short, and concise phrase that will seduce her.
Your eyes make me smile.
Eww, it's so cheesy!
I feel nauseous.
Did you take your pills?
You're here?
I said did you take your medicine?
Yes.
How's your fever?
I think it went down.
Stop writing the script for today and rest.
No I'm fine.
I have to hurry and write and turn in the script for episode 13, so I can't rest.
Don't argue and just go to the hospital.
Go and get another shot.
Yeah.
It's me, Min Ah.
Did you leave yet?
Soon.
I'm also leaving in a few, so don't be late.
The CEO is sensitive to timeliness.
Don't worry.
Or, shall we meet up and go together?
Lee Go Eun.
Lee Go Eun!
Lee Go Eun!
Stay conscious!
Hello? Representative!
Lee Go Eun!
Get up.
What?
What's is it?
No, it's nothing...
I think we have to leave now.
Oh...ok... I got it... Lee Go Eun, stay focused.
You're here, President?
Oh, it's been a long time.
There must be a lot of traffic.
Yes. A little.
Why don't we order first, President?
Yes, let's do so.
Hold on, Lee Go Eun.
We're almost at the hospital, so hang in there!
Where is she hurting?
She had an oncoming cold this afternoon, and right now she has a really bad fever.
She overworked for a few days...
How is it?
Her temperature is 40.8.
She must've been in a lot of pain...
Prepare her some fever reducer. Yes.
I think we need to wait until her fever cools down.
Are you conscious now?
What happened?
What do you mean what happened?
Your fever went over 40 and you fainted.
If it hurts you should've said so.
What are you doing here?
What about the contract?
Hurry up and go.
Did you forget who was here today?
How could you throw away such an important contract?
I'm sorry
There was a situation.
What situation?
What problem is greater than your dream, your future?
Was Writer Lee Go Eun such an important person to you?
Why can't you answer?
Is Writer Lee Go Eun so important to you?
That's right.
Lee Go Eun is an important person to me.
I finally realized it.
That Lee Go Eun... is such an important person to me.
[Preview] About when Kim Woo Jin goes to save Jin Hye Rin...
I think you're right.
You have a guy, don't you?
Is it Kim Bong Dal?
If you bother Writer Lee one more time, I swear to God.
Kang Hyun Min is all over the place.
I only saw his foot acting.
Am I that bad at acting?
Do you honestly think my acting is that bad?
Have you ever put effort into acting?
What are you doing tonight?
We have to sign a contract.
Why are we writing a contract on Christmas Eve?
...but why does my vision get cloudy at times?
How would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound?
Episode 16 In search of lost time I'm sorry. Something came up.
What came up? What can possibly be more important than your dream and your future? Is Writer Lee Go Eun that important to you?
Why aren't you answering? I asked if Writer Lee Go Eun is that important to you. That's right.
Lee Go Eun is a very important person to me.
I didn't realize it until just now.
Lee Go Eun.
How dear she is to me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, the person that was here, where did she go?
Ah, she was discharged earlier.
Lee Go Eun! Lee Go Eun, snap out of it!
Lee Go Eun!
Are you alright?
If you were sick, you should have told me so!
Are you feeling better now?
What happened with the contract?
It went well.
It's a relief.
Yes, it's a relief.
Get some rest.
By the way, about Kim Woo Jin rescuing Jin Hye Rin. Pardon?
I think you're right.
Yes, this is Anthony.
I was just wondering about calling you, too... Don't worry. I heard that the Writer was critically ill.
Is she doing alright?
Yes, she is, but how did you...?
I heard from Miss Sung Min Ah.
The chairman is also impressed by your devoted care of your writer, and does not want to miss the opportunity of working with you.
We'll make another appointment soon for the contract.
Thank you! Bye!
Bye!
[A K]
The person you called is not available.
Connecting to the voicemail...
I didn't realize it until just now.
Lee Go Eun.
How dear she is to me.
Good news!
Another commercial offer.
This time, it's for a painkiller.
Miss Sung Min Ah is in agony because of a bad headache, and tada~ I appear to hand you the pills.
Listen carefully...
From now on until I die, I won't ever do another commercial with you, Mr. Kang Hyun Min.
Got it?
What's up with her?
Does she not like it because it's painkillers?
I like it.
"Meltaway Q!"
Thank you.
Thanks to you, the contract will be fine.
Good for you.
Also... Your feelings for Writer Lee Go Eun, I understand. Working together for some time can bring the two of you closer, and you can grow on each other.
However, even after the drama is over, will your feelings stay the same?
I won't be impatient.
When the time comes, I'll be able to hear the answer.
Are you sure you were sick?
Yes. I was really, really sick.
Did you see a doctor?
Of course I did!
Aigoo, if you were that sick, you should have called me.
How could you go see a doctor by yourself?
No, I didn't go alone.
With whom?
Well, with... a person?
A person?
Who exactly?
Ah, Mom, I'm eating!
You... have a man, right?
No!
Lee Go Eun got a man!
Who is it?
Who?
Is it that Kim Bong Dal guy?
Oh, no!
My tummy might get upset!
Aren't you Writer Lee's mother?
Omo, if it isn't the Representative!
Where are you going?
I fixed some food for Go Eun, and now I'm on my way home.
I'll give you a ride then.
Get in.
No, well, you don't have to.
The day is too cold for you to walk.
Please get in.
Have you been doing well lately?
What is there to do well?
Just being busy with my livelihood, not even noticing my own daughter getting sick.
But, by any chance, Representative, do you know Kim Bong Dal?
Kim Bong Dal?
Yes.
But why are you curious about that person? Well, it seems like my Go Eun is interested in him, but she wouldn't tell me anything.
But, Representative, is it a person you know? Well, yes, I never got to meet him in person, but I heard that he has a good reputation and his future seems bright.
According to what I've heard, he even has good looks.
Then, take care.
When you're not too busy, come in for a meal.
Yes.
Thanks for the ride.
Then, you should get back.
No, I'll see you get in first and then take off.
Ah, don't worry about me and just get back.
Then, I'll see you again later.
Aigoo, did he take something wrong?
Where did his manners come from?
That's so not like him at all!
I think the Grand Prize for Best Actor should go to Shin Ha Gyoon. His acting was good, and, more importantly, the viewership ratings were excellent.
In terms of viewership ratings, Kang Hyun Min is a good contender, too.
Though his acting is nothing out of the ordinary, but he's scheduled for another SBC drama next year.
The Grand Prize for Best Actor should go to a good actor.
Yes, I understand both of your positions, but how about Jang Joo Sung?
What, Jang Joo Sung?
Yes. Yes, well, the viewership ratings were low, but just looking at acting alone, he was the best this year.
Listen, M broadcasting is giving it to Cha Seung Won, and K broadcasting is giving it to Park Shin Yang.
Yet, we're going to give it to an obscure, aged actor?
It's the Grand Prize after all, it should go to a star with some clout. It's not an award of appreciation.
It's not an award of appreciation.
Yes, isn't that even more reason for Mr. Jang to receive it? Yes, isn't that even more reason for Mr. Jang to receive it?
It literally is the Grand Prize for Best Actor.
Regardless of starship or viewership rating, but solely looking at the acting performance, right? Well, Director, let's take things with a grain of salt.
The awarding ceremony for the Grand Prize is another TV show.
It is another competition for viewership ratings.
Besides, we have to discuss this matter with the Variety Department as they're preparing the ceremony.
So, Director Nam, you should pay attention to our opinions, too, this time.
Yes, I understand.
Then, we shall continue this discussion in our next meeting.
I'll come back again.
Take care of yourself.
Cut!
Ok!
Now, let's eat before going to the next scene!
Then, we'll resume shooting in an hour.
Have a good meal!
Does a top star have to eat at such an open place?
There are no good restaurants around here.
Have you watched "Morning in Kyeongseong" this week?
Of course.
Kang Hyun Min was practically flying in his action scenes.
All I could see of Kang Hyun Min was his sucky acting.
That's true.
My eyes are all for Min Ah Noona.
How could you even notice Kang Hyun Min? Hey, isn't that Kang Hyun Min over there?
Over there.
He is!
He's good looking.
He does look superb. For real!
Don't miss your classes.
Only Kang Hyun Min. Um, Hyung, is Sung Min Ah even prettier than on screen?
Yes.
Make-up does wonders.
What?
It's Sung Min Ah.
Whoa!
Sung Min Ah!
Hyung, do it quick, hurry!
Sung Min Ah is leaving!
I'd like to get an autograph, too.
Ah, yes.
By the way, what is your name, young man?
Brad Pitt.
Alright, one person at a time.
What is your name?
- Park Sung Hoon!
Gwang Soo?
From now on, we should always eat in front of an all-girls highschool.
I was thinking of preparing Red Ginseng as presents for the broadcasting companies for this season.
What?
Red Ginseng?
Red Ginseng my bum.
That doesn't suit the scale of the Empire.
Prepare imported wine. Top notch grade.
Yes. Understood.
What?
Red Ginseng?
Present Red Ginseng to the broadcasting companies with seasonal greetings?
Yes, I think that would be appropriate.
Are you in your right mind?
We don't have money for that!
You may leave.
Yes. Ah, PD Joo,
Yes.
Bring me the CVs of the writers with whom we have contracts.
Our... writers?
The only writer that has a contract with us is just Writer Lee.
Yes, bring hers.
Why do you want her CV all of a sudden?
Do I have to explain that to you?
No.
Sorry, I was too busy.
I sincerely apologize.
But I don't think I can come to the Christmas reunion this year, either, because I have to work on my script.
I guess you guys will have fun without me. Yes, but instead,
I'll treat you generously next year after the drama is done.
Alright.
See you next year.
Yes.
Her hobby is to watch movies, specialty is Tae... Official 4th degree Black Belt in Taekwondo... Favorite food is grilled mackerels and... roasted sweet potatoes.
Favorite movie is Love Letter. Love Letter... Yes, I've watched it about 100 times now.
It's really sad, but really beautiful at the same time.
Don't you agree?
Are you fine?
(In Japanese)
I'm fine.
Man, that scared me.
What a shock.
Don't you know how to knock?
I did knock, but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered.
At any rate, why have you come here?
To get some printer paper.
What were you watching, anyway?
None of your concern.
Ah, I think I know.
You know what?
Well, what men normally watch.
Steamy stuff.
That's not it.
I know men watch it quite often.
It's ok.
I said that's really not it.
Oh, that's Love Letter!
Yes, it's Love Letter!
I thought you didn't like this movie?
Just to review my Japanese.
That's all.
But your Japanese is excellent. Superb.
To learn the dialect of Kobe. Their accent.
My eyes were too busy watching Min Ah Noona.
How could you even notice Kang Hyun Min?
Hyung?
When is the SBC Drama Awards ceremony?
The 31st. Why?
Let's see... possible contenders for the Grand Prize of Best Actor are... me... me...
There's only me!
No way. There's Shin Ha Gyoon.
Ah, that's right.
Ha Gyoon Hyung.
Ah, the Brain...
Shin Ha Gyoon of the Brain is too strong...
Can't let that happen.
At this point, I need an impactful scene that will set this Kang Hyun Min apart for sure! Hyung, you just said that the new script is out, right? Hyung, when Jin Hye Rin is bawling her eyes out at the end here, what if I did that?
You?
The viewers will be totally awed!
Hyung, tell Gwang Soo to get the car ready.
Well, Gwang Soo has been rather busy lately.
What?
Busy?
The personal assistant is busier than the actor?
Well, that's not what I mean...
Let's just go the two of us today.
I understand.
However, take the wage for today out of Gwang Soo's payment for the month.
Take it out!
The closer you are, the more clearcut you have to be with money.
Isn't that right, Bumblebee?
You're going to the military service soon?
Yes, I just got my draft notice.
Please take good care of our Hyun Min Hyung. Unlike what appears on TV, there are many surprising things about Hyung.
Yes, I heard from Representative Choi that he requires a lot of extra care.
Actually, Hyun Min Hyung does not like to read the script.
So, when he's playing videogames, you have to read it out loud to him.
Also, when Hyung chooses a drama, he prefers melodrama.
It's because melodramas bring more commerical endorsement offers for the male lead.
That's what he believes.
The more I think about it, the more it doesn't make sense.
How can a drama not have the aspect of melodrama?
Gwang Soo.
When there is an appointment, he makes sure to be later than the other actor. His sense of pride is strong, so he thinks that to wait for someone is to lose.
What?
Sung Min Ah is very punctual with her schedule?
I told you to go slow, Gwang Soo. Lastly, he may say preposterous things sometimes, but you should just agree with him.
He may not be that bright, but he's a good Hyung.
Ah, hey...
Jin Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin.
I need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum...
Who is it?
Writer Lee!
Writer Lee!
Open the door!
Open!
Merry Christmas, a present for you.
What is it this time?
Just take it, it's really just a Christmas present, nothing more.
Omo! The size is perfect, and they're really pretty!
Thank you!
Now that you received my gift, shall we cut to the chase?
That's not possible!
Why not?
This drama is for Kang Hyun Min, and this Kang Hyun Min wants to bawl his eyes out.
Kim Woo Jin is shot, and Jin Hye Rin embraces him and cries.
Yes, but instead of Jin Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin can cry!
Tears of a man.
How innovating is that?
Well, I suppose it could be innovating, but Sung Min Ah is better...
She is better what?
Ah, well, what I mean is..
Kim Woo Jin gets shot in Jin Hye Rin's place and is bleeding...
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know about that.
Just keep in mind that this is the third time.
Third time for me to ask you to change something.
I ended up swimming in the ocean and kissing that Sung Min Ah. Humanly speaking, if I scratch your back, you should scratch my back, too. Give and Take.
I warn you. If you don't change it this time, I won't go easy on you.
I sent off the new script to the printing office.
I'll be stopping at Writer Lee's studio to drop something off before going home.
Yes, I see.
Wait.
Yes?
I'll just take it to her. I need to talk with her anyway.
You, Representative?
What's with that look on your face?
Why, is it something heavy?
Hyung.
I heard about everything.
You're going to serve in the military?
Yes. I got the draft notice unexpectedly.
I'm sorry.
I've come to say my last good bye.
Stay in good health, Hyung.
Gwang Soo.
I bought it myself from the grocery store.
Hyung! Hyung, thank you for everything, in 2 years from now, I'll be back in better shape.
Yes, I'll be waiting.
Take care.
Gwang Soo!
Take good care of yourself!
I mean, does that even make sense?
He wants to do the crying scene of Jin Hye Rin?
At any rate, what should I do?
He won't get over it easily this time.
Who is it?
It's me.
Why are you here?
This.
PD Joo told me to bring it to you.
Ah. So you came all the way here just to bring this to me?
Well... thats right...
Is the script going well?
Yes.
Ah, what should I do?
What?
Mr. Kang Hyun Min came by earlier, and...
What did Hyun Min want?
But, why are you here, Representative?
Did you see Writer Lee Go Eun earlier today?
Did Writer Lee say that?
She's such a snitch.
Well, about that sobbing scene, don't you think it would be better if Kim Woo Jin did the crying?
Hmm...
Kim Woo Jin crying?
You sure are professional, understanding my gist right away. Well, at the awards ceremony at the end of the year,
Ha Gyoon Hyung and I are strong candidates for the Grand Prize for Best Actor.
If I were to show an impactful scene at this point, I might be able to secure the award!
How's that? Okay, so you want the script to be revised so that you'd do the crying instead?
Exactly that!
Do you think you can do that?
Huh?
You only got this far by pure dumb luck.
With your pathetic acting skills, do you really think you can do that?
Are you done joking with me?
Nope, I've still got a lot more to say.
Do you know yourself? Your script analysis is emelentary level, you don't even know how poor your acting is, you're the world's biggest idiot there ever was! As such, when the script comes out, don't even change one thing about it, and just read it properly!
Got it? But... I said, do you understand!
What's up with him?
Why is he like that to me?
Yes, I just saw Hyun Min.
You saw him?
What did he say?
Didn't he throw a fit?
Nope.
I talked to him with reason, and he accepted it with no problem.
Really?
Yes. He'll do according to the script.
Is that true?
He even said he's sorry for bothering you. Is that true? He even said he's sorry for bothering you.
That's a relief.
I mean, you're really amazing, Representative.
You took care of it so easily. I was getting a headache over it.
Who am I?
Who else?
Mr. Kim Bong Dal.
Anthony.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
If anything ever troubles you, just let me know any time.
You have come.
Shall we?
The chairman expects a lot from you, Mr. Anthony.
The preparation for relocating your office will be finished within this month.
Ah, Miss Sung Min Ah is already here.
Oh, I finally get to see you.
I'm Anthony Kim.
Aigoo, I've heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.
Please have a seat.
I think I'll need to take business lessons from you, Mr. Anthony.
Don't say something like that even as a joke.
I don't deserve such praise.
Dramas are made by people, after all.
And you, Mr. Anthony, know the importance of people.
Which makes me very glad to be working with you. Well, then,
I look forward to the business you'll lead, Mr. Anthony.
Best wishes.
I don't know how to express my gratitude to you.
Then, instead of saying it to me, show me.
Just like you had made the actress Sung Min Ah into a top star, make your World Production into the best company in the world.
I look forward to it.
A new personal assistant?
Yes, my name is An Sung Mo. You may have heard from Gwang Soo already, I totally abhor posers, hypocrites, and such.
Call me Hyung from now on.
Yes. Yes, Hyung.
At any rate, how did it go with Writer Lee?
Is she going to revise the script?
Hyung, don't get me started on it.
Last night, that bastard Anthony came all the way here, and...
He came here?
What?
My script analysis is elementary level and he called me the worst performing actor ever!
Does that make sense?
I'm a bad actor?
Who does he have to thank for leading the viewership ratings?
Seriously!
Sung Mo?
Yes.
What do you think?
About what?
What else?
My acting.
Yes, you used to be one of the normal viewers, so you would be an accurate judge.
Tell me.
Is the acting performance of this Kang Hyun Min pathetic?
Just be honest.
Just be honest.
Is it really true?
Yes.
What do you mean, yes?
Well, I mean, you have good looks, but but your acting isn't... that great.
Hey, Sung Mo, you must be referring to Hyun Min's debut performance!
Uh... I've watched them all... even the most recent ones.
Well, you told me to be honest.
Gwang Soo...
[Gwang Soo]
Uh, Hyung, what I said earlier didn't upset you, did it?
Why would it upset me?
Who do you think I am?
Sung Mo, I'm not that petty. Well, that's a relief. You know,
I'm really bad at lying.
I can see that.
Just focus on driving. So that we won't be late.
Yes, Hyung.
[Kang Hyun Min's impactful performance crosses the sea with his eyes]
Honestly, Kang Hyun Min's acting is overrated.
His good looks covers it all. However, those looks are fading, too.
I'm only watching it for Sung Min Ah. When I see KHM, I can't concentrate on the show.
He sucks.
Hey, what day is better than Christmas Day to confess your felings to her?
You have to make a dash for it!
He's right.
Well, that's why I bought something for her,
What?
What is it?
Let's see!
Show us!
Excuse me.
Matching rings!
Am I going too forward with this?
Does the woman express the feelings first?
It is the man who has to open up first! Hear, hear!
Besides, a matching set of rings sends a direct message of "let's date."
It's straightforward!
- True, true.
I read a report that the gift that women want the most for Christmas is jewelry!
I got this after reading that.
What's so merry here?
Well, PD Joo got a gift for the pretty FD.
I'm sorry, Representative.
Not separating my personal life from work...
Well, that's life after all.
So what is it that you're hiding?
Huh?
Let me see what you got her.
Tada!
They're couple rings.
Supposedly, this is what women want the most for Christmas.
Good luck.
Where do you buy stuff like that?
Would you like me to take them out for you to see?
The second one from the right.
This one?
Is it a gift?
No.
My nephew has been begging me for it.
Pardon?
Well, I guess my nephew got a girlfriend, but he's so shy.
Ah, I see.
What is the nephew's size?
Well, maybe... about this? Ah, I guess his size is the same as the uncle?
We're family, after all.
Ah.
Then, what about the size of the girl your nephew likes?
Well,
I think about this big.
You're going to gift it, you should call and ask first.
If the size doesn't fit after opening the gift, she may think you're not considerate.
Bong Dal Kim.
Mr. Bong Dal.
Yes, Representative.
Do you have plans this evening?
Why?
Why else?
We've got to write our contract.
Why are we writing the contract on Christmas Eve?
In the evening even?
Because I say so.
At 8pm, come to the restaurant that... No, I'll decide on the location.
You?
A nice place that I really like.
Must be a shabby place that suits you perfectly.
You'll have to see for yourself. I'll text you. See you later then.
Finish the script before you come out.
I'm done already.
That's good.
See you later.
Yes?
This is the Moonhwa University Hospital.
Your test results from Thursday are out.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
I'm on my way.
Now, don't get too excited because it's Christmas Eve.
Let's finish this quick so we can get home early.
Yes, understood!
For the next scene, use the 300mm lense and zoom in on Hyun Min's face.
I'm sorry. I only prepared the 200mm lense.
Then, use the 200mm lense, we'll crop later, and magnify it to look like 300mm.
Yes.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
Where is the FD?
She's probably in Mr. Kang Hyun Min's room.
Ah, I see.
Well, then... do you have time this evening?
Well, if the shooting gets done early enough, sure. Then, we'll resume shooting in 5 minutes, so tell Mr. Kang Hyun Min to get ready, please.
Yes, I understand.
Woo Jin!
Woo Jin!
Are you okay?
How can this be?
!
This is all my fault!
Woo Jin!
Woo Jin!
Are you alright?
Don't worry.
The people...
I am sorry.
Cut!
Let's go again.
Ready?
Action!
Don't worry.
Soon, people...
I am sorry.
Don't worry. Soon, people...
I am sorry.
Don't worry. Soon, people...
I am sorry.
Don't worry. Soon, people...
I really am sorry.
Cut!
Let's take a break for 10 minutes.
What exactly is the problem?
Is it because I refused the commercial endorsement deal?
That's not it.
If not, then why are you making me cry for hours like this?
!
I'm really sorry.
I'm just feeling under the weather today.
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.
How much have I cried?
My eyes are gonna be all puffed up.
Unni, can you get me an ice pack?
Yes.
Do you have some time?
I have something to say.
Start talking. What is it?
You're not hung up about the commercial...
Is my acting really that bad?
From your perspective, is my acting really poor? From your perspective, is my acting really poor?
What do you want me to say?
Please tell me honestly. As an actress. For you to ask me in person, doesn't that mean you already think so?
Then, let me ask you one thing.
Have you ever put any effort into acting?
Or do you know about your weaknesses?
Then, what about you?
Do you have a weakness you know about?
Who doesn't have weaknesses?
I'm still practicing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to improve my pronunciation since my debut.
Ga Gya Geo Gyeo, like a child learning the alphabet, with a pen between my teeth.
If you really felt a problem with your acting, you yourself have to know what it is to fix it.
No matter what other people tell you, you have to know it for yourself.
Spend some time to think about it.
It doesn't seem like a side effect of the antidepressant.
There doesn't seem to be a problem with your other tests.
Then why does my vision get blurry sometimes?
Hmm... How about getting yourself tested at the opthalmology?
I'll arrange it.
Since you're here already, why don't you get tested.
Tada~ it looks nice.
What exactly is the problem?
Do you have a family member with poor eyesight?
Yes.
That is correct.
Is that your mother?
Yes, but how? Yes, you have Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy that is maternally inherited.
It progresses really fast with few preliminary symptoms, so your right eye is already in bad shape.
Looking at the pace of the condition, your right eye will lose its sight completely soon.
Once that happens, unfortunately, even your left eye will... eventually, you'll lose sight in both your eyes.
Wow, I hadn't seen you in a while.
Have you been well?
Yes, have you been well?
Yes.
Would you like to order?
Well, I'm waiting for someone today. When he gets here, I will.
Did you get a boyfriend by any chance?
No.
I'm here.
Where are you?
I'm here...
Where are you?
In search of lost time
Please leave a trace after reading the book.
(All entries are by Lee Go Eun)
Since your mother has this condition, you must know it very well.
There is no real way to cure it.
I regret to say this, but you should make preparations before both eyes lose sight.
Ah, what are you doing?
!
Can't you pour the water properly?
My eyes sting!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not eating!
Why?
Does it taste bad?
You eat it, Mom.
You can't even tell sugar and salt apart!
Dummy.
Idiot!
Excuse me.
I guess the traffic is bad.
Um... I'm sorry, but we're closing.
Ah, yes...
Where did you go to be back so late?
You ignored my text and my calls.
What is this?
I'm sorry.
Well, was something the matter?
Yes.
My mother was not well.
Omo. Is she doing okay?
Well, if that's what happened, why didn't you tell me?
Well, I guess you didn't really have the mind to do that.
Get in.
Since you so desperately wish to renew my contract, I'll do it.
Let's do that later.
It's late. Get back and rest.
Lee Go Eun...
When did it start?
Your feelings for me.
I deceived you.
I betrayed you.
I was so mean to you. Despite all that, when did you start liking me?
Episode 17 Do not be afraid of the darkness I deceived you. I betrayed you.
I was so mean to you. Despite that, when did you start liking me? Did something happen?
Nothing happened. Get inside and rest. Representative!
Why was he like that?
What happened that he even had tears in his eyes?
Regrettably, it looks like the initial diagnosis still stands.
Since your mother has this condition, you must know this already, but there is no way to cure it at this point.
*Currently, no cure is available.
How to learn Braille
You need to start getting ready for it.
Normally, people with acquired blindness take about 3-5 years to adjust to be able to perform daily functions.
Even just getting out of the house can feel like a formidable challenge.
From just grabbing a spoon to going to the bathroom, you have to learn how to do them by yourself.
Do you have family that could take care of you?
What is the percentage?
The chance of me going blind.
I'll ask one more question.
Why is it me?
My mom wasn't enough?
Why are you even doing this to me? I have finally found the reason why I must produce dramas, and I have also found the person who pointed it out to me.
And yet, after all that, why did you choose me?
Tell me. If you're there, tell me!
Why is it me?
Why?
!
Ready.
Action!
My face... take a good look.
This face...
don't ever forget.
Cut!
Okay!
Director!
I'm sorry, but can we do it again?
But your eyes were really good just now.
Why? No, my gaze at Jin Hye Rin needs to be full of sadness,
I don't think it was enough this time.
Alright then.
Alright, let's do it one more time.
Carefully look at my face. This face, don't you ever forget.
Cut!
Okay!
Director!
Let's do it one more time.
The Director said it was okay.
Why do you keep asking him to film it again?
Don't pity me.
I'm not saying this out of pity!
Your eyes really did look sad! I appreciate your comforting words, but you have to clearly point out my flaws for my acting to improve so that I can become a good actor.
Director!
Let's do it one last time.
Carefully look at my face. This face, don't you ever forget it.
Cut!
How's this one?
You satisfied?
Yes.
I think it's okay.
Okay.
Then, get ready for scene 38!
Sung Mo!
Script!
Yes, Hyung.
What's wrong with him?
Did something happen?
He wants to get better.
Get better at what?
Acting skills.
Hyun Min said that?
Yes.
I'm going to be worn out, it seems.
Things to do from now on.
What are you doing?
Just some things.
Can we speak... for a bit?
Come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday.
In Search of Lost Time
After so much time has passed, she finally reads the confession the man had left in the book.
And even the book's title is "In Search of Lost Time"
Lee Go Eun ♥ And even the book's title is "In Search of Lost Time"
Lee Go Eun ♥
When did you come?
Just now.
Ah, I see.
I will answer the question you asked yesterday.
It's true that I like you.
I don't know since when, but it's correct that I like you.
I will also ask one question.
Yesterday... why did you cry?
There's something wrong right?
I've been suffering from depression for three years.
That's why I'm crying, so it has nothing to do with you, so don't mind it.
Pretend that the issue of contract renewal never happened.
As if it never happened?
What are you suddently talking about?
There is one reason.
The relationship between a producer and writer should be upright with the right amount of fear and respect.
Since the moment you started liking me, that's impossible.
Working without any emotion, that is my rule.
And that rule is always important.
Then ...
What about Sung Min Ah?
You didn't do that at that time.
But now it's like that.
We can't continue working together.
Does that answer your question somewhat?
I will take my leave.
I have an important appointment.
You've come again.
Hello!
Who ... ?
The writer who came last time.
It's good to meet you. I actually wanted to see you.
Is your body fine?
I heard you weren't well yesterday.
Did my son say that yesterday?
Ah...
I guess I must've heard wrong.
Nowadays is out of control because of the script.
You have a hard time because of my son right?
No, he is so nice to me.
That's good, that you think about him like that. He grew up with a blind single parent, so his personality is _____, but his heart is kind.
I heard...that you couldn't see when he was five...
At that time... my heart hurt so much... At first, my vision started to get blurry, but I thought it would get better over time.
Instead, one eye went blind, and the other eye ended up blind as well.
I found out later that that's how optic neuropathy progresses.
At any rate, you must be a special person to my son.
Huh?
Why do you think so?
Because he told you about things like that.
Ah. To be honest...
I confessed my feelings to the Representative.. .and I got rejected.
My son... by nature, has no vision for women.
Right? !
I mean I'm this pretty...
I think he really doesn't have an eye for girls.
What are you talking about?
That doing business together is going to be hard?
I'm sorry.
Can I ask the reason why you are refusing?
It's a personal issue, so I can't tell you.
I hope that instead of me, you will find a good partner.
Childish! Say if you don't like a person, You're always nagging me about the script.
If you know, hurry up and write the script, everyone is waiting.
I am a crazy girl for worrying about Bong Dal.
Crossing out "cancel the investment deal with Taesan"
Morning of Kyeongsong End of Episode 19
I sent the 19th episode
Got it.
Ah... it's done, but...
Mr. Kang Hyun Min sure will complain about the hair...
The 19th episode came out.
Really?
It came out a lot faster than I thought.
What?
I guess Hyun Min's hairstyle changes, to a shorter haircut.
What? What, what, what?
So you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult.
Could you please change that part this time?
I'm very sorry.
I was concerned about it, too, actually.
You don't think you can persuade him?
It is to signify the start of Kim Woo Jin's choice of an ordinary life.
To tell you the truth, Hyun Min is currently working on getting an endorsement deal for a shampoo.
An endorsement for shampoo?
Yes.
So, if he gets a haircut, he won't be able to do it at all.
Yes.
If it's about an endorsement deal, Kang Hyun Min sure wouldn't want to cut his hair.
Exactly!
I'm sorry, Miss Writer.
I guess it can't be helped.
I'll change it.
Really? Oh, thank you!
Miss Writer Lee!
Writer Lee!
Isn't this Hyun Min's voice?
- Writer Lee!
I guess he's already come to complain.
Writer Lee!
- Don't tell him that I was here!
Writer Lee!
Open this door, now!
Oh heavens!
What do you think?
Is this acceptable?
You got a haircut!
Of course.
A new Woo Jin style.
But, how did you...
Why?
I got it cut after I saw the script.
Do you want it shorter?
Just tell me!
Well, Mr. Hyun Min, weren't you after a shampoo endorsement...?
Who cares about endorsements?
Even if a TV or a car endorsement deal is on the table, if it is for the drama, I should cut it!
With overflowing spirit!
Hyung!
What are you doing here?
Well, actually, to thank her for making your character so awesome.
That's why I'm here.
Is that so?
At any rate, Writer Lee, the last week of Morning in Kyeongseong will be full of this Kang Hyun Min's impactful acting spirit, just you wait.
Fighting!
Fighting!
Director Nam, what do you mean by that? You can't extend Morning in Kyeongseong?
To extend a drama that was originally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we're only doing it for the ratings.
Rather than that, just finishing the drama with its current quality seems to be the better choice, in my judgment.
Listen, Director Nam. "Morning in Kyeongseong" has just gone over 25%, and is on the verge of getting into the 30% range.
If we add 4 more episodes, we'll get the rating over 30% for sure, how can you suggest not doing it? However, if you just prolong the story, it will inevitably lead to a drop in the quality.
In that case, it may ruin what we have accomplished so far with "Morning in Kyeongseong."
Director Nam, are you crazy?
Do you know how much of the profits from commercials depends on 1% of the ratings?
This isn't a place of art!
This is a business that needs to make a profit! Well, Director... - Director Nam,
I understand your point of view, Director Nam. But this time, I would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself.
Four more episodes?
Yes.
I'm surprised by your lack of enthusiasm.
Don't producers usually welcome extension deals in a situation like this?
Yes, we'll make the necessary preparations.
Then...
Why?
Does he think 4 is too short?
No, no.
He says he'll prepare for it.
If we add 4 more episodes, that means 4 more weeks from now, starting with episode 19.
I wonder what the odds are for my eyesight to last until then?
Could I really do it?
No, I must do it.
Please, hang on until then.
Well now, I know how everybody must be tired, but since it's been decided to extend the show, let's do our best to the end! Yes!
Fighting!
What do you think? To spike up the last pitch, new Woo Jin style!
What's with your faces?
Your hair... why did you cut it so soon?
Excuse me?
I cut it too soon? Well, We got an extension of 4 more episodes.
Extension?
Yes.
Well, to prolong the story, the ending will have to change.
Hyun Min, since it's been extended, let's go for 30% of the viewership rating!
I'm counting on you!
What were you doing, not being aware of the extension deal?
My last big impact!
The new haircut of Woo Jin style!
How can you make it all into nothing like this? ! Hyun Min, at any rate, now that it's been decided, let's go for 30% of viewership rating, and get more money for the extended episodes.
Isn't that swell?
Hyung, is money all your concern?
From now on, don't ever insult my passion and spirit for acting with mere money.
Well, then, are you not going to ask for a raise?
How much more did Sung Min Ah ask for? Are you crazy? You know that you're scheduled for a movie right away, and yet you agreed to the extension?
Min Ah, this isn't just any movie, but a movie directed by Cho Kyu Sik.
Besides, you're the lead actress.
You know fully well how your schedule won't allow for both the drama and the movie.
Isn't it your job to make that schedule work?
So, just do as I said.
Who exactly is the reason why you're doing this?
Is it for Anthony? Or,
Kang Hyun Min?
Is it because of him?
Listen carefully.
Don't ever stick me with that moron again!
Got it?
Why do you keep barging in when I didn't call you?
Extension?
Yes.
But I just have one more episode to work on.
How can I add 4 more episodes? In order to write those 4 episodes without sacrificing the quality, we have to revise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday.
Episode 19... uh...
I know it won't be easy.
However, from episode 19 to 24, you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away.
The live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started.
You can do it, right?
I will have to.
Yes. As this is an emergency, put extra effort and write with speed.
Where are you going?
Why?
Well, last time, you came fully loaded even with health supplements. I'm not Writer Kim Soo Hyun or anything, I couldn't possibly write on without discussing the plot, is what you had said.
We should discuss the plot.
This is an emergency.
I'm not doing this because I have ulterior motives.
Did I ask?
The New Episode 19
I'm glad that we got done so fast.
You have to keep this pace from now on.
Ah, before you leave, could you get me a glass of water?
Are you asking me to do that for you?
What can you do?
The writer with high viewership ratings is currently busy writing.
What are you doing?
Can't you see it's overflowing?
You can't even pour me some water?
So don't ask me to do it again!
Did you do it on purpose?
Yes, that's right.
Just move!
It spilled to the floor!
Let's go. Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Are you sure you won't regret it?
What about your dream?
You won't give up? Sung Mo, get your emotions into it!
Go again.
Are you sure you won't regret it?
What about your dream?
You won't give it up?
Ah, this isn't working, either.
I need something to help me get into it.
Are you sure you won't regret?
Are you sure you won't give up on your dream?
As long as you are by my side. Woo Jin,
Woo Jin hugs Hye Rin.
No, no, no!
I can't practice at all like this.
Can't you stop now?
You've been at it for 4 hours already.
We even skipped lunch!
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Instead, I can only give you 2 days a week for your drama.
That's the least you can do, Min Ah.
Of course.
I understand.
Miss Sung Min Ah?
You can answer it.
Oh, there's no need.
It's not an important call.
The phone is turned off, so the voicemail...
Ignoring my calls, huh?
Ok.
We have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the latest.
Yes.
I'm so sorry, Director.
I'll be right back.
Why do you keep calling me?
If only you had answered it the first time.
You're the one who made me call you several times.
I'm in a meeting with a film production.
That's none of my concern.
Just come to the shooting site right now.
Shooting doesn't start until 2 hours from now!
That's why we should get together and practice!
If you don't come now, I'll call the film production myself, got it?
Bye!
He must have really lost his mind!
Victory!
Let's go with this spirit!
Sung Mo!
I'll be back, Gwang Soo.
Hey, what about lunch?
What should I do?
I'm so sorry, Director.
Looks like I have to go now for the shooting schedule today.
It's ok.
You may go.
I'm really sorry. I'll talk to you later, Director.
They must be really going great together.
Yes?
Kang Hyun Min and Min Ah, I mean.
Yes? Ah, no, that's not really... At any rate, there must be no wedding announcements before the movie release.
Yes? Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Let's leave.
Just like any other ...
You're here!
Isn't it really cold outside?
Let's leave.
We should practice it like we're really doing it!
On your feet!
Practice is only practice.
This Kang Hyun Min's acting is for real!
Do you normally practice so casually, Miss Sung Min Ah?
If you really want to do it for real, get rid of that script first.
OK.
Now, ready, action!
Let's leave. Just like any other ordinary couple, let's live like that.
Are you sure you won't regret?
Can you really give up on your dream and live on?
As long as you're with me.
Woo Jin...
Mr. Kang Hyun Min ...
I'm so sorry!
We start shooting in 10 minutes.
What are you doing?
Go and clear up her misunderstanding!
Is that petty little misunderstanding that important?
My burning passion for acting won't die because of it!
Now, one more time.
Why do you have to be so extreme in everything?
I e-mailed you the script for episode 19, Mr. Kim Bong Dal.
Wow, he doesn't even text me back any more.
Start outlining episode 20.
We can't always work on it together.
Since they've worked for me, I know how skilled and faithful they are.
Well, with your recommendation, I know they must be good, Sunbae.
Hm, looks like they have quite some experience?
They've gone through a lot in this field.
They'll be a great asset to you.
You have to pay them at least that much.
At any rate, why are you handing over such great workers? Ah, well, it's because...
Yes, Director.
I just needed to stop at the office.
Yes, I'll be there in about 2 hours.
Hello?
Is this World Production's Joo Dong Suk PD?
Yes, but who is this?
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Drama Production Company Golden Song.
We would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benefits.
Could we have a meeting?
Ah, uh, me?
Yes, I heard that you are very talented.
We'll give you 20% more than your current salary. Ah, yes, well, but, actually, I'm currently working on a project.
Also, to leave my current company all of a sudden seems... Of course, we understand.
You can take your time to consider our offer while finishing up with your current project.
We'll contact you again.
What now? You were so heartbroken by that girl, Did something good happen?
I just got a job offer from another drama production company. Hey, you too?
I got one, too!
Me too!
What?
We all got an offer from somewhere?
Even so, I want to keep working with Representative Kim to the end.
I suppose I will, too.
At any rate, the salary they offered was pretty tempting.
True, after all, our company is on the low side when it comes to salaries in this field.
Speaking of which, I have a good idea.
The four of us can keep our loyalty, but let's ask for a raise of 10%.
Or else, we'll quit.
Threaten him like that in fake?
Yes.
Isn't it great?
I'm in.
I'm in, too.
Are you in?
In.
He's in, too.
What are you doing so huddled up together?
Representative, I have something to tell you.
I'll listen to it later.
I have something to say first.
Once "Morning in Kyeongseong" is finished, I'm going to close my company.
What? I got a partnership offer from Taesan Group, but they didn't want to keep your employment.
By Taesan ... One of the top, leading companies in the country.
Therefore, everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over.
Team Leader Park, you should calculate the severance fee for everyone and put it on my desk.
Hey, what was that?
Did we just get backstabbed?
I heard that wrong, right?
No wonder he had been surprisingly nice to us lately.
What was the number from that other production company?
Crossing out "Transfer employees (close the company)"
Sweet Potato
What?
What else?
I just got done with episode 20.
So, if you're in the office, make a short trip to my studio.
What do you think?
You did pretty well by yourself.
What?
This doesn't make sense.
Where? Scene 38, If Hye Rin is meeting with Representative Kang, is she betraying Woo Jin again?
Ah, that's because there is a surprise element later on.
It's all explained in scene 56.
What is it?
Ah, no, nothing.
What do you think?
Am I right?
Yes, you did well up to the ending.
What?
You didn't even read it to the end!
I read it all.
You just flipped the page, and you read it all?
Yes, speedreading.
Besides, I said it's good.
Why are you complaining?
Just keep writing the script. Starting tomorrow, we'll have to go page by page.
Moonhwa University Hospital, please.
Your condition is progressing much faster than most other patients.
Unfortunately, your right eye has already lost it's sight.
It's already started for your left eye, too.
How long will it take?
For the left eye to lose sight completely?
No.
How much time do I have left? It is difficult to say for sure, but looking at it's current pace, somewhere between 4 weeks and 2 months from now, your left eye will lose sight as well.
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.
He was so careless and rude.
Was I clingy or what?
Is reading this that hard?
Why does it have 2 sheets of page 3?
Then, he didn't get to see scene 56 at all.
What do you think.
Am I right?
Yes, you did well up to the ending.
What?
You didn't even read to the end!
I read it all.
Why did he lie like that?
At first, my vision was just blurry a little.
I thought it would get better over time.
But one eye lost its sight, and eventually, the other one did, too.
What are you doing?
It's overflowing!
What is it?
No, nothing.
I found out later that that's how optic neuropathy progresses.
This can't be!
That's not possible!
Representative!
Are you inside?
How to learn Braille
What to do from now on: 1. Mother 2.
LearnBraille 6.
Care facility for the blind
At least up until now, Writer Lee has been good about not making us do live shooting.
Of course, that ends tomorrow.
Yes.
It's been 5 years since the last time I had to do that dogged live shooting.
Director.
What is it?
Do you think you can finish Morning of Kyeongseong if I am not here?
What do you mean?
Can you do it?
Why?
Does that Taesan or whatever company want you to start working with them sooner?
Yes?
I heard from Joo PD.
I heard that you got a partnership offer there.
Ah, yes.
Go if you must, but only after finishing this.
Even though I have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you, this drama doesn't work even for a day without you, Representative Kim.
Therefore, until this is done, don't even think about running away.
Now, let's pick up the pace!
It's going to get dark soon!
- Yes!
Yes!
Is the preparation for the move going well?
I'm talking about the move to Taesan Group.
When will it be?
Ah, that matter ... I want to send flowers. When is it?
Well, the priority at the moment is "Morning in Kyeongseong."
So just focus on the drama for now.
The date for the move hasn't been decided yet?
We'll get to it eventually.
Then...
ForgetLeeGo Eun
Therelationshipbetweenthe writerandtheproducer requires a balanced tension of fear and respect.
Now that you have started to like me, that's impossible.
Working without any emotion, that is my rule.
And that rule is always important.
Crossingout"ForgetLee GoEun"
Shall we go in?
Too much cold air isn't good for you.
Maybe in just a little bit.
Hello!
You're busy.
Why did you come?
I'm not busy.
My employees are doing all the work.
Still, as the representative, you should be present in the work place.
You shouldn't just leave all the work to your employees.
Mom.
What? When I was young, what was it like when I made fun of you and was mean because you couldn't see?
Wasn't it upsetting?
When was that...such a long time ago.
I'm sorry, Mom.
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Tell me.
Did something bad happen to you?
It's nothing.
Once my current drama is done, I might be off to abroad because my business is going so well.
So stay still. Since I might not be able to see your face for a while,
I want to keep your face in my eyes.
Oh, I see.
It's a good thing that your business is going well.
Instead of worrying, just go and return, because I will be fine.
Your hands are cold.
Let's go inside, Mom.
Yes.
By the way, is that a new scarf?
Yes.
I got it as a gift.
A gift?
From whom?
She begged me not to tell you... Actually, to tell you the truth, I... confessed my feelings to the Representative and got rejected.
Mychild just doesn't have a good eye for women.
That's right.
I'm pretty like this.
I agree that he doesn't have an eye for women.
I brought a present for you.
There's a present?
Yes.
I knit it myself, It keeps you really warm in the winter.
If you look here, it says B D K.
B-D-K?
Yes.
Bong Dal Kim.
You shouldn't do that to such a nice young lady. If it's because you have to go abroad, tell her.
Because it seems to me, she really is a nice girl.
Where have you been?
Did you finish the script?
it's cold. Instead of catching cold again, go in.
How long were you going to conceal it?
Until when were you going to conceal the fact that you are going blind?
You said it was depression.
You said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business.
Correct.
It's none of your business so beat it.
How can it not concern me?
So what?
What can you do for me?
Yes.
What you are saying about my not being able to see is correct.
I won't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom.
I won't be able to see the dramas which I made.
or the scripts either.
I won't be able to see your face And where you are standing, and whether you are smiling or crying
I won't be able to see.
Is that why you are giving up?
What if I say it doesn't matter to me?
For me, it doesn't matter.
We have to endure lack of sleep, script by pages, and miserable life to make sure there's no shame in our every minute, every second and keep us reminded of who we are at this moment.
The last tape of "Morning in Kyeongseong" hasn't made it to the editing room yet.
Even if it's just 1% of hope, that's better than nothing.
A miracle is not something you wait for, but something you create.
The Representative, the Representative, on his way, had an accident...
You must come back with that miracle!
The Finale The Last of the King, or The Last King. Where have you been?
Did you finish the script? Don't catch a cold in this cold weather. Hurry and go in.
Until when are you going to hide that? Until when are you going to hide the fact you're going blind now? You said, what, depression?
Didn't you say it's none of my business so don't bother?
Yes.
It's none of your business, so back off.
Why is it none of my business?
So what?
What can you do for me, then? That's right. As you said, it's true that I won't be able to see any longer.
I won't be able to eat or go to the washroom by myself. I won't be able to see the dramas I made, or your scripts,
or your face either.
Even where you're standing, even whether you're smiling at me or crying,
I won't be able to see all of them.
Is that why you're giving up?
What if I say it still doesn't matter?
I'm saying it doesn't matter to me.
It will be difficult (for you) to endure.
Even so, I want to go that way.
Let's go together.
Maybe, this will be my last time to see the sunrise.
Even if you can't see, I will make you be able to feel it.
And beside you, I will be there.
Even if you can't see the dramas you made, even if you can't see my face or my drama, where you're standing, whether you're smiling at me or crying, I will see all of them.
Since we came all the way here, will we have some time to sleep?
What... what did you say?
Why are you so startled?
Wa... wait!
I... am... not that easy of a woman.
What are you thinking now?
I'm saying let's take a short nap in the car.
Considering that our way back home would be a great hardship, don't you think we should take a nap?
So vulgar!
That's right!
I'm so vulgar!
With this driving skill, how on earth did you get your driving license?
I told you, this is the first time I'm driving since I got the license!
To be precise, this is your second time.
What?
Once to come here, and second time to go back.
If it's your second time, there should be some improvement.
You chickened out!
Just look where you're driving!
Okay. From now on, for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes, we should run around busily making sure they will be aired with no accident.
Even if we have to endure a life like a third-rater with light sleeping and page-by-page scripts, those minutes and seconds of our rrespective moments will make us later remember ourselves in this right moment. The scripts will be handled by Writer Lee and me, so PD Joo, Manager Han, Manager Park and Koo Hee Jae, you guys take care of the filming sites. Yes.
Yes.
Well, then do your best in your post.
Got it?
Yes!
The real problem here is Sung Min Ah, who is currently filming both our drama and a movie. Since Sung Min Ah's schedule isn't favorable, you should write the script minimizing Jin Hye Rin's portion as much as possible.
You can do it, right?
I will even kill Jin Hye Rin if I have to at the last episode to make sure, so don't worry.
The script for Episode 20 arrived!
Did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well?
Yes.
Good. From now on, for all the scripts we will receive, we should film the scenes of Min Ah putting together as much as we can, so organize the schedule accordingly.
Yes.
Well, well, hurry up.
Let's run again!
Yes.
Kim Woo Jin, Kim Woo Jin, Kim Woo Jin, KIM WOO JIN! Sung Mo, - how many scenes in total?
It's 52 vs 36.
Overwhelmingly, you have many more scenes!
Finally, my effort is shining.
The real value of my acting on the screen finally touched Writer Lee. Therefore, Sung Mo, you should try, too.
Find your flaw.
The one who doesn know about one's self would never be able to improve.
Sung Mo, what is your flaw?
Well, I don't know, my flaw is...
Hemorrhoids?
Hemorrhoids?
That...
You just need to go to the hospital to treat it. Well, by the way, Hyung, all those lines, will you be able to memorize them all?
If there are only a few lines, that's the problem, not the other way around.
Taking this opportunity, I should clearly show Kang Hyun Min's burning acting skills!
Let's go.
At the begining of Episode 21, Jin Hye Rin is captured by President Kang.
To save Hye Rin, Kim Woo Jin will fight alone against all the enemies.
So that we can film Jin Hye Rin's scenes at once, all together in a long take?
Exactly!
It can enhance it's dramatic tension and also help us manage the filming schedule.
Kang Hyun Min would have a hard time, though.
Good, let's proceed in that way.
But how are your eyes? Are they alright?
The other side's eye is still fine.
What are you doing now, not writing?
Okay.
Ah, I think I'm really a genius, don't you think so?
But really...when was it that you started to like?
Huh?
When did you start to like me?
What about you?
I asked you first.
So, for me... When there was the argument about plagiarism, you... you said... you would believe me no matter what...
What about you?
I don't remember.
It's not fair!
I told you everything!
Just write your script.
Hurry up and tell me! When was it?
If you don't tell me, I won't write any more.
If you finish your script, then I will tell you.
That's really low.
Did you find that out just now?
Ready, action!
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment.
On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater...
The day we first met ...
Cut!
I will do it again.
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment. On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater, when we aimed a gun at each other...
On that day...
Cut!
Ah!
What was the next line?
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment. On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater, on that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater, even the day when we aimed a gun at each other...
Cut!
Hyun Min!
Let's read the script once and try again.
No, Director!
I can do it!
Let's try again.
No, no.
Let's take a 5-minute break.
Ah!
I really memorized all!
Just use a prompter. What?
Whom do you think is responsible for this?
Are you saying I should cheat for acting, while reading lines from a prompter?
I was just trying to help.
No need.
You seem to think I can't do this, but wait and see.
I will act perfectly after memorizing all the lines.
I have never forgotten about you, not even for a moment. On that day when we first met at Woo Mi Theater, even on that day we aimed a gun at each other.
I have never forgotten about all of them, not even for a moment.
So, please, believe me.
I believe you.
This is the only choice to let us be together.
Cut!
OK!
Hyun Min! Everything was great, including your last stare!
Ha! Of course, who am I! ?
Considering the speed of progress of your disease, it will be a burden if you keep working.
But there is something I must do.
If the blindness is unavoidable, I'm thinking to work as much as I can. Actually, there is something I didn't tell you because I didn't want to give you too much hope.
Recently, in Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Florida, U.S., there was the first clinical trial of DNA treatment for this disease.
Its result showed some patients to be cured, even if its success rate is really low. We don't know when they will announce the start of the second trial, and although when it is announced, it won't be easy for you to be on the list, but I will try my best as well.
Thank you.
Go Eun!
Mom is here.
Oh, you're here!
I'm sorry, but I have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible.
Geez, I won't interrupt, so just keep writing!
Hey, do you have an assistant writer?
No, why?
Then, why do you have two toothbrushes?
Oh, that is...
I haven't seen these before, either.
Wait, aren't these for men?
No, no... that's not... You!
By any chance, that Bong Dal or something, did you let him in here all the time?
No, Mom, that's not the case!
Oh, you're here!
Oh, you came at the right time.
Representative, you said you know the guy named Kim Bong Dal.
Please give me his contact detail.
Ah Mom, that's not the case.
What do you mean that's not the case? Here are two toothbrushes, and even a man's lotion. These are clearly its evidence!
This bastard!
I have to see his face! Ah...
Mother... There must be some misunderstanding.
The guy named Kim Bong Dal isn't that bad.
That's why I'm saying I will meet him.
Mom, later, later, I will introduce him to you later.
Later my ass!
I can just call him myself now.
Mom... MOM!
Here it is!
Bong Dal!
Mom!
It's my alarm.
Give it back to me!
Ah, mom, so... just leave!
Can't you see me not being able to work now?
Anyway, you!
This is a warning!
WARNING!
Hello!
What is this?
What do you mean?
It's a cup of coffee.
Have some.
By the way, why did you write it yesterday?
Over there, on the pillar.
Well, that's because you seemed to have a really hard time, so I just wrote it on there.
Is that all?
Then, of course, that's all.
What else can it be?
Many women don't know their own feelings.
Fine. If your feeling for me is that deep, I won't resist it any longer, not like I did before.
What did you say?
You fell for me, right?
Please, don't have such illusions!
You want to keep your pride?
I also know well about women's pride.
Seriously... what the... Cute. Lovely.
There's a limit to how simpleminded you can get...
What if he starts clinging to me like a leech?
I'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is.
Ridiculous...
Min Ah.
Oh, Director!
I was meaning to call you as well.
I know you're busy.
My schedules are stacked because of the movie and the drama.
Well I'm calling for your next project which we discussed before.
What do you think to work for Writer Kim Eun Sook's drama? (of "Secret Garden""A Gentleman's Dignity")
That'd be excellent if we work with Writer Kim Eun Sook!
But, did the Rep. agree to that?
To work with Writer Kim Eun Sook?
Oh... did you not hear the news yet...? What news? Oh... did you not hear the news yet...?
What news?
Anthony has declined Tae San group's offer due to personal reasons.
What the hell happened?
They're saying you declined Tae San group's investment offer due to personal reasons.
That's correct.
So what exactly is that personal reason?
The reason...
I'll tell you on the day "Morning in Kyeongseong's" last episode airs.
So please finish well.
Cut!
OK!
That was great!
Prepare the next scene!

You've done a great job.
You would want to have a good sleep, but you need to go somewhere with me.
At this late hour?
Change your clothes and come out.
Where?
You're here.
Yes.
Why are you staying there?
Come in.
Who is...?
Hello.
The writer who gave you a scarf present.
I know who it is by her voice.
Welcome.
Mom, I kept my promise.
Okay.
What... promise?
There is something like that.
What is... that promise?
Yes.
I've just received a message from the U.S.
Please come to the hospital as soon as possible.
The second clinical trial's patient list is announced.
You're on that list. As I've told you before, the possibility to avoid your blindness is as low as a miracle, but let's hope for that miracle.
Ah, and the reason I asked you to come here urgently was because you need to leave tomorrow, right away.
Tomorrow?
Yes.
Among the subject patients, there was one patient, who missed the timing to treat and went blind in both eyes, so that's why you could be on that list instead of that patient.
To meet the due date per Florida time, you must leave for Florida tomorrow.
What is that expression about?
