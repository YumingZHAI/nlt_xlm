stephen palumbi : following the mercury trail
it can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task ,
but what i 'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there 's some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple themes aren 't really themes about the complex science of what 's going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i 'm going to start with this one : if momma ain 't happy , ain 't nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we 've experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain 't happy , ain 't nobody happy .
that 's the theme of my talk .
and we 're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
cannery row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
rolf bolin , who was a professor at the hopkin 's marine station where i work , wrote in the 1940s that " the fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . "
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell ,
but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , " you know what you smell ?
you smell money . "
that pollution was money to that community ,
and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages ,
and i want to call that " pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . "
the pyramid of ocean life ...
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
and that 's what we 're trying to preserve
when we say , " save the ocean . heal the ocean . "
it 's that pyramid .
now why does that matter for human health ?
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn 't be there , some very frightening things happen .
pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like pcbs that can 't be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they 're passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators ,
and in so doing , they accumulate .
now , to bring that home , i thought i 'd invent a little game .
we don 't really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it 's the styrofoam and chocolate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two styrofoam peanuts .
can 't do much with them : put them in your pocket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
what 'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
there 's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts .
and that 's exactly what happens with pdbs in this food pyramid :
they accumulate into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around ,
and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group
because they 're absorbed by us .
and that 's the difference between a pcb and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
pcbs accumulate .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay , in texas , in north carolina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolphins eat the fish that have pcbs from the plankton , and those pcbs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there 's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .
and what 's that ?
in mother 's milk .
here 's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
adult males : a huge load .
juveniles : a huge load .
females after their first calf is already weaned : a lower load .
those females , they 're not trying to .
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother 's milk into their offspring ,
and their offspring don 't survive .
the death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant ,
and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
there 's another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
that top predator , of course , is us .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
that 's another story .
but some of them were not whale meat at all .
even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
some of them were dolphin liver . some of them were dolphin blubber .
and those dolphin parts had a huge load of pcbs , dioxins and heavy metals .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
that 's a tragedy for those populations ,
but it 's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don 't know that that 's toxic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
it had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , " well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , "
but it was so awful .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
we sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of japan
because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan ,
and i 'm really proud to say that at this point , it 's very difficult to buy anything in japan that 's labeled incorrectly , even though they 're still selling whale meat , which i believe they shouldn 't .
but at least it 's labeled correctly ,
and you 're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
it isn 't just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
these women have toxic breast milk .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world 's ocean pyramid .
that means their immune systems are compromised .
it means that their children 's development can be compromised .
and the world 's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we 've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
that 's a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
there 's other ways of breaking the pyramid .
the pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that 's clogged .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we 've heard about before : red tides , for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
we can also see blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
how many people have seen a " beach closed " sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .
often what jams us up is sewage .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , " closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can 't use it " ?
not very often . we wouldn 't tolerate that .
we wouldn 't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage ,
but beaches are closed a lot in our country . they 're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason ,
and i believe we shouldn 't tolerate that either .
it 's not just a question of cleanliness ;
it 's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infections .
this is a graph from noaa 's ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather 's like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
that means that the beach might have great waves , but it 's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now ,
and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don 't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
copepods are small crustaceans .
they 're a tiny fraction of an inch long ,
and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn 't move these vectors of cholera around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
well , there 's a bunch of things you could do .
you could call joe the plumber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
but in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .
monterey is one of those .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
in 1932 , that 's the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
but there 's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
and that pyramid in monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it 's ever functioned for the last 150 years .
it didn 't happen accidentally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
on the left there , julia platt , the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove .
at 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
in 1931 , she produced california 's first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed ,
and she wanted to provide that seed .
other people , like david packard and julie packard , who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people 's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we 're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid ,
and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
it 's an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,
but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
and it 's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jessa _ gamble _ how _ to _ sleep.html
in today 's world , balancing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep . examining the science behind our body 's internal clock , jessa gamble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be observing .
evolution , humanity , personal growth , science , self
957
jessa gamble : our natural sleep cycle
let 's start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clocks , and they 're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i 'll give you an example --
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it 'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
it 'll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
and it 's incredible to watch , but there 's nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it 's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what 's going on around it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and in humans , we call it the " body clock . "
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone 's watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
so , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it 's incredibly important in our lives .
it 's a huge driver for culture and i think that it 's the most underrated force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we 're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
but of course , we 've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
in winter , there 's a lot of sleeping going on ;
you enjoy your family life inside .
and in summer , it 's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
what would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m .
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
and in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
and during this time , there 's a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they 're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we 're living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / handpring _ puppet _ co _ the _ genius _ puppetry _ behind _ war _ horse.html
" puppets always have to try to be alive , " says adrian kohler of the handspring puppet company , a gloriously ambitious troupe of human and wooden actors . beginning with the tale of a hyena 's subtle paw , puppeteers kohler and basil jones build to the story of their latest astonishment : the wonderfully life-like joey , the war horse , who trots convincingly onto the ted stage .

handspring puppet co . : the genius puppetry behind war horse
adrian kohler : well , we 're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse .
basil jones : but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hyena .
ak : the ancestor of the horse .
okay , we 'll do something with it .
hahahaha .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called " faustus in africa , " a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .
so it needed a very articulate front paw .
but , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
bj : one of them is breath , and it kind of breathes .
ak : haa haa haaa .
bj : breath is really important for us .
it 's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
it 's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- ak : oops .
bj : from an actor .
puppets always have to try to be alive .
it 's their kind of ur-story onstage , that desperation to live .
ak : yeah , it 's basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor struggles to die onstage , but a puppet has to struggle to live .
and in a way that 's a metaphor for life .
bj : so every moment it 's on the stage , it 's making the struggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs .
ak : well actually i prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
bj : okay so .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
bj : and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that adrian 's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop . ak : in port elizabeth , the village outside port elizabeth in south africa .
bj : his mother was a puppeteer .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 , i hated puppets .
i really thought they were so beneath me .
i wanted to become an avant-garde artist -- and punch and judy was certainly not where i wanted to go . and , in fact , it took about 10 years
to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa , where there 's a fabulous tradition of puppetry , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
and 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from mali , the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe .
it was just called " tall horse , " which was a life-sized giraffe .
bj : and here again , you see the same structure .
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane , but it 's ultimately the same structure .
it 's got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who 's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
ak : the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail , a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism , just a bit bigger .
and he 's controlling the ear movement .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
and just around that time , his mother had said , " have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called ' war horse ' ? "
ak : it 's about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
bj : so tom gave us a call and said , " do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ? "
ak : it seemed a lovely idea .
bj : but it had to ride . it had to have a rider .
ak : it had to have a rider , and it had to participate in cavalry charges .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
but they agreed to go along with it for a while .
so we began with a test .
bj : this is adrian and thys stander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor katherine , riding on a ladder .
the weight is really difficult when it 's up above your head .
ak : and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a horse , which could be ridden .
so we made a model .
this is a cardboard model , a little bit smaller than the hyena .
you 'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there .
bj : and the two manipulators are inside .
but we didn 't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator , because we couldn 't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
ak : we started work on the prototype after the model was approved , and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated .
we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones .
and we had a crate built for it .
it had to be shipped to london .
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we hadn 't done that yet .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
and we sent it off to the national theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
bj : about 40 people .
ak : we were terrified .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
this is in the national theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the choreographer , toby sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
and nick starr , the director of the national theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there .
the horses are completely handmade .
there is very little 20th century technology in them .
we used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can 't be mass-produced , unfortunately .
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
joey boy , you there ?
joey .
joey .
joey , come here .
no , no , i haven 't got it .
he 's got it ; it 's in his pocket .
bj : joey .
ak : joey , joey , joey , joey .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
i 'd just like to describe -- i won 't talk too loud . he might get irritated .
here , craig is working the head .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
when they point right back , the horse is fearful or angry , depending upon what 's going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he 's more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
horses ' hearing is very important .
it 's almost more important than their eyesight .
over here , tommy 's got what you call the heart position .
he 's working the leg .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena 's front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
horses are so unpredictable .
the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it 's a convincing horse action .
the hind legs have got the same action .
bj : and mikey also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
and together , there 's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
ak : you want to say something about the breathing ?
bj : we had a big challenge with breathing .
adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that 's how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn 't , as an audience , see the breath .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
so it 's anti-naturalistic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
and it 's very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
ak : other emotional stuff .
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver .
you 'll notice , of course , that the puppet is made out of cane lines .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
but of course , it was the cane is light , the cane is flexible , the cane is durable and the cane is moldable .
and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane .
the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
again , that was a practical consideration .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production . and it 's very much an in-the-moment activity that they 're engaged in .
it 's three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put joey through some paces .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who 's going to ride the horse for us . so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
bj : not being able to talk to one another while they 're onstage because they 're mic 'd .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
ak : mikey brett from leicestershire .
mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
thank you . thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / katherine _ fulton _ you _ are _ the _ future _ of _ philanthropy.html
in this uplifting talk , katherine fulton sketches the new future of philanthropy -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is scarce . giving five practical examples of crowd-driven philanthropy , she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders .

katherine fulton : you are the future of philanthropy
i want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
and in doing that , i want to offer you a vision , an imagined future , if you will , of how , as the poet seamus heaney has put it , " once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhyme . "
i want to start with these word pairs here .
we all know which side of these we 'd like to be on .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn 't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse .
and in fact they weren 't . they were reinventing charity in those times ,
what rockefeller called " the business of benevolence . "
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that 's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions ,
for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
and it 's driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we 've seen here , and by new pressures .
i 've been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
and as i do that , i 'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the soros or the google .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us :
the democratization of philanthropy .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what i 'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
he said , " we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . " watch , this spring , for paul hawken 's new book --
author and entrepreneur many of you may know about .
the book is called " blessed unrest . "
and when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label wiser , are going to launch at the same time .
wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history :
humanity 's collective immune response to today 's threats .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren 't going to take off .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
second category is online philanthropy marketplaces .
this is , of course , to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce .
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
and this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
take a look , if you haven 't , at donorschoose .
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose .
it 's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at changing the present , started by a tedster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
giveindia is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third category is represented by warren buffet ,
which i call aggregated giving .
it 's not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
it 's that he challenged another assumption , that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
one of the best known is acumen fund , led by jacqueline novogratz , a tedster who got a big boost here at ted .
but there are many others : new profit in cambridge , new school 's venture fund in silicon valley , venture philanthropy partners in washington , global fund for women in san francisco .
take a look at these .
these funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing ,
but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at acumen and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .
and understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is .
it 's not about foundations necessarily ; it 's about the rest of us .
and imagine the mash-up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it 's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe ,
thereby engaging lots of people , and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that 's stated .
i 'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
they 're betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
this tackles yet another assumption , that the giver and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
that leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all ,
represented here by xigi.net .
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
xigi is a new community site that 's built by the community , linking and mapping this new social capital market .
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
now , what 's really interesting here is that we 're not thinking our way into a new way of acting ;
we 're acting our way into a new way of thinking .
philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don 't yet fulfill this aspiration , i think this is the new zeitgeist : open , big , fast , connected ,
and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don 't develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fad .
but i 'm really hopeful .
and i 'm hopeful because it 's not only philanthropy that 's reorganizing itself ,
it 's also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging " business as usual . "
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing . what we 're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that 's happening .
words like " philanthrocapitalism , " and " natural capitalism , " and " philanthroentrepreneur , " and " venture philanthropy . "
we don 't have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it 's new , it 's beginning , and i think it 's gong to quite significant .
and that 's where my imagined future comes in ,
which i am going to call the social singularity .
many of you will realize that i 'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge 's notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most :
a convergence of catastrophes , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty .
that 's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
and as we 've heard here , it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social singularity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn 't have to be imagined .
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individually and collectively , hasn 't prepared us for what we 're going to need to do , or who we 're going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
that 's why i have one last thing i want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
i keep this photograph close by to me --
it 's in my office --
because i 've always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
and so , in their honor , i want to offer you this blank slide .
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating . whatever that means to you .
and i want you to imagine that it 's 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
what is the story you most want for them to tell ?
thank you very much .

chris gerdes : the future race car -- 150mph , and no driver
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn 't have been driving ?
maybe you 're out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , i 've had less to drink than everybody else , i should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situations , wouldn 't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
now , that 's been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it 's been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair .
now , it 's been one of those dreams that 's always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google 's self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it 's legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
now , california 's considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas .
now , in my lab at stanford , we 've been working on autonomous cars too , but with a slightly different spin on things . you see , we 've been developing robotic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there 's two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
now , if you 're like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that 's a very high bar .
there 's another reason as well .
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road , all of the car 's capabilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast , but because you 've hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
i must confess , there 's kind of a third motivation as well .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
in the past , i 've been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you 're currently expecting .
one of the things that we 've developed in the lab -- we 've developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car .
it 's another one of those categories where maybe there 's not a lot of competition .
but this is p1 . it 's an entirely student-built electric vehicle , which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle , on shelley , an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats , gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel .
i guess it goes without saying that we 've had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there 's something else that we 've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
as we 've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform , we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts .
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some iteration , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable .
yes , there are subtle differences here , but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade-off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
not only that , they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap .
they 're able to go out and consistently do this , pushing the car to the limits every single time .
it 's extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few laps , they 've found the fastest line in that car , and they 're off to the races .
it really makes you think , we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that 's what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
john morton is a former can-am and imsa driver , who 's also a class champion at le mans .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she 's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john 's brain as he races around the track .
now , clearly we 're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
in contrast , theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves .
this gives us a measure of mental workload , how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to laguna seca .
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey .
it has a curve there called the corkscrew .
now , the corkscrew is a chicane , followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the revs program at stanford , we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 porsche abarth carrera .
life is way too short for boring cars .
so , here you see john on the track , he 's going up the hill -- oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches .
now watch , he has to downshift .
and then he has to turn left .
look for the tree , and down .
not surprisingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
but what 's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn 't increase .
i 'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and john 's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he 's going to have to correct for that with steering .
so watch as john does this here .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
not a challenging task .
in fact , entirely reflexive .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles .
we 've started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
but it 's made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we 're all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technological future , i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let 's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .

stefana broadbent : how the internet enables intimacy
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of " democratization of intimacy . "
and what do i mean by that ?
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
how are they doing this ? they 're doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by iming from their office to their friends , by texting under the desk .
the pictures that you 're seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grandfather .
for 20 years , i 've been looking at how people use channels such as email , the mobile phone , texting , etc . what we 're actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
recently some sociologists from facebook -- facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels .
and an average user , said cameron marlow , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and when you go to skype , it 's down to two people .
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
i mean , i 've been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
and some sociologists actually feel that it 's a closure , it 's a cocooning , that we 're disengaging from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they 're doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
the first gentleman , he 's a baker . and so he starts working every morning at four o 'clock in the morning .
and around eight o 'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven , cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that 's the start of her day .
and i 've heard this story a number of times .
a young factory worker who works night shifts , who manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is cctv by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o 'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight .
or a mother who , at four o 'clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
then there is another couple , there is a brazilian couple .
they 've lived in italy for a number of years .
they skype with their families a few times a week .
but once a fortnight , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo . and they have a big event of it .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
they had set up a big screen in their living room ,
and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
but danny miller , who is a very good anthropologist who is working on filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the philippines , was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype , and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through skype .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they 've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and this is exactly what we 've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
so , think of the three settings i 've talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
but it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
three settings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clocked in , when you clocked in to an office , when you clocked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole duration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere .
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage .
if you think nursery , kindergarten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
and then the school enacts perfectly well . it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms in this country , things that identify you , team-building activities ,
team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
they were living on top of the land they were laboring .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and if you think , it 's permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medieval cities , medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and they are doing it massively .
the pew institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that -- and i think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
i really think that the number is conservative .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o 'clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
i 'm always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cringe , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immediate dismissal to bus drivers in new york , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .

majora carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
so today , i 'm going to tell you about some people who didn 't move out of their neighborhoods .
the first one is happening right here in chicago .
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
but brenda , not being phased by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn 't to me .
it 's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at whole foods .
she combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like anger-management and teamwork , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more .
less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail .
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
talk about a sweet beginning .
now , i 'm going to take you to los angeles ,
and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
but i 'm going to talk about l.a. ' s water issues right now .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains .
currently , 20 percent of california 's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california .
their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well .
now andy lipkis is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees , people and technology to create a more livable city .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air-conditioning , or is it a cooler room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn 't make that much of a difference .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
so ultimately , 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net-savings to the system , but also healthier students and schools system employees as well .
now judy bonds is a coal miner 's daughter .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father 's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years ' worth of coal .
that kind of technology is called " mountaintop removal . "
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it 's filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs , or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region 's wind .
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it 's a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it 's a longer payback than mountaintop removal , but the wind energy actually pays back forever .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
the water is turned into goo .
most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor heath , as well .
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious alliance .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called whitesville , west virginia .
i mean , they are not -- they ain 't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , " save the endangered hillbillies . "
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it 's all about .
but just a few months ago , judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer .
yeah .
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
and i just find it so bizarre that she 's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
but rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something , she 's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that 's what my homegirl is doing .
so i 'm so proud of that .
but these three people don 't know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they 're all problem solvers , and they 're just some of the many examples that i really am privileged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now .
i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio radio show called thepromisedland.org .
now they 're all very practical visionaries .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money 's flowing to meet those demands .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you 're left with unemployed people , and those people aren 't cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens , and they include generationally impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the middle east , people coming out of jail .
and for the veterans in particular , the v.a. said there 's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003 .
i think that number 's probably going to go up .
they 're not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive --
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
so these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
and there are plenty of other examples like that .
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and we know that eco-industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there 's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another , or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and in my hometown , we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx , but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail . they 've since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system .
it relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration .
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
and so we know " urban ag " is a big buzz topic this time of the year , but it 's mostly gardening , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it 's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the numbers just aren 't there .
part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city , that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities , owned and operated by small growers , where now there are only consumers .
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can 't meet the year-round demand for produce .
it 's not a competition with rural farm ; it 's actually reinforcements .
it allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
the goal is to meet the cities ' institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , daycare centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , drop-out rates , incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
so i 'm hoping you can see a little theme here .
these examples indicate a trend .
i haven 't created it , and it 's not happening by accident .
i 'm noticing that it 's happening all over the country , and the good news is that it 's growing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
it is an essential pillar to this country 's recovery .
and i call it " hometown security . "
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there 's something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
it 's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighbors -- be they next-door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- will be just fine .
the sum of the local is the global .
hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses , putting people to work , restoring our natural systems .
hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas . tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america .
the challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more .
now , hometown security is about taking care of your own , but it 's not like the old saying , " charity begins at home . "
i recently read a book called " love leadership " by john hope bryant .
and it 's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was gambling , compulsively .
to him that phrase , " charity begins at home , " meant that my payday -- or someone else 's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that i grew up in .
so i 'm not that unhappy about that .
but listen , i did feel obligated to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
and i 'm a grown woman now ,
and i have learned a few things along the way .
to me , charity often is just about giving , because you 're supposed to , or because it 's what you 've always done , or it 's about giving until it hurts .
i 'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i 'm not trying to feed the habit .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and over the past 20 years , we 've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems , yet educational outcomes , malnutrition , incarceration , obesity , diabetes , income disparity , they 've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular , infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it 's a great world that we 're bringing them into as well .
and i know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , i spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex ,
and i 'm a recovering executive director , two years clean .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foundations .
and i tell you , being on the ted stage and winning a macarthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that i had arrived .
and by the time i 'd moved on , i was actually covering a third of my agency 's budget deficit with speaking fees .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing .
but i did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
the south bronx greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here .
and we love this , because i love construction now , because we 're watching these things actually happen .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
hometown security is next on my to-do list .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
it 's time to stop building the shopping malls , the prisons , the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures .
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .

britta riley : a garden in my apartment
i , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities .
and there are days -- i don 't know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i palpably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
and some days , that can even be a little scary .
but what i 'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
now at the time that i was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment .
so i was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article -- was it 's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system .
so , i happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space .
and you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants ' root systems .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors .
and the way it works is that there 's a pump at the bottom , which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top , which then trickles down through plants ' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there 's no dirt involved .
now light and temperature vary with each window 's microclimate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically .
back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing .
and i really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people 's food .
so i decided that , instead of creating a product , what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers .
the first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window .
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff .
but the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved .
so to bring on more co-developers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
so actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
and we have window farms all over the world .
what we 're doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r & d , or research and development .
but what we call it is r & d-i-y , or research and develop it yourself .
so for example , jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half .
tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he 's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients .
and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they 're now making open source and part of the project .
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
and with every open source project , the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
and we 're able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
and there 's a patent pending on these systems as well that 's held by the community .
and to fund the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don 't have time to build their own systems .
now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
in our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else 's idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
what we get out of this project is we get support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs .
but i think that eileen expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
so she expresses here what it 's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we 're all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term " consumer " and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
and what we 're seeing is that r & d-i-y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems .
and we 're building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
and we 're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now .
so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pioneers .

nicholas negroponte on one laptop per child , two years on
most people don 't know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
my family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , " well , that 's ok , but you 've done very well in your math sats . " in fact , i 'd got an 800 . and he thought i did very well -- and i did , too -- in the arts :
this was my passion .
and he said " if you go to mit , " to which i had been given early admission , " i will pay for every year you 're at mit , in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris . " and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accepted it immediately .
and i decided that if i was good in art , and i was good in mathematics , i 'd study architecture , which was the blending of the two .
i went and told my headmaster that , at prep school .
and i said to him what i was doing , that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , " you know , i like grey suits , and i like pin-striped suits , but i don 't like grey pin-striped suits . " and i thought , " what a turkey this guy is , " and i went off to mit .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn 't architecture .
that really , the mixing of art and science was computers ,
and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin 's scale , i 'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , " well , maybe it 's time for me to do a project . something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . " and in the case of the media lab , knowing a lot of people ,
knowing people who were either executives or wealthy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , i mean , i 'd done my career .
didn 't have to worry about earning money . didn 't have to worry about what people thought about me .
and i said , " boy , let 's really do something that takes advantage of all these features , " and thought that if we could address education , by leveraging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be sued for it . it 's taken at three o 'clock in the morning , without the permission of the company .
it 's about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
if you look at the picture , you 'll see they 're stacked up .
those are conveyor belts that go around .
this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by , but then you 'll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you 've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it 's constant .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the ibm pc was even announced .
seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools
and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , " who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? " i say to myself , " what planet do you come from ? " okay , there 's not a person in this room -- i don 't care how techie you are -- there 's not a person in this room that doesn 't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago . seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 , and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called " teaching children thinking . " what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they debug the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we 've lost that .
kids don 't program enough and boy , if there 's anything i hope this brings back , it 's programming to kids .
it 's really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squeak , logo , and a third , that i 've never even seen before .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
this photograph is very important because it 's much later .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who 's here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
this is the same village in cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold .
there are many reasons , but the two that merit the little bit of time is : one , the clarity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
i can see any head of state , any executive i want , at any time , because i 'm not selling laptops . ok ? i have no shareholders .
whether we sell , it doesn 't make any difference whatsoever . the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search firms , including communications , including legal services , including banking , they 're all pro bono . and it 's not to save money .
we 've got money in the bank . it 's because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they 're the best people .
we couldn 't afford to hire a cfo . we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary , and we had a queue of people .
it allows you to team up with people . the u.n. ' s not going to be our partner if we 're profit making . so announcing this with kofi annan was very important , and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar .
and while this machine in some sense is silly , in retrospect , it actually served a very important purpose .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank . it 's different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it 's kind of childlike .
even though this wasn 't the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
in spite of what some people in the press don 't get it , didn 't understand it , we didn 't take it off because we didn 't want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adaptor .
i didn 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off-board .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , " gee , you 've got a real computer . " that computer is unlike anything you 've had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don 't come close to . and it 's very important to be low power , and i hope that 's picked up more by the industry .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that 's roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display 's fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight , and the more sunlight the better .
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it 'll become commonplace .
and of course , " rugged " goes without saying .
and the reason i think design matters isn 't because i wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when i graduated from mit , i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years .
so , i didn 't do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
and , in english , the word " cheap " has a double meaning , which is really appropriate ,
because it 's cheap , in the pejorative sense , as well as inexpensive .
but if you take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you 're pouring chemicals in one end , ipods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design , that 's what we wanted to do .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn 't compare notes .
these are his slides , and so i don 't have to talk about them .
but it was really , to us , very important as a strategy .
it wasn 't just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
yves showed one of the power-generating devices .
the mesh network , the reason i -- and i won 't go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world , they 're connected . there 's not just laptops .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
it 's a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you 're in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
if you 're in the jungle , it 's about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they 're going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they 're not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don 't call verizon or sprint . you build your own network .
and that 's very important , the user interface .
we are launching with 18 keyboards . english is by far the minority .
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
i 'm willing to suspect some of you hadn 't even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with olpc , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that 's on the screen ? there 's only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you 're right . he 's right . it 's amharic , it 's ethiopian . in ethiopia , there 's never been a keyboard .
there is no keyboard standard because there 's no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you 're a nonprofit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to ethiopia , and we helped them make a keyboard .
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it 's not what we 're doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it 's rich .
here 's the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he 'd do a million .
in the case of qaddafi , he 'd do 1.2 million , and that they would launch it .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 330 days per year .
not something you 'd envy or want to do .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting qaddafi in his tent .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean , this was not what you 'd call a cool experience . and former countries -- i say former , because none of them really came through this summer --
there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release . so we went to smaller ones . uruguay , bless their hearts .
small country , not so rich . president said he 'd do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to olpc .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in peru , the president of peru said , " we 'll do 250 . " and boom , a little domino effect .
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
and boom , boom , boom . the president of mongolia .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries --
still not enough .
add up all those countries , it didn 't quite get to thing , so we said , " let 's start a program in the united states . " so , end of august , early september , we decide to do this . we announced it near the middle , end --
just when the clinton initiative was taking place .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
launched it on the 12 of november .
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . we 've extended it until the 31 .
and the " give one , get one " program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , " well , let 's get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . " and that 's where you come in .
and that 's where i think it 's very important . i don 't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops . okay ? do it , but that 's not going to help . okay ?
if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah , great .
i want you do something else .
and it 's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
tell people about it ! it 's got to become viral , ok ?
use your mailing lists . people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .
get your friends to give one , get one .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
i won 't dwell on the pricing at all .
just to say that when you do the " give one , get one , " a lot of press is a bit about , " they didn 't make it , it 's 188 dollars , it 's not 100 . " it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
we 've pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons . so what you can do -- i 've just said it . don 't just give one , get one .
i just want to end with one last one . this one is not even the first kids got their laptops . they got them by ship , and i 'm talking now about 7,000 , 8,000 at a time went out this week .
they went to uruguay , peru , mexico .
and it 's been slow coming , and we 're only making about 5,000 a week , but we hope , we hope , sometime in next year , maybe by the middle of the year , to hit a million a month . now put that number , and a million isn 't so much . it 's not a big number .
we 're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
and the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . so i 'm standing here telling you that sometime next year , we 're going to make 20 percent of the world production .
and if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
and we hope if you have eg two years from now , or whenever you have it again , i won 't have bad breath , and i will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
thank you .

rodney brooks says robots will invade our lives
what i want to tell you about today is how i see robots invading our lives at multiple levels , over multiple timescales .
and when i look out in the future , i can 't imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we don 't have robots everywhere . assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we 're still around , i can 't imagine the world not being populated with robots .
and then the question is , well , if they 're going to be here in 500 years , are they going to be everywhere sooner than that ?
are they going to be around in 50 years ?
yeah , i think that 's pretty likely -- there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere .
and in fact i think that 's going to be a lot sooner than that .
i think we 're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common , and i think we 're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years , where the first few robots are starting to appear .
computers sort of came around through games and toys .
and you know , the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong , a little microprocessor embedded , and then other games that came after that .
and we 're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots : lego mindstorms , furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a furby ?
yeah , there 's 38 million of them sold worldwide .
they are pretty common . and they 're a little tiny robot , a simple robot with some sensors ,
a little bit of processing actuation .
on the right there is another robot doll , who you could get a couple of years ago .
and just as in the early days , when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers , you can now get various hacking kits , how-to-hack books .
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics , where you put a pc on , and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff .
and then there 's a higher price point sort of robot toys -- the sony aibo . and on the right there , is one that the nec developed , the papero , which i don 't think they 're going to release .
but nevertheless , those sorts of things are out there .
and we 've seen , over the last two or three years , lawn-mowing robots , husqvarna on the bottom , friendly robotics on top there , an israeli company .
and then in the last 12 months or so we 've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear .
the top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called dyson , in the u.k. except it was so expensive -- 3,500 dollars -- they didn 't release it .
but at the bottom left , you see electrolux , which is on sale .
another one from karcher .
at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago , and we finally turned that into a product .
and let me just show you that .
we 're going to give this away i think , chris said , after the talk .
this is a robot that you can go out and buy , and that will clean up your floor .
and it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles .
if it hits something -- you people see that ?
now it 's doing wall-following , it 's following around my feet to clean up around me . let 's see , let 's -- oh , who stole my rice krispies ? they stole my rice krispies ! don 't worry , relax , no , relax , it 's a robot , it 's smart !
see , the three-year-old kids , they don 't worry about it .
it 's grown-ups that get really upset .
we 'll just put some crap here .
okay .
i don 't know if you see -- so , i put a bunch of rice krispies there , i put some pennies , let 's just shoot it at that , see if it cleans up .
yeah , ok . so -- we 'll leave that for later .
part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism , actually ; the intelligence on board was fairly simple .
and that 's true with a lot of robots .
we 've all , i think , become , sort of computational chauvinists , and think that computation is everything , but the mechanics still matter .
here 's another robot , the packbot , that we 've been building for a bunch of years .
it 's a military surveillance robot , to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves , for instance .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
on board that robot is a pc running linux .
it can withstand a 400g shock . the robot has local intelligence : it can flip itself over , can get itself into communication range , can go upstairs by itself , et cetera .
okay , so it 's doing local navigation there .
a soldier gives it a command to go upstairs , and it does .
that was not a controlled descent .
now it 's going to head off .
and the big breakthrough for these robots , really , was september 11th .
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening .
couldn 't do a lot in the main rubble pile , things were just too -- there was nothing left to do .
but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated , and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into .
let 's run this video .
reporter : ... battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks .
nick robertson has that story .
rodney brooks : can we have another one of these ?
okay , good .
so , this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously .
he 's sending robots into caves , looking at what 's going on .
the robot 's being totally autonomous .
the worst thing that 's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters .
so one year ago , the us military didn 't have these robots .
now they 're on active duty in afghanistan every day .
and that 's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening .
there 's a sea change happening in how -- where technology 's going .
thanks .
and over the next couple of months , we 're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground .
very hostile environments , 150 ˚ c , 10,000 psi .
autonomous robots going down , doing this sort of work .
but robots like this , they 're a little hard to program .
how , in the future , are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use ?
and i want to actually use a robot here -- a robot named chris -- stand up . yeah . okay .
come over here . now notice , he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff .
he sort of does that . but i 'm going to -- chris anderson : i 'm just british . rb : oh .
i 'm going to show this robot a task . it 's a very complex task .
now notice , he nodded there , he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication .
and if i 'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me , and regulated the conversation .
so now i brought this up in front of him .
i 'd looked at his eyes , and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top .
and i 'm doing this task here , and he 's checking up .
his eyes are going back and forth up to me , to see what i 'm looking at -- so we 've got shared attention .
and so i do this task , and he looks , and he looks to me to see what 's happening next . and now i 'll give him the bottle , and we 'll see if he can do the task . can you do that ?
okay . he 's pretty good . yeah . good , good , good .
i didn 't show you how to do that .
now see if you can put it back together .
and he thinks a robot has to be really slow .
good robot , that 's good .
so we saw a bunch of things there .
we saw when we 're interacting , we 're trying to show someone how to do something , we direct their visual attention .
the other thing communicates their internal state to us , whether he 's understanding or not , regulates a social interaction .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
and we 've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you 're going to want to interact with robots in the future .
i just want to show you one technical diagram here .
the most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system .
because what it pays attention to is what it 's seeing and interacting with , and what you 're understanding what it 's doing .
so in the videos i 'm about to show you , you 're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has -- it looks for skin tone in hsv space , so it works across all human colorings .
it looks for highly saturated colors , from toys .
and it looks for things that move around .
and it weights those together into an attention window , and it looks for the highest-scoring place -- the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening --
and that is what its eyes then segue to .
and it looks right at that .
at the same time , some top-down sort of stuff : might decide that it 's lonely and look for skin tone , or might decide that it 's bored and look for a toy to play with .
and so these weights change .
and over here on the right , this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module .
did people see the movie " ai " ?
rb : yeah , it was really bad , but -- remember , especially when haley joel osment , the little robot , looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it ?
well , this gets rid of that , because this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative , and more and more intense as it looks at one thing .
and it gets bored , so it will then look away at something else .
so , once you 've got that -- and here 's a robot , here 's kismet , looking around for a toy . you can tell what it 's looking at .
you can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera , and you can tell when it 's actually seeing the toy .
and it 's got a little bit of an emotional response here .
but it 's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view -- such as cynthia breazeal , the builder of this robot , from the right .
it sees her , pays attention to her .
kismet has an underlying , three-dimensional emotional space , a vector space , of where it is emotionally .
and at different places in that space , it expresses -- can we have the volume on here ?
can you hear that now , out there ?
kismet : do you really think so ? do you really think so ?
do you really think so ?
rb : so it 's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice .
and when i was dealing with my robot over here , chris , the robot , was measuring the prosody in my voice ,
and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically .
here we 've got naive subjects praising the robot : voice : nice robot .
you 're such a cute little robot .
rb : and the robot 's reacting appropriately .
voice : ... very good , kismet .
voice : look at my smile .
rb : it smiles . she imitates the smile . this happens a lot .
these are naive subjects .
here we asked them to get the robot 's attention and indicate when they have the robot 's attention .
voice : hey , kismet , ah , there it is .
rb : so she realizes she has the robot 's attention .
voice : kismet , do you like the toy ? oh .
rb : now , here they 're asked to prohibit the robot , and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner .
voice : no . no . you 're not to do that . no .
not appropriate . no . no .
rb : i 'm going to leave it at that .
we put that together . then we put in turn taking .
when we talk to someone , we talk .
then we sort of raise our eyebrows , move our eyes , give the other person the idea it 's their turn to talk .
and then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other .
so we put this in the robot .
we got a bunch of naive subjects in , we didn 't tell them anything about the robot , sat them down in front of the robot and said , talk to the robot .
now what they didn 't know was , the robot wasn 't understanding a word they said , and that the robot wasn 't speaking english .
it was just saying random english phonemes .
and i want you to watch carefully , at the beginning of this , where this person , ritchie , who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes -- -- says , " i want to show you something .
i want to show you my watch . "
and he brings the watch center , into the robot 's field of vision , points to it , gives it a motion cue , and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully .
we don 't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- notice the turn-taking .
ritchie : ok , i want to show you something . ok , this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me .
robot : oh , cool .
ritchie : yeah , look , it 's got a little blue light in it too . i almost lost it this week .
rb : so it 's making eye contact with him , following his eyes .
ritchie : can you do the same thing ? robot : yeah , sure .
rb : and they successfully have that sort of communication .
and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing .
this is another robot , cog .
they first make eye contact , and then , when christie looks over at this toy , the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at .
so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs .
but then the big questions , two big questions that people ask me are : if we make these robots more and more human-like , will we accept them , will we -- will they need rights eventually ?
and the other question people ask me is , will they want to take over ?
and on the first -- you know , this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies . you probably recognize these characters here -- where in each of these cases , the robots want more respect .
well , do you ever need to give robots respect ?
they 're just machines , after all .
but i think , you know , we have to accept that we are just machines .
after all , that 's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .
you don 't see a description of how , you know , molecule a , you know , comes up and docks with this other molecule .
and it 's moving forward , you know , propelled by various charges , and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect .
it 's all mechanistic . we are mechanism .
if we are machines , then in principle at least , we should be able to build machines out of other stuff , which are just as alive as we are .
but i think for us to admit that , we have to give up on our special-ness , in a certain way .
and we 've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years , at least .
500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun ; 150 years ago , with darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals .
and to imagine -- you know , it 's always hard for us .
recently we 've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn 't even have our own creation event , here on earth , which people didn 't like much . and then the human genome said , maybe we only have 35,000 genes . and that was really -- people didn 't like that , we 've got more genes than that .
we don 't like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures -- i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
but we 're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so .
and the second question is , will the machines want to take over ?
and here the standard scenario is that we create these things , they grow , we nurture them , they learn a lot from us , and then they start to decide that we 're pretty boring , slow .
they want to take over from us .
and for those of you that have teenagers , you know what that 's like .
but hollywood extends it to the robots .
and the question is , you know , will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us ?
and that 's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard , you know -- " i accidentally built a 747 . "
i don 't think that 's going to happen .
and i don 't think -- -- i don 't think we 're going to deliberately build robots that we 're uncomfortable with .
we 'll -- you know , they 're not going to have a super bad robot .
before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot , and before that a not so bad robot .
and we 're just not going to let it go that way .
so , i think i 'm going to leave it at that : the robots are coming , we don 't have too much to worry about , it 's going to be a lot of fun , and i hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / richard _ seymour _ how _ beauty _ feels.html
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .

richard seymour : how beauty feels
when i was little -- and by the way , i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker .
and what this guy had done : he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches .
and one day , one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he 'd bought .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels .
and as he did so , his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving ,
were words .
and he said to the guy , " why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? "
and the watchmaker turned around and said , " god can see it . "
now i 'm not in the least bit religious , neither was my father , but at that point , i noticed something happening here .
i felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves , and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere , i guess .
but i felt something .
and it was a physiological response .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , i began to think of things in a different way .
and as i took on my career as a designer , i began to ask myself the simple question : do we actually think beauty , or do we feel it ?
now you probably know the answer to this already .
you probably think , well , i don 't know which one you think it is , but i think it 's about feeling beauty .
and so i then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things .
one of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
do you remember when lights used to just go on and off , click click , when you closed the door in a car ?
and then somebody , i think it was bmw , introduced a light that went out slowly .
remember that ?
i remember it clearly . do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
i remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
in fact , i 've never found anybody that doesn 't like the light that goes out slowly .
i thought , well what the hell 's that about ?
so i started to ask myself questions about it .
and the first was , i 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
" why ? " and they 'd say , " oh , it feels so natural , "
or , " it 's nice . "
i thought , well that 's not good enough .
can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , i need the vocabulary , i need the keyboard , of how this actually works .
and so i did some experiments .
and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that -- light to dark in six seconds -- exactly that .
do you know what it is ? anyone ?
you see , using this bit , the thinky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that .
and this isn 't a think , it 's a feel .
and would you do me a favor ?
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
i don 't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it .
i felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
and that thing that i found was the cinema or the theater .
it 's actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , " no , the movie 's about to start , " or are you going , " that 's fantastic . i 'm looking forward to it .
i get a sense of anticipation " ?
now i 'm not a neuroscientist .
i don 't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex .
but it might be .
because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this .
and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don 't get it in the same way .
everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
so this leads me to think of this in a different way .
we 're not feeling it . we 're thinking beauty is in the limbic system -- if that 's not an outmoded idea .
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what i 'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking .
the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit , the cortex .
they arrive first .
so how do we make that actually work ?
and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know , or what we 're going to learn , about something ?
this is one of the most beautiful things i know .
it 's a plastic bag .
and when i looked at it first , i thought , no , there 's no beauty in that .
then i found out , post exposure , that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff , that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure , potable drinking water .
and all of a sudden , this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me .
now i 'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit .
would you mind taking the brain out , and i just want you to feel something .
look at that . what are you feeling about it ?
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
i 'm watching your faces very carefully .
there 's some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that .
maybe there 's an innocence to it .
now i 'm going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
this is the last act on this earth of a little girl called heidi , five years old , before she died of cancer to the spine .
it 's the last thing she did , the last physical act .
look at that picture .
look at the innocence . look at the beauty in it .
is it beautiful now ?
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
where are you feeling this ?
i 'm feeling it here . i feel it here .
and i 'm watching your faces , because your faces are telling me something .
the lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
but what are you doing ?
i watch what people do .
i watch faces .
i watch reactions .
because i have to know how people react to things .
and one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty , something stupefyingly delicious , is what i call the omg .
and by the way , there 's no pleasure in that face .
it 's not a " this is wonderful ! "
the eyebrows are doing this , the eyes are defocused , and the mouth is hanging open .
that 's not the expression of joy .
there 's something else in that .
there 's something weird happening .
so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in .
poignancy is a word i love as a designer .
it means something triggering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it 's part of what we do .
it isn 't just about nice .
and this is the dilemma , this is the paradox , of beauty .
sensorily , we 're taking in all sorts of things -- mixtures of things that are good , bad , exciting , frightening -- to come up with that sensorial exposure , that sensation of what 's going on .
pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl 's drawing .
and also triumph , this sense of transcendence , this " i never knew that . ah , this is something new . "
and that 's packed in there as well .
and as we assemble these tools , from a design point of view , i get terribly excited about it , because these are things , as we 've already said , they 're arriving at the brain , it would seem , before cognition , before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .
now what i 'm also interested in is : is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty ?
by that , i mean intrinsically beautiful things , just something that 's exquisitely beautiful , that 's universally beautiful .
very hard to find . maybe you 've got some examples of it .
very hard to find something that , to everybody , is a very beautiful thing , without a certain amount of information packed in there before .
so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic .
it 's mediated by information before the comprehension .
or the information 's added on at the back , like that little girl 's drawing that i showed you .
now when talking about beauty you can 't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
well it obviously isn 't .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
and they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
so it wasn 't about symmetry .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
but they 're both different .
and as a designer , i can 't help meddling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye .
i 'm not getting it off the eyebrow .
and the earhole isn 't doing it to me at all .
so i don 't know how much this is helping me , but it 's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off .
and as i say , i 'm not a neuroscientist , but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements .
anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are , but as we are .
so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and this is the f1 mv agusta .
ahhhh .
it is really -- i mean , i can 't express to you how exquisite this object is .
but i also know why it 's exquisite to me , because it 's a palimpsest of things .
it 's masses and masses of layers .
this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
it 's something much bigger .
layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
i mean , if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects , and that does it consummately well , you can see it can .
so that 's getting me excited .
and i feel that here .
this bit , the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management .
it 's not about the shapes , it 's how the shapes reflect light .
now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it 's standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that 's done on the reflection .
this little relief on the footplate , by the way , to a rider means there 's something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
i 'm getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things .
titanium lacquer on this .
i can 't tell you how wonderful this is . that 's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel .
i 'm really getting into this now .
and of course , a racing bike doesn 't have a prop stand , but this one , because it 's a road bike , it all goes away and it folds into this little gap .
so it disappears .
and then i can 't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator , which is curved . why would you do that ?
because i know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics .
so it 's more expensive , but it 's wonderful .
and to cap it all , brand royalty -- agusta , count agusta , from the great histories of this stuff .
the bit that you can 't see is the genius that created this .
massimo tamburini .
they call him " the plumber " in italy , as well as " maestro , " because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time .
there 's so little compromise on this , you can 't see it .
but unfortunately , the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty .
we have to deal with it .
so i have to work with a supply chain , and i 've got to work with the technologies , and i 've got to work with everything else all the time , and so compromises start to fit into it .
and so look at her .
i 've had to make a bit of a compromise there .
i 've had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
no one 's noticed , have they yet ?
did you see what i did ?
i moved three things by a millimeter .
pretty ? yes .
beautiful ? maybe lesser .
but then , of course , the consumer says that doesn 't really matter .
so that 's okay , isn 't it ?
another millimeter ?
no one 's going to notice those split lines and changes .
it 's that easy to lose beauty ,
because beauty 's incredibly difficult to do .
and only a few people can do it .
and a focus group cannot do it .
and a team rarely can do it .
it takes a central cortex , if you like , to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time .
this is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by ross lovegrove , the designer .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
it 's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious .
i might like it more than you like it , because i know how bloody hard it is to do it .
it 's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that , that comes out of the tool correctly , that goes down the line without falling over .
underneath this , like the story of the swan , is a million things very difficult to do .
so all hail to that .
it 's a fantastic example , a simple object .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
and they 're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
you all , i guess , like me , enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the difficulty .
you also may be taking into account the fact that it 's incredibly painful .
anybody seen a ballet dancer 's toes when they come out of the points ?
while she 's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you , something horrible 's going on down here .
the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on .
now i 'm using microseconds wrongly here , so please ignore me .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i 've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
so we 're going to have a little experiment .
right , are you ready ? i 'm going to show you something for a very , very brief moment .
are you ready ? okay .
did you think that was a bicycle when i showed it to you at the first flash ?
it 's not .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
did you think it was modern ? yes you did .
that blip , that information , shot into you before that .
and because your brain starter motor began there , now it 's got to deal with it .
and the great thing is , this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it 's green technology and it 's good for you and it 's light and it 's all part of the future .
so is that wrong ?
well in this case it isn 't , because it 's a very , very ecologically-sound piece of technology .
but you 're a slave of that first flash .
we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shelf in a shop .
it wins or loses at that point .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but i have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
and finally , the layer that i love , of knowledge .
some of you , i 'm sure , will be familiar with this .
what 's incredible about this , and the way i love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bores you , folding clothes , and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
yeah ?
it 's fantastic , isn 't it ?
look at that . do you want to see it again ?
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can 't do this .
but just go to the web , youtube , pull it down , " folding t-shirt . " that 's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your t-shirt .
you didn 't maybe know it .
but how do you feel about it ?
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing ,
because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?
form follows function ?
only sometimes . only sometimes . form is function . form is function .
it informs , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we 've even thought about it .
and so i 've stopped using words like " form , " and i 've stopped using words like " function " as a designer .
what i try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things . because if i can get that right , i can make them wonderful , and i can make them repeatedly wonderful .
and you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them .
they 're the things that you 'd snatch if the house was on fire .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
thank you very much .

what aspects of religion should atheists adopt ? alain de botton suggests a " religion for atheists " -- call it atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection , ritual and transcendence .
atheism , culture , philosophy , religion

alain de botton : atheism 2.0
one of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don 't -- into the religious and the atheists .
and for the last decade or so , it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means .
there have been some very vocal atheists who 've pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it 's ridiculous .
these people , many of whom have lived in north oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
now i think it 's too easy .
i think it 's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
and it 's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel .
and what i 'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like , a new version of atheism we could call atheism 2.0 .
now what is atheism 2.0 ?
well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there 's no god .
of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
now let 's move on ; that 's not the end of the story , that 's the very , very beginning .
i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , " i can 't believe in any of this stuff .
i can 't believe in the doctrines .
i don 't think these doctrines are right .
but , " a very important but , " i love christmas carols .
i really like the art of mantegna .
i really like looking at old churches .
i really like turning the pages of the old testament . " whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing i 'm talking about -- people who are attracted to the ritualistic side , the moralistic , communal side of religion , but can 't bear the doctrine .
until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart .
so that 's a sort of tough choice .
i don 't think we have to make that choice .
i think there is an alternative .
i think there are ways -- and i 'm being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
if you don 't believe in a religion , there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
and for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as i say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , " what here could we use ? " the secular world is full of holes .
we have secularized badly , i would argue .
and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well .
and i 'd like to run through a few of these today .
i 'd like to kick off by looking at education .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
when we think about how we 're going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that 's where we put a lot of money .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it 's also going to make us better people .
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .
that 's a lovely idea .
interesting where it came from .
in the early 19th century , church attendance in western europe started sliding down very , very sharply , and people panicked .
they asked themselves the following question . they said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
and influential voices came up with one answer .
they said culture .
it 's to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .
let 's look to the plays of shakespeare , the dialogues of plato , the novels of jane austen .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john .
now i think that 's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
and that 's a very plausible idea .
it 's also an idea that we have forgotten .
if you went to a top university -- let 's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said , " i 've come here because i 'm in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; i want to know how to live , " they would show you the way to the insane asylum .
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
they don 't think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
what we need is information .
we need data , we don 't need help .
now religions start from a very different place indeed .
all religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
and like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
we 're only just holding it together .
perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
but anyway , we 're only just holding it together .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
you know , in the 18th century in the u.k. , the greatest preacher , greatest religious preacher , was a man called john wesley , who went up and down this country delivering sermons , advising people how they could live .
he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
now we 've given up with the idea of sermons .
if you said to a modern liberal individualist , " hey , how about a sermon ? " they 'd go , " no , no . i don 't need one of those .
i 'm an independent , individual person . " what 's the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation -- and religions know that .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they 'll remember it .
sit them in a classroom , tell them about plato at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
religions go , " nonsense .
you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
so get on your knees and repeat it . " that 's what all religions tell us : " get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . " otherwise our minds are like sieves .
so religions are cultures of repetition .
they circle the great truths again and again and again .
we associate repetition with boredom .
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
" the new is better than the old . "
if i said to you , " okay , we 're not going to have new ted .
we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true .
we 're going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , " you 'd feel cheated .
not so if you 're adopting a religious mindset .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
all the major religions give us calendars .
what is a calendar ?
a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
in the catholic chronology , catholic calendar , at the end of march you will think about st. jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor .
you won 't do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
now we don 't think that way .
in the secular world we think , " if an idea is important , i 'll bump into it .
i 'll just come across it . " nonsense , says the religious world view .
religious view says we need calendars , we need to structure time , we need to synchronize encounters .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
take the moon . it 's really important to look at the moon .
you know , when you look at the moon , you think , " i 'm really small . what are my problems ? " it sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we don 't .
why don 't we ? well there 's nothing to tell us , " look at the moon . " but if you 're a zen buddhist in the middle of september , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
you 'll be handed rice cakes .
and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart .
that 's very good .
the other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well -- i 'm not doing a very good job of this here -- but oratory , oratory is absolutely key to religions .
in the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
but the religious world doesn 't think that way .
what you 're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
so if you go to an african american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
after every convincing point , people will go , " amen , amen , amen . " at the end of a really rousing paragraph , they 'll all stand up , and they 'll go , " thank you jesus , thank you christ , thank you savior . " if we were doing it like they do it -- let 's not do it , but if we were to do it -- i would tell you something like , " culture should replace scripture . " and you would go , " amen , amen , amen . " and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , " thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . " and we 'd know that we had a real rhythm going .
all right , all right . we 're getting there . we 're getting there .
the other thing that religions know is we 're not just brains , we are also bodies .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
so for example , take the jewish idea of forgiveness .
jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh .
they don 't just deliver us sermons on this .
they don 't just give us books or words about this .
they tell us to have a bath .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
you immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
we don 't tend to do that .
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
let 's look at art now .
now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
a lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals , or our new churches .
you 've heard that saying .
now i think that the potential is there ,
but we 've completely let ourselves down .
and the reason we 've let ourselves down is that we 're not properly studying how religions handle art .
the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art : the first idea is that art should be for art 's sake -- a ridiculous idea -- an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
i couldn 't disagree more .
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn 't explain itself , that artists shouldn 't say what they 're up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
that 's why a very common feeling when you 're in a museum -- let 's admit it -- is , " i don 't know what this is about . " but if we 're serious people , we don 't admit to that .
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
art is about two things in all the major faiths .
firstly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to love .
and secondly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
and that 's what art is .
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
so as you walk around a church , or a mosque or a cathedral , what you 're trying to imbibe , what you 're imbibing is , through your eyes , through your senses , truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
essentially it 's propaganda .
rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view .
now the word " propaganda " sets off alarm bells .
we think of hitler , we think of stalin . don 't , necessarily .
propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
and if that thing is good , there 's no problem with it at all .
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if i was a museum curator , i would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
all works of art are talking to us about things .
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we 've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
art should be didactic .
let 's think of something else .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
and they tend to be on their own .
they 're our cottage industries . they are vulnerable , single people .
and they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
and they don 't really change much .
now think about religions , think about organized religions .
what do organized religions do ?
they group together , they form institutions .
and that has all sorts of advantages .
first of all , scale , might .
the catholic church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal .
these are massive machines .
they 're collaborative , they 're branded , they 're multinational , and they 're highly disciplined .
these are all very good qualities .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
and corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they 're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it .
books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
we need to group together .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and that 's what religions do .
they are multinational , as i say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they don 't get lost in a busy world .
that 's something we can learn from .
i want to conclude .
really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don 't believe any of it .
if you 're involved in anything that 's communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
if you 're involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
look very closely at pilgrimage .
we haven 't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven 't looked at what religions do with travel .
if you 're in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
and if you 're an educator in any way , again , look at how religions are spreading ideas .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
so really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religions are so subtle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they 're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone ; they 're for all of us .
thank you very much .
chris anderson : now this is actually a courageous talk , because you 're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
ab : you can get shot by both sides .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
ca : incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment .
ab : indeed .
ca : but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense -- that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious -- of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
ab : absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , " but isn 't there something bigger than us , something else ? " and i say , " of course . " and they say , " so aren 't you sort of religious ? " and i go , " no . " why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling ?
science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so i don 't feel the need .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
so one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
ca : actually , let me just ask a question .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
is there an equivalent process by which there 's a sort of bridge between what you 're talking about and what you would say to them ?
ab : i would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
it 's not as though , as i try to suggest , it 's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don 't have religion and then you 're cut off from all these very good things .
it 's so sad that we constantly say , " i don 't believe so i can 't have community , so i 'm cut off from morality , so i can 't go on a pilgrimage . " one wants to say , " nonsense . why not ? " and that 's really the spirit of my talk .
there 's so much we can absorb .
atheism shouldn 't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
ca : it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
but probably most people in the community certainly don 't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
ab : no , we need to be polite about differences .
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
it 's seen as hypocrisy .
but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says , " well you know , i did pray the other day , " you politely ignore it .
you move on .
because you 've agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
and i think that 's what the religious wars of late have ignored .
they 've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
ca : and finally , does this new thing that you 're proposing that 's not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunteering to be the pope ?
ab : well , one thing that we 're all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
it doesn 't need it .
what i 've tried to lay out is a framework and i 'm hoping that people can just fill it in .
i 've sketched a sort of broad framework .
but wherever you are , as i say , if you 're in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
if you 're in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
so it 's a wiki project .
ca : alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .

anil ananthaswamy : what it takes to do extreme astrophysics
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon , which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it .
my own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather accidentally .
i had bought a copy of this book , " the universe and dr. einstein " -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle .
a few years after that , in bangalore , i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night , and i picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
and as it happened , i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
and that feeling hasn 't left me yet .
that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that i could partake in the joy of science , and also the joy of communicating it to others .
and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes , detectors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
and today i would like to share with you some images , some stories of these trips .
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe .
and i first begin with a pie chart -- and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation --
but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we 're all made of -- and that 's four percent of the universe .
astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which permeates the fabric of space-time , that makes up another 73 percent .
so if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our exploration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
and most of the experiments , telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy .
i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors .
and the reason why they have to go underground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth , the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays , ambient radio activity , even our own bodies . you might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment .
so they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector .
and i went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it 's entirely dark in there --
this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960 .
and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
and the miners in the early part of the last century worked , literally , in candlelight .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
and , among other things , they 're looking for dark matter .
there is another way to search for dark matter , which is indirectly .
if dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos .
and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules .
when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light , a flash of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then , indirectly , something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .
but you need very , very large volumes of water in order to do this .
you need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino .
and where in the world would you find such water ?
well the russians have a tank in their own backyard .
this is lake baikal .
it is the largest lake in the world . it 's 800 km long .
it 's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
and what the russians are doing is they 're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light .
and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there .
this is lake baikal in the peak of the siberian winter .
the lake is entirely frozen .
and the line of black dots that you see in the background , that 's the ice camp where the physicists are working .
the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don 't have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and submersibles to do their work .
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter .
they have to drill holes in the ice , dive down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice melts .
because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it 's full of cracks .
and you have to imagine , there 's an entire sea-like lake underneath , moving .
i still don 't understand this one russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working .
and these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist . and they have dedicated their lives to it .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
it 's very harsh conditions .
they work on a shoestring budget .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack .
and it 's that basic , but they do this every year .
from siberia to the atacama desert in chile , to see something called the very large telescope .
the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively .
i can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they 're planning is called the extremely large telescope .
and you wouldn 't believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
but nonetheless , it 's an extraordinary piece of engineering .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
and these telescopes , among other things , they 're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror . each mirror , there are four of them , is made of a single piece of glass , a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic , that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [ to ] imagine a city like paris , with all its buildings and the eiffel tower ,
if you grind down paris to that kind of accuracy , you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high .
and that 's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
here 's another view of the same .
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .
the dry air is really good for telescopes , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies .
finally , i want to take you to antarctica .
i want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
this is cosmology 's final frontier .
some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in antarctica .
i was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight , which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere , the upper stratosphere , 40 km up .
and that 's where they do their experiments , and then the balloon , the payload , is brought down .
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica .
that 's an american c-17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica .
and here we are about to board our bus .
and i don 't know if you can read the lettering , but it says , " ivan the terribus . "
and that 's taking us to mcmurdo .
and this is the scene that greets you in mcmurdo .
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
because it 's so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
it 's an extraordinary place .
this is mcmurdo itself . about a thousand people work here in summer , and about 200 in winter when it 's completely dark for six months .
i was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km .
what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
and the engineers , the technicians , the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf , because antarctica -- i won 't go into the reasons why -- but it 's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches , except for the weather .
the weather , as you can imagine ,
this is summer , and you 're standing on 200 ft of ice .
and there 's a volcano behind , which has glaciers at the very top .
and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric , parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium .
and that process takes about two hours .
and the weather can change as they 're putting together this whole assembly .
for instance , here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with helium .
those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium .
now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mcmurdo station .
and this particular balloon , because it has to launch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge balloon .
the fabric alone weighs two tons .
in order to minimize the weight , it 's very thin , it 's as thin as a sandwich wrapper .
and if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in texas .
here , they can 't do it with the kind shoes they 're wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get barefoot into the boxes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
that 's the kind of dedication these people have .
here 's the balloon being filled up with helium , and you can see it 's a gorgeous sight .
here 's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end .
so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side , and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there 's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute , and then the parachute is then connected to the payload .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
they 're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
and i would like to share with you a launch .
radio : okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
anil ananthaswamy : and i 'll finally like to leave you with two images .
this is an observatory in the himalayas , in ladakh in india .
and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side .
and on the far left there is a 400 year-old buddhist monastery .
this is a close-up of the buddhist monastery .
and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
one is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being .
and both require silence of some sort .
and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes , the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it 's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
and it was very obvious that , if we destroy these silent places on earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space .
thank you .

brewster kahle builds a free digital library
we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
if we don 't do that , we 're going to get the generation we deserve .
they 're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .
and we , as now the elite , parents , librarians , professionals , whatever it is , a bunch of our activities are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as broadly as we can .
i 'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone .
one is what 's on the boston public library .
carved above their door is , " free to all . " it 's kind of an inspiring statement , and i 'll go back at the end of this .
i 'm a librarian , and what i 'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
and the idea of using technology is perfect for us .
i think we have the opportunity to one-up the greeks .
it 's not easy to one-up the greeks . but with the industriousness of the egyptians , they were able to build the library of alexandria -- the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world .
the problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it .
on the other hand , if you did , then great things happened .
i think we can one-up the greeks and achieve something .
and i 'm going to try to argue only one point today : that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp .
so if i 'm successful , then you 'll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that 's ever wanted to have access to it .
yes , there 's issues about how money should be distributed , and that 's still being refigured out .
but i 'd say there 's plenty of money , and there 's plenty of demand , so we can actually achieve that .
but i 'm going to go over the technological , social and sort of where are we as a whole , trying to get to that particular vision .
and the way i 'm going to try to do this is do it like the amazon.com website , the books , music , video and just go step -- media type by media type , just go and say , all right , how 're we doing on this ?
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . how big is it ?
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
well , we don 't really know , but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress . it 's 26 million volumes , 26 million volumes .
it is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
and a book , if you had a book , is about a megabyte , so -- you know , if you had it in microsoft word .
so a megabyte , 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes -- it goes mega- , giga- , tera- . 26 terabytes .
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that 's about this big , on spinning linux drives , and it costs about 60,000 dollars .
so for the cost of a house -- or around here , a garage -- you can put , you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress .
that 's pretty neat .
then the question is , what do you get ?
you know , is it worth trying to get there ?
do you actually want it online ?
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that 's kind of fun .
and you can download these things , and look around them in new and different ways .
and you can get at them remotely , if you happen to have a laptop .
there 's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways , and you can search them , make little tabs , and it 's kind of cute -- still very book-like -- on your laptop .
but i don 't know , reading things on a laptop -- whenever i pull up my laptop , it always feels like work .
i think that 's one of the reasons why the kindle is so great .
i don 't have to feel like i 'm at work to read a kindle . it 's starting to be a little bit more specified .
but i have to say that there 's older technologies that i tend to like .
i like the physical book .
and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
and we sort of said , well , how hard is this ?
and it turns out to not be very hard .
we actually went off to make a bookmobile .
and a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , binder and cutter , and kids make their own books .
it costs about three dollars to download , print and bind a normal , old book .
and they actually come out kind of nice looking .
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
so the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again .
there are some other bookmobiles running around .
this is eric eldred making books at walden pond -- thoreau 's works .
this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services , for competing with the bookstore there .
in india , they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria , the new library of alexandria , in egypt .
it was quite popularly attended .
and kids starting to make their own books ,
and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever owned .
so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro , but i think it still has its place .
and being from the silicon valley , sort of utopian sort of world , we thought , if we can make this technology work in rural uganda , we might have something .
so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out .
and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from silicon valley , fly them to uganda , buy a car , set up the first internet connection at the national library of uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in rural uganda .
and it actually -- so technologically , it works .
what we found out of this is we didn 't have the right books .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they 're digitized , but we didn 't know how to quite get them digitized .
everybody thought the answer is , send things to india and china .
and so we 've tried that , and i 'll go over that in a moment .
there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
one is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine .
we have one of these things now . it 's completely cool .
it 's all conveyor belt , and it makes a book .
and it 's called the " espresso book machine , " and in about 10 minutes , you can press a button and make a book .
something else i 'm quite excited about in this particular domain , beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little screens that are coming out .
and one of my favorites in this is the $ 100 laptop .
and i don 't mean to steal any thunder here , but we 've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader .
so here 's one of the beta units and you can -- it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader .
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good .
at 200 dots per inch , it 's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer .
we 're in good enough shape .
you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily .
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
so we thought , okay , well , let 's try out this send books to india thing .
and there was a project with , funded by the national science foundation -- sent a bunch of scanners , and the american libraries were supposed to send books .
well , they didn 't . they didn 't want to send their books .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to india .
and then we learned why you don 't want to send books to india .
the lesson we learned out of this is , scan your own books .
if you really care about books , you 're going to scan them better , especially if they 're valuable books .
if they 're new books and you can just , you know , butcher them , because you could just buy another one , that 's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning .
but do things that you love .
but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books -- about 300,000 now -- doing very well .
the chinese did over a million , and the egyptians are about 30,000 .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we 're going to need to do this , let 's do it in-library .
how do we go and do this , and how do we get it down so that it 's a cost point that we could afford ?
and we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page .
if it 's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize , ocr , package it up , make it so that you could download , print and bind it -- the whole shebang -- we would have achieved something .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto-page-turning things .
if we can have mars rovers , you 'd think you could turn pages .
but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volume isn 't there .
so anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner ,
and with two digital , high-grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum lighting , so even if it 's a black and white book , you can go and get the proper intonation .
so you basically do a beautiful , respectful job .
this is not a fax , this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you 're going through these libraries .
and we 've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
this is what it looks like at the university of toronto .
and actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage .
people seem to love it .
yes , it 's a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
and especially if it 's kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read . we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this , at getting 10 cents a page .
so 10 cents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book .
the library of congress , if you did the whole darn thing -- 26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars , right ?
but a million books , i think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . that 's not that big a bill .
and what we 've been able to do is get into libraries .
we 've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries , and libraries are up for having their books scanned . the getty here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out-of-copyright books , which is fabulous .
so we 're starting to get the institutional responsibility .
the thing we 're missing is the 10 cents .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
we 've scanned about 200,000 books .
now we 're scanning about 15,000 books a month ,
and it 's starting to gear up another factor of two from there .
so all in all , that 's going very well .
and we 're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world .
so i think of -- we 're kind of going from the out-of-copyright , library stuff , and amazon.com is coming from the in-print world . and i think we 'll meet in the middle some place , and have the classic thing that you have , which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .
and so we 're starting up a program to do out-of-print works , but loaning them .
exactly what loaning means , i 'm not quite sure .
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over .
so all in all , it 's possible to do this in large scale .
we 're also going back over microfilm and getting that online .
so , we can do 10 cents a page , we 're going 15,000 books a month and we 've got about 250,000 books online , counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .
so what i wanted to argue is , books are within our grasp .
the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal .
yes , it costs tens of millions , low hundreds of millions , but one time shot and we 've got basically the history of printed literature online .
and then , there 's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
but it is within our grasp , technologically and law-wise , at least for the out of print and out of copyright , we suggest , to be able to get the whole darn thing online .
now let 's go for audio , and i 'm going to go through these .
so how much is there ?
well , as best we can tell , there are about two to three million disks having been published -- so 78s , long-playing records and cds -- or at least that 's the largest archives of published materials we 've been able to sort of point at .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online , if you 're doing things in volume .
but we 've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny .
this is a fairly heavily litigated area , so we 've found that there are niches in the music world that aren 't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system .
and we 've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net .
in the united states , it doesn 't cost you to give something away . right ?
if you give something to a charity or to the public , you get a pat on the back and a tax donation -- except on the net , where you can go broke .
if you put up a video of your garage band , and it starts getting heavily accessed , you can lose your guitars or your house .
this doesn 't make any sense .
so we 've offered unlimited storage , unlimited bandwidth , forever , for free , to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library .
and we 've been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock ' n ' rollers .
the rock ' n ' rollers had a tradition of sharing , as long as nobody made any money . you could -- concert recordings , it 's not the commercial recordings , but concert recordings , started by the grateful dead .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day .
we have about 40,000 concerts , everything the grateful dead ever did , up on the net , so that people can see it and listen to this material .
so audio is possible to put up , but the rights issues are really pretty thorny .
we 've got a lot of collections now -- a couple hundred thousand items -- and it 's growing over time .
moving images : if you think of theatrical releases , there are not that many of them .
as best we can tell , there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution . it 's just not that many .
but half of those were indian .
but anyway , it 's doable , but we 've only found about a thousand of these things that -- to be out of copyright .
so we 've digitized those and made those available .
but we 've found that there 's lots of other types of movies that haven 't really seen the light of day -- archival films .
we 've found , also , a lot of political films , a lot of amateur films , all sorts of things that are basically needing a home , a permanent home .
so we 've been starting to make these available and it 's grown to be very popular .
we 're not quite a youtube . we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
television comes quite a bit larger .
we started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day .
it 's sort of the biggest tivo box you 've ever seen .
it 's about a petabyte , so far , of worldwide television -- russian , chinese , japanese , iraqi , al jazeera , bbc , cnn , abc , cbs , nbc -- 24 hours a day .
we only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9 / 11 , sort of from 9 / 11 / 2001 . for one week , what did the world see ?
cnn was saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets .
were they ? let 's look at the palestinian television and find out .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote
and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
and television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable , except by jon stewart , who does a fabulous job .
so anyway , television is , i would suggest , within our grasp .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we 're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
and we 've got , now , a lot of these materials .
so we 've got about 100,000 pieces up there .
so books , music , video , software . there 's only 50,000 titles of it .
mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections .
but we 've worked through some of those , but we 've still got real problems in washington .
well , we 're best known as the world wide web .
we 've been archiving the world wide web since 1996 .
we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it , every two months .
and actually , it 's really been pioneered by alexa internet , which donates this collection to the internet archive .
and it 's been growing along for the last 11 years , and it 's a fantastic resource .
and we 've made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
if you go and search on something -- this is google.com , the different versions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release , and this is what it looked like at stanford .
so anyway , you 've got basically an idea of where things came from .
mostly , people want to see their old stuff out of this .
if there 's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one , which is probably best known for burning , is , don 't just have one copy .
so we 've started to -- we 've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alexandria .
so this is a picture of the internet archive at the library of alexandria .
and we now have also another copy building up in amsterdam .
so , we should put it in the san andreas fault line in san francisco , flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east . right , so anyway ...
so we 're hedging our bets here .
if we go and put it in a couple more places , i think we 'll be in good shape .
there 's a political and social question out of this .
is all of this , as we go digital , is it going to be public or private ?
there 's some large companies that have seen this vision , that are doing large-scale digitization , but they 're locking up the public domain .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
what 's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ?
how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future , just as we basically benefited as we were growing up ?
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .
it could be something that we 're remembered for , for millennia , for having achieved .
and as i said before , i 'll end with something that 's carved above the door of the carnegie library . carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country -- carved above his legacy , " free to the people . "
thank you very much .

imagine , if you will -- a gift .
i 'd like for you to picture it in your mind .
it 's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball .
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
but before i show you what 's inside , i will tell you , it 's going to do incredible things for you .
it will bring all of your family together .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven 't heard from in years .
adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
it will recalibrate what 's most important in your life .
it will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
you 'll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
you 'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
you 'll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you 'll have a healthier lifestyle .
and get this -- you 'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
you 'll eat countless gourmet meals .
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
people will say to you , " you look great . have you had any work done ? "
and you 'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
you 'll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
your life will have new meaning .
peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
the price ?
$ 55,000 ,
and that 's an incredible deal .
by now i know you 're dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
does amazon carry it ?
does it have the apple logo on it ?
is there a waiting list ?
not likely .
this gift came to me about five months ago .
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
and this ,
and then this .
it was a rare gem -- a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving .
and while i 'm okay now , i wouldn 't wish this gift for you .
i 'm not sure you 'd want it .
but i wouldn 't change my experience .
it profoundly altered my life in ways i didn 't expect in all the ways i just shared with you .
so the next time you 're faced with something that 's unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .

paul stamets on 6 ways mushrooms can save the world
i love a challenge , and saving the earth is probably a good one .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
we have now entered in the 6x , the sixth major extinction on this planet .
i often wondered , if there was a united organization of organisms -- otherwise known as " uh-oh " -- -- and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ?
i think that vote is occurring right now .
i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium .
the mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it 's extremely tenacious .
this holds up to 30,000 times its mass .
they 're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians .
they generate the humus soils across the landmasses of earth .
we have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants , mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks , cedars and douglas firs .
dusty and i , we like to say , on sunday , this is where we go to church .
i 'm in love with the old-growth forest , and i 'm a patriotic american because we have those .
most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms .
and frankly , i face a big obstacle . when i mention mushrooms to somebody , they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms , their eyes glaze over , and they think i 'm a little crazy .
so , i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
we call it mycophobia , the irrational fear of the unknown , when it comes to fungi .
mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
mushrooms produce strong antibiotics .
in fact , we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom .
a group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta -- a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together .
we share in common the same pathogens .
fungi don 't like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
but here is a mushroom that 's past its prime .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
and so we see a mushroom here sporulating .
and the spores are germinating , and the mycelium forms and goes underground .
in a single cubic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells .
my foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
this is photomicrographs from nick read and patrick hickey .
and notice that as the mycelium grows , it conquers territory and then it begins the net .
i 've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , i have thousands of electron micrographs , and when i 'm staring at the mycelium , i realize that they are microfiltration membranes .
we exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
it inhales oxygen , just like we do .
but these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
and i present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes .
and in these cavities , these micro-cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
these are little wells .
and inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion , but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms .
i first proposed , in the early 1990s , that mycelium is earth 's natural internet .
when you look at the mycelium , they 're highly branched .
and if there 's one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the nodes of crossing -- internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information .
the mycelium is sentient .
it knows that you are there .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
so , i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven , biologically successful model .
the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organism on this planet , are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere .
going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype .
i believe matter begets life ; life becomes single cells ; single cells become strings ; strings become chains ; chains network .
and this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land .
they came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
how is that possible ?
it 's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids , and many other acids and enzymes , pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates .
makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together .
so , fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates .
and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
this was first discovered in 1859 .
this is a photograph by franz hueber .
this photograph 's taken 1950s in saudi arabia .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
it was called prototaxites .
prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .
dr. boyce , at the university of chicago , published an article in the journal of geology this past year determining that prototaxites was a giant fungus , a giant mushroom .
across the landscapes of earth were dotted these giant mushrooms .
all across most land masses .
and these existed for tens of millions of years .
now , we 've had several extinction events , and as we march forward -- 65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact .
the earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .
sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the earth .
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
more recently , at einstein university , they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy , much like plants use light .
so , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , i think , is a forgone conclusion , at least in my own mind .
the largest organism in the world is in eastern oregon .
i couldn 't miss it . it was 2,200 acres in size :
2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat , one cell wall thick .
how is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
the mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom -- it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt .
we were involved with several experiments .
i 'm going to show you six , if i can , solutions for helping to save the world .
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham , washington .
there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste :
one was a control pile ; one pile was treated with enzymes ; one pile was treated with bacteria ; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .
the mycelium absorbs the oil .
the mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .
these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
so , the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil , and then , when we returned six weeks later , all the tarps were removed , all the other piles were dead , dark and stinky .
we came back to our pile , it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms , and the color changed to a light form .
the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
they 're very large .
they 're showing how much nutrition that they could 've obtained .
but something else happened , which was an epiphany in my life .
they sporulated , the spores attract insects , the insects laid eggs , eggs became larvae .
birds then came , bringing in seeds , and our pile became an oasis of life .
whereas the other three piles were dead , dark and stinky , and the pah 's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons -- went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
the last image we don 't have . the entire pile was a green berm of life .
these are gateway species ,
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities .
so i invented burlap sacks , bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris , you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that 's producing e. coli , or other wastes , or a factory with chemical toxins , and it leads to habitat restoration .
so , we set up a site in mason county , washington , and we 've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms .
and i 'll show you a graph here .
this is a logarithmic scale , 10 to the eighth power .
there 's more than a 100 million colonies per gram , and 10 to the third power is around 1,000 .
in 48 hours to 72 hours , these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times .
think of the implications .
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .
so , this one mushroom , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
this is my wife dusty , with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis -- agarikon .
it 's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that dioscorides first described in 65 a.d .
as a treatment against consumption .
this mushroom grows in washington state , oregon , northern california , british columbia , now thought to be extinct in europe .
may not seem that large -- let 's get closer .
this is extremely rare fungus .
our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out -- we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year .
we found one sample to be able to get into culture .
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .
i 've been involved with the u.s. defense department bioshield program .
we submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water , and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites .
and a few years ago , we received these results .
we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses .
dr. earl kern , who 's a smallpox expert of the u.s. defense department , states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
our mushroom strains were in the highly active range .
there 's a vetted press release that you can read -- it 's vetted by dod -- if you google " stamets " and " smallpox . " or you can go to npr.org and listen to a live interview .
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
and so , for the first time , i am showing this .
we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses .
here 's the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
we tried it against flu a viruses -- h1n1 , h3n2 -- as well as flu b viruses .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense .
i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects .
our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
so , i went to the epa homepage , and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants , as well as termites .
i did something that nobody else had done .
i actually chased the mycelium , when it stopped producing spores .
these are spores -- this is in their spores .
i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
and so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
but the insects aren 't stupid , and they would avoid the spores when they came close , and so i morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form .
and i got my daughter 's barbie doll dish , i put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the mycelium , because there 's no spores .
they gave it to the queen .
one week later , i had no sawdust piles whatsoever .
and then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death -- the mycelium is consumed by the ants , they become mummified , and , boing , a mushroom pops out of their head .
now after sporulation , the spores repel .
so , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
so , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
and so my house came down , i received my first patent against carpenter ants , termites and fire ants .
then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
this has huge implications .
i then received my second patent -- and this is a big one .
it 's been called an alexander graham bell patent . it covers over 200,000 species .
this is the most disruptive technology -- i 've been told by executives of the pesticide industry -- that they have ever witnessed .
this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world .
you could fly 100 ph.d. students under the umbrella of this concept , because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi , prior to sporulation , attract the very insects
that are otherwise repelled by those spores .
and so i came up with a life box , because i needed a delivery system .
the life box -- you 're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium . and then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
i want to reinvent the delivery system , and the use of cardboard around the world , so they become ecological footprints .
if there 's a youtube-like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zip code specific -- where people could join together , and through satellite imaging systems , through virtual earth or google earth , you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered
by the trees that are coming through life boxes .
you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes , you could add water -- i developed this for the refugee community -- corns , beans and squash and onions .
i took several containers -- my wife said , if i could do this , anybody could -- and i ended up growing a seed garden . then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you , eric rasmussen , for your help on this -- and then you 're harvesting the seed garden .
then you can harvest the kernels , and then you just need a few kernels . i add mycelium to it , and then i inoculate the corncobs .
now , three corncobs , no other grain -- lots of mushrooms begin to form . too many withdrawals from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
but watch what happens here .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
and so i thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
and we came up with econol .
generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary -- and you gain all the benefits that i 've described to you already .
but to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent , and i think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels .
so , we build the carbon banks on the planet , renew the soils . these are a species that we need to join with .
i think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
thank you very much .

jane poynter : life in biosphere 2
i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres .
of course we all here in this room live in biosphere 1 .
i 've also lived in biosphere 2 .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres . and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
so what did i learn ? well , here i am inside biosphere 2 , making a pizza .
so i am harvesting the wheat , in order to make the dough .
and then of course i have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese .
it took me four months in biosphere 2 to make a pizza .
here in biosphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes ,
because i pick up the phone and i call and say , " hey , can you deliver the pizza ? "
so biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre , entirely sealed , miniature world that i lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
over the top it was sealed with steel and glass ,
underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --
essentially entirely sealed .
so we had our own miniature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef .
we had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
we had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything .
and of course we had our human habitat , where we lived .
back in the mid- ' 80s when we were designing biosphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
i mean , what is a biosphere ?
back then , yes , i guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth , right ?
well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one .
and so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is , nothing goes in or out at all , no material -- and energetically open ,
which is essentially what planet earth is .
this is a chamber that was 1 / 400th the size of biosphere 2 that we called our test module .
and the very first day that this fellow , john allen , walked in , to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we 'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive , the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin , or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something , fungus .
but of course none of that happened .
and over the ensuing few years , there were great sagas about designing biosphere 2 .
but by 1991 we finally had this thing built .
and it was time for us to go in and give it a go .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
can you take this biosphere , that has evolved on a planetary scale , and jam it into a little bottle , and will it survive ?
big questions .
and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to mars , for instance , would we take a biosphere with us , to live in it ? we also wanted to know so we can understand more about the earth that we all live in .
well , in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .
let 's take it on a maiden voyage .
will it work ? or will something happen that we can 't understand and we can 't fix ,
thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres ?
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
more on that later .
and this is the world that we lived in .
so , on the top , we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean ,
and underneath we had all this technosphere , we called it ,
which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers , and all of that .
one of the biospherians called it " garden of eden on top of an aircraft carrier . "
and then also we had the human habitat of course , with the laboratories , and all of that .
this is the agriculture .
it was essentially an organic farm .
the day i walked into biosphere 2 , i was , for the first time , breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world , except seven other people .
at that moment i became part of that biosphere .
and i don 't mean that in an abstract sense ;
i mean it rather literally .
when i breathed out , my co2 fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing .
and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes .
and those sweet potatoes became part of me .
in fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato .
i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn 't that much of a joke over the long term ,
because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
and we knew that we were losing co2 .
and so we were working to sequester carbon .
good lord -- we know that term now .
we were growing plants like crazy .
we were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
we stopped irrigating our soil , as much as we could .
we stopped tilling , so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air .
but our oxygen was going down faster than our co2 was going up , which was quite unexpected ,
because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module .
and it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek .
we had lost seven tons of oxygen .
and we had no clue where it was .
and i tell you , when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far ; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness , do you feel dreadful .
i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere .
and we had sleep apnea at night .
so you 'd wake up gasping with breath , because your blood chemistry has changed .
and that you literally do that . you stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up . and it 's very irritating .
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
i mean , the media was making it sound like were were dying .
and i had to call up my mother every other day saying , " no , mum , it 's fine , fine .
we 're not dead . we 're fine . we 're fine . " and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
and one day he couldn 't add up a line of figures .
and it was time for us to put oxygen in .
and you might think , well , " boy , your life support system was failing you . wasn 't that dreadful ? " yes . in a sense it was terrifying .
except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time , if it really got bad ,
though who was going to say , " i can 't take it anymore ! " ?
not me , that was for sure .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project ,
because we could really crank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
and we did indeed find it .
and we found it in the concrete .
essentially it had done something very simple .
we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost .
it broke down ; it took oxygen out of the air ;
it put co2 into the air ; and it went into the concrete .
pretty straightforward really .
so at the end of the two years when we came out , we were elated ,
because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite " uhh , " when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that 's a very bad failure .
except that we knew what it was . and we knew how to fix it .
and nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that .
and we proved the concept , more or less .
people , on the other hand , was a different subject .
we were -- yeah i don 't know that we were fixable .
we all went quite nuts , i will say .
and the day i came out of biosphere 2 , i was thrilled i was going to see all my family and my friends .
for two years i 'd been seeing people through the glass .
and everybody ran up to me .
and i recoiled . they stank !
people stink !
we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff .
now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean ,
but nothing with perfume .
and boy do we stink out here .
not only that , but i lost touch of where my food came from .
i had been growing all my own food .
i had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
i didn 't even recognize half the names in most of the food that i was eating .
in fact , i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops , reading all the names on all of the things .
people must have thought i was nuts .
it was really quite astonishing .
and i slowly lost track of where i was in this big biosphere , in this big biosphere that we all live in .
in biosphere 2 i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very viscerally , very literally .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
and one of the things we did was try to figure out : how small can you make these biospheres ,
and what can you do with them ?
and so we sent one onto the mir space station .
we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station , for 16 months , where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space --
really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are .
and i 'm also proud to announce that you 're getting a sneak preview -- on friday we 're going to announce that we 're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon ,
which is going to be pretty fun .
and the legacy of that is a system that we were designing : an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on mars .
and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of co2 and oxygen and water through this plant system .
as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places , in eritrea , in the horn of africa .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
it is so dry .
this is what i saw .
but this is also what i saw .
i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it .
and it will produce a food crop .
in this case it was oilseed .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and whatnot , like we had in the biosphere .
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms .
shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth , frankly , from an environmental point of view .
they pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean .
they also pollute their next-door neighbors .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people .
they had created an industrial ecosystem , of a sense .
i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the u.n. kyoto protocol system .
and as i was modeling this mangrove swamp , i was thinking to myself , " how do you put a box around this ? " when i 'm modeling a plant in a box , literally , i know where to draw the boundary .
in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea .
well , of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the earth .
and understand its interactions with the entire earth .
and put your project in that context .
around the world today we 're seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon . and here the light green are areas of massive deforestation .
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
we 're in the process of transforming from this , to what i would call a biophilic society , one where we learn to nurture society .
now it may not seem like it , but we are .
it is happening all across the world , in every kind of walk of life , and every kind of career and industry that you can think of .
and i think often times people get lost in that .
they go , " but how can i possibly find my way in that ?
it 's such a huge subject . " and i would say that the small stuff counts . it really does .
this is the story of a rake in my backyard .
this was my backyard , very early on , when i bought my property .
and in arizona , of course , everybody puts gravel down .
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and i want to throttle them .
it 's a certain type of aesthetic .
we 're very uncomfortable with untidiness .
and i threw away my rake .
and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property .
and over time , essentially what have i been doing ?
i 've been building topsoil .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
and i have an oasis .
this is what happens every spring . for six weeks , six to eight weeks , i have this flush of green oasis .
this is actually in a riparian area .
and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake .
the small stuff counts .
the industrial revolution -- and prometheus -- has given us this , the ability to light up the world .
it has also given us this , the ability to look at the world from the outside .
now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to , and compare it to this biosphere .
but we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to interact with it .
and if you lose where you are in your biosphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the yogis had it right .
breath does , in fact , connect us all
in a very literal way .
take a breath now .
and as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
there perhaps is the co2 from the person sitting next-door to you .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
it also connects us in time .
there may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs .
there could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren .
thank you .

dennis vanengelsdorp : a plea for bees
what i 'd like you to do is , just really quickly , is just , sort of , nod to the person on your right , and then nod to the person on your left .
now , chances are that over the last winter , if you had been a beehive , either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died .
now , that 's an awful lot of bees .
and this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the colonies , or we estimate we 've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter .
now , that 's a lot , a lot of bees , and that 's really important .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
we know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses , and we also have this new phenomenon , which i talked about last year , colony collapse disorder .
and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december .
and below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until february , and then they 're shipped out to the almonds .
and one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after i was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
now , i 'm going to sum up a year 's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
and what we know is that it 's as if the bees have caught a flu .
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
in some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called israeli acute paralysis virus .
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it , and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease , because , of course , there 's the implication .
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
it 's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus , and so the question we 're still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu , and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases ?
and we don 't have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out .
we think perhaps it 's a combination of factors .
we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that , you know , we 're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive , and surprisingly , sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides . and so we discover all these very strange things that we can 't begin to understand .
and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
now of course , if you lose a lot of colonies , beekeepers can replace them very quickly .
and that 's why we 've been able to recover from a lot of loss .
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out .
but what beekeepers can do is , if they have one surviving colony , they can split that colony in two .
and then the one half that doesn 't have a queen , they can buy a queen .
it comes in the mail ; it can come from australia or hawaii or florida , and you can introduce that queen .
and in fact , america was the first country that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact , it 's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
if you don 't just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they 've been able to cover those losses .
so even though we 've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
now , those losses are tragic on many fronts , and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper .
and it 's really important to talk about beekeepers first , because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you 'll ever meet .
if this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying nra member who 's , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer .
and you get all of these people in the same room , and they 're all engaged and they 're getting along , and they 're all there because of the passion for bees .
now , there 's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers , the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone .
and these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet .
they 're just fascinating . and they 're like that all over the world .
i had the privilege of working in haiti just for two weeks earlier this year .
and haiti , if you 've ever been there , is just a tragedy .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
but you meet this beekeeper , and i met this beekeeper here , and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers i 've ever met .
no formal education , but very knowledgeable .
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . and so that ingenuity is inspiring .
we also have dave hackenberg , who is the poster child of ccd .
he 's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
and he has a history of these trucks , and he 's moved these bees up and down the coast .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we 've done that for thousands of years .
the ancient egyptians used to move bees up and down the nile on rafts , so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all .
and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies .
and you can do that one year in a row , you may be able to do it two years in a row .
but if you 're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can 't survive three years in a row . and we 're really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
and that 's important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that 's in agriculture .
and these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of america .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
and if you look at florida , in dade city , florida , that 's where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go .
and then 20 miles down the road is groveland , and that 's where all the wisconsin beekeepers go .
and if you 're ever in central valley in february , you go to this cafe at 10 o 'clock in the morning , kathy and kate 's .
and that 's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves .
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it 's a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that 's quite essential american experience .
and we see these families , these nomadic families , you know , father to son , father to son , and these guys are hurting .
and they 're not people who like to ask for help , although they are the most helpful people ever .
if there 's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul , everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives to help him replace those lost colonies .
and so , it 's a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
and although i highly encourage you , all use honey .
i mean , it 's the most ethical sweetener , and you know , it 's a dynamic and fun sweetener .
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees .
now , i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice , some fruits , some granola , i should have had whole wheat bread , i realized , but you know , jam on my wonderbread , and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients , -- except for the almonds i wasn 't going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated , we wouldn 't have much on our plate .
so if we did not have bees , it 's not like we would starve , but clearly our diet would be diminished .
it 's said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
and that 's a really great expression , because really , bees are the sex workers for flowers . they are , you know -- they get paid for their services .
they get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower . and there are flowers that are self-infertile . that means they can 't -- the pollen in their bloom can 't fertilize themselves .
so in an apple orchard , for instance , you 'll have rows of 10 apples of one variety , and then you have another apple tree that 's a different type of pollen .
and bees are very faithful .
when they 're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
and of course , they 're made to carry this pollen .
they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom .
however , honeybees are a minority .
honeybees are not native to america ; they were introduced with the colonialists .
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined .
in pennsylvania alone , we have been surveying bees for 150 years , and very intensely in the last three years .
we have identified over 400 species of bees in pennsylvania .
thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
now , that could be because we haven 't been sampling right , but it does , i think , suggest that something 's wrong with the pollinator force . and these bees are fascinating .
we have bumblebees on the top .
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they 're not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
they 're like tiny little flies and they fly around .
and then you have another type of bee , which we call kleptoparasites , which is a very fancy way of saying , bad-minded , murdering -- what 's the word i 'm looking for ? murdering -- audience : bee ?
dennis vanengelsdorp : bee . okay , thanks .
what these bees do is , they sit there . these solitary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect pollen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it .
well , these bees hang out at that hole , and they wait for that mother to fly away , they go in , eat the egg , and lay their own egg there . so they don 't do any work .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they 're top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and in fact , there is now a red list of pollinators that we 're worried have disappeared , and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites , but also these bumblebees .
and in fact , if you guys live on the west coast , go to these websites here , and they 're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees , because we think some have gone extinct . or some , the population has declined .
and so it 's not just honeybees that are in trouble , but we don 't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
there are other animals that pollinate , like bats , and bats are in trouble too .
and i 'm glad i 'm a bee man and not a bat man , because there 's no money to research the bat problems .
and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
if there 's a cave in new york that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . that 's like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
and so that 's incredible . and there 's no money to do that . but i 'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is ndd : nature deficit disorder .
and that is that i think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
and i think if we reconnect to nature , we 'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
and that is , make meadows and not lawns .
and i think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment .
i 've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .
and if we look at the history of lawns , it 's actually rather tragic .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they 're totally sterile .
americans spent , in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns .
five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns .
and so it 's incredible the amount of resources we 've spent keeping our lawns , which are these useless biosystems .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
in fact , you know , the white house used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in world war i , which probably is not a bad idea ; it wouldn 't be a bad idea .
i want to say this not because i 'm opposed completely to mowing lawns .
i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale , and i think we 're encouraged to do that .
but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas we 've heard here , because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational .
that it is amazing that connection we can have with what 's there .
these milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years . add to watch the different plants , or insects , that come to these flowers , to watch that -- and we 've heard about , you know , this relationship you can have with wine , this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances .
and this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dries up .
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too .
and i encourage you to look at that .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
bees apparently , can be the gateway to , you know , other things .
so i 'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot , but a pot in a meadow .
but you can also have this great community of city or building-top beekeepers , these beekeepers that live -- this is in paris where these beekeepers live .
and everyone should open a beehive , because it is the most amazing , incredible thing .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
get a beehive and grow a meadow , and watch that life come back into your life .
and so with that , i think that what we can do , if we do this , we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future -- includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows .
and that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one .
and i hope that you experience it and i hope you tell me about it one day .
so thank you very much for being here . thank you very much .

a whistleblower you haven 't heard
thank you . thank you very much .
that was whistling .
i 'm trying to do this in english .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland -- why is he whistling ?
well actually , i 've [ been ] whistling since the age of four , about four .
my dad was always whistling around the house , and i just thought that 's part of communication in my family .
so i whistled along with him .
and actually , till i was 34 , i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling ,
because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
i whistled alone . i whistled in the classroom . i whistled on [ my ] bike . i whistled everywhere .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible christmas music .
and when i hear music that i don 't like , i try to make it better .
so " rudolph the red-nosed reindeer " -- you know it ?
but it can also sound like this .
but during a christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it 's very annoying .
so my sister-in-law asked me a few times , " please stop whistling . "
and i just couldn 't .
and at one point -- and i had some wine , i have to admit that -- at one point i said , " if there was a contest , i would join . "
and two weeks later i received a text message : " you 're going to america . "
so , okay , i 'm going to america .
i would love to , but why ?
so i immediately called her up , of course .
she googled , and she found this world whistling championship in america , of course .
she didn 't expect me to go there .
and i would have lost my face .
i don 't know if that 's correct english .
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean .
i lost my face .
and she thought , " he will never go there . "
but actually i did .
so i went to louisburg , north carolina , southeast united states ,
and i entered the world of whistling .
and i also entered the world championship , and i won there in 2004 .
that was great fun , of course .
and to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- i thought , well let 's go back in 2005 , and i won again .
then i couldn 't participate for a few years .
and in 2008 i entered again in japan , tokyo , and i won again .
so what happened now is i 'm standing here in rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i 'm talking about whistling .
and actually i earn my money whistling at the moment .
so i quit my day job as a nurse .
and i try to live my dream -- well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
okay , i 'm not the only one whistling here .
you say , " huh , what do you mean ? "
well actually , you are going to whistle along .
and then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , " oh , my god .
why ? can i go away ? "
no , you can 't .
actually it 's very simple .
the track that i will whistle is called " fete de la belle . "
it 's about 80 minutes long .
no , no , no . it 's four minutes long .
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
so i whistle the tone .
sorry . i forgot one thing .
you whistle the same tone as me .
i heard a wide variety of tones .
this is very promising .
this is very promising .
i 'll ask the technicians to start the music .
and if it 's started , i just point where you whistle along ,
and we will see what happens .
oh , hah .
i 'm so sorry , technicians .
i 'm so used to that .
i start it myself .
okay , here it is .
okay . it 's easy , isn 't it ?
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself .
max westerman : geert chatrou , the world champion [ of ] whistling .
geert chatrou : thank you . thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / stefano _ mancuso _ the _ roots _ of _ plant _ intelligence.html
plants behave in some oddly intelligent ways : fighting predators , maximizing food opportunities ... but can we think of them as actually having a form of intelligence of their own ? italian botanist stefano mancuso presents intriguing evidence .
biology , collaboration , science
976
stefano mancuso : the roots of plant intelligence
sometimes i go browsing [ through ] a very old magazine .
i found this observation test about the story of the ark .
and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes --
there are more or less 12 mistakes .
some of them are very easy .
there is a funnel , an aerial part , a lamp and clockwork key on the ark .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that 's not reported here .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very long period , and no one is taking care of plants .
noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants .
why ?
in another part of the same story , all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark , so birds , livestock and wild animals .
plants are not living creatures --
this is the point .
that is a point that is not coming out from the bible , but it 's something that really accompanied humanity .
let 's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
here we have the description of the order of nature .
it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
this is not the common man .
the " homo studiosus " -- the studying man .
this is quite comforting for people like me -- i 'm a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation .
but it 's something completely wrong .
you know very well about professors .
but it 's also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ;
they are able to sense .
they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals .
just to give you an example , every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters .
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
well , but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us .
let 's have a look at this short movie now .
we have david attenborough .
now david attenborough is really a plant lover ;
he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior .
now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
when he speaks about animals , [ he ] tends to remove the fact that plants exist .
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet --
that is wrong , completely wrong .
the blue whale , it 's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequoiadendron giganteum .
and this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle , that in " de anima " -- that is a very influential book for the western civilization -- wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
they have just a kind of very low-level soul .
it 's called the vegetative soul , because they lack movement , and so they don 't need to sense .
let 's see .
okay , some of the movements of the plants are very well-known .
this is a very fast movement .
this is a dionaea , a venus fly trap hunting snails --
sorry for the snail .
this has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
but plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
some of them are very well known , like the flowering .
it 's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
and it 's really so graceful ;
it 's like a dancing angel .
they are also able to play --
they are really playing .
these are young sunflowers , and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing .
they are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .
they are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity .
but they are also able to sleep .
this is one , mimosa pudica .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
this is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it 's perfectly conserved .
it 's the same in plants , in insects and in animals .
and so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it 's easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it 's much more easy even ethically .
it 's a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
plants are even able to communicate --
they are extraordinary communicators .
they communicate with other plants .
they are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination .
now with the pollination , it 's a very serious issue for plants , because they move the pollen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
so they need a vector -- and this vector , it 's normally an animal .
many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination , but not just insects ; even birds , reptiles , and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .
this is a serious business .
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen .
but some plants are manipulating animals , like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .
now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
we need to wait until 1880 , when this big man , charles darwin , publishes a wonderful , astonishing book that starts a revolution .
the title is " the power of movement in plants . "
no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin .
in his book , assisted by his son , francis -- who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world , in cambridge -- they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages .
and in the last paragraph of the book , it 's a kind of stylistic mark , because normally charles darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
he wrote that , " it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . "
this is not a metaphor .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
so you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that worms , snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
and it 's not an easy movement because , to have this kind of movement , you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain .
so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here , depicted in blue -- that is called the " transition zone . "
and this region , it 's a very small region --
it 's less than one millimeter .
and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important , you have these kinds of signals here .
the signals that you are seeing here are action potential , are the same signals that the neurons of my brain , of our brain , use to exchange information .
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of rye .
we have almost 14 million roots .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
here were have on the left , the internet and on the right , the root apparatus .
they work in the same way .
they are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
and why are they so similar ?
because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
they work in the same way .
so you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [ continue ] to work .
you can remove 90 percent of the internet and it is [ continuing ] to work .
so , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks .
and another possibility is a technological possibility .
let 's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
we have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
we have the androids that are inspired by man .
but why have we not any plantoid ?
well , if you want to fly , it 's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .
but if you want to explore soils , or if you want to colonize new territory , to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .
we have another possibility we are working [ on ] in our lab , [ which ] is to build hybrids .
it 's much more easy to build hybrids .
hybrid means it 's something that 's half living and half machine .
it 's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .
they have computing power ,
they have electrical signals .
the connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even ethically possible .
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
well , thank you for your attention .
and before i finish , i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation .
thank you .

charlie todd : the shared experience of absurdity
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
because i was new to the city , i didn 't have access to a stage , so i decided to create my own in public places .
so the first project we 're going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride . now this took place in january of 2002 .
and this woman is the star of the video .
she doesn 't know she 's being filmed .
she 's being filmed with a hidden camera .
this is on the 6 train in new york city .
and this is the first stop along the line .
these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
and that 's me right there in a brown coat .
it 's about 30 degrees outside .
i 'm wearing a hat . i 'm wearing a scarf .
and the girl 's going to notice me right here .
and as you 'll see now , i 'm not wearing pants .
so at this point -- at this point she 's noticed me , but in new york there 's weirdos on any given train car .
one person 's not that unusual .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled " rape . "
so she 's noticed the unusual thing , but she 's gone back to her normal life .
now in the meantime , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
they 're going to be entering this car one by one .
we 'll act as though we don 't know each other .
and we 'll act as if it 's just an unfortunate mistake we 've made , forgetting our pants on this cold january day .
so at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
now in the meantime , the two danish guys to the left of the camera , they 're cracking up .
they think this is the funniest thing they 've ever seen before .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
and i love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
so the video won 't show everything .
this goes on for another four stops .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , " thank you . that 's exactly what i needed today , " and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
thank you .
so that 's a still from the video there .
and i love that girl 's reaction so much .
and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do .
and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
it 's a prank , but it 's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride .
and we 've continued to do it every year .
this january , we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in new york -- almost every single train line in the city .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
so i could do more large-scale projects .
well one day i was walking through union square , and i saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
and it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back-lit with florescent lighting , and she was very much onstage , and i couldn 't figure out why she was doing it .
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this .
so i got inspired by that .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
so this project is called look up more . we had 70 actors dress in black .
this was completely unauthorized .
we didn 't let the stores know we were coming .
and i stood in the park giving signals .
the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out " look up more , " the name of the project .
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together .
you 'll see that start right here .
and then we had dancing . we had everyone dance .
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
so then i gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 , and he danced .
there were several other activities .
we had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
there 's a better photo of it .
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
a high school kid in texas wrote me in 2006 and said , " you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around . "
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , " yes , you are correct .
i think i 'll try to do that this weekend . thank you . "
so here 's the video .
so again , this is 2005 .
this is the best buy in new york city .
we had about 80 people show up to participate , entering one-by-one .
there was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
so a very diverse group of people .
and i told people , " don 't work . don 't actually do work .
but also , don 't shop .
just stand around and don 't face products . "
now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt .
everybody else is one of our actors .
the lower level employees thought it was very funny .
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
the managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
you can see them in this footage .
they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
and you can see the cops in this footage right here .
that 's a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
thank you .
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
so i like that concept of using their own technology against them .
i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
and one morning , i was riding the subway . i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st. stop where there are these two giant escalators .
and it 's a very depressing place to be in the morning , it 's very crowded .
so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
so this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
it 's morning rush hour .
it 's very cold outside .
people are coming in from queens , transferring from the e train to the 6 train .
and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
thank you . so there 's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
he gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
so i 'd say over the years , one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is : " these people have too much time on their hands . "
and you know , not everybody 's going to like everything you do , and i 've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments , but that one 's always bothered me , because we don 't have too much time on our hands .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
you know , every saturday and sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
and i 've never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , " all those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . " and of course they don 't .
it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library .
or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire .
you know , as kids , we 're taught to play .
and we 're never given a reason why we should play .
it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing .
and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere .
it 's that there is no point and that there doesn 't have to be a point .
we don 't need a reason .
as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that 's enough for us .
and i think , as adults , we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play .
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / sonaar _ luthra _ meet _ the _ water _ canary.html
after a crisis , how can we tell if water is safe to drink ? current tests are slow and complex , and the delay can be deadly , as in the cholera outbreak after haiti 's earthquake in 2010 . ted fellow sonaar luthra previews his design for a simple tool that quickly tests water for safety -- the water canary .

sonaar luthra : meet the water canary
cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
we 've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage , but we still can 't do that with water , and here 's why .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
it 's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
and it ignores the fact that , in the meanwhile , people still need to drink water .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn 't come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they 're safe .
i 've been inspired by that simplicity as i 've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i 've ever known .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
it 's in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
we call it the water canary .
it 's a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : is this water contaminated ?
it doesn 't require any special training .
and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place , it uses light .
that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
to test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .
this will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold .
we 're also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time .
with enough users , maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action , containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from .
and then , instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most , it can happen automatically .
we 've seen how distributed networks , big data and information can transform society .
i think it 's time for us to apply them to water .
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
thank you .

philosopher dan dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools , so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon . then he takes on the purpose-driven life , disputing its claim that , to be moral , one must deny evolution .

dan dennett 's response to rick warren
it 's wonderful to be back .
i love this wonderful gathering .
and you must be wondering , " what on earth ?
have they put up the wrong slide ? "
no , no .
look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it ?
this is ted .
this is technology , entertainment , design and there 's a dairy cow .
it 's a quite wonderfully designed animal .
and i was thinking , how do i introduce this ?
and i thought , well , maybe that old doggerel by joyce kilmer , you know : " poems are made by fools like me , but only god can make a tree . "
and you might say , " well , god designed the cow . "
but , of course , god got a lot of help .
this is the ancestor of cattle .
this is the oryx .
and it was designed by natural selection , the process of natural selection , over many millions of years .
and then it became domesticated thousands of years ago .
and human beings became its stewards ,
and , without even knowing what they were doing , they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it .
and then , more recently , they really began to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better .
now why am i talking about cows ?
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
religions are natural phenomena .
they 're just as natural as cows .
they have evolved over millennia .
they have a biological base , just like the oryx .
they have become domesticated , and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .
this is ted , and i want to talk about design .
because what i 've been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion , and in the last four years i 've been working just about non-stop on this topic .
and you might say it 's about the reverse engineering of religions . now that very idea , i think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
i want to say , no , religions are an important natural phenomenon .
we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore .
today 's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed .
they 're immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .
and , as with the cow , there 's a mixture of evolutionary design , designed by natural selection itself , and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .
you don 't do book talks at ted , but i 'm going to have just one slide about my book , because there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear .
and i would be very interested to get your responses to this .
it 's the one policy proposal that i make in the book , at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make .
and it 's one that echoes remarks that you 've heard already today .
here 's my proposal .
i 'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religions , on world religions , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home schooling .
so what i 'm proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , arithmetic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their creeds , about their texts , their music , their symbolisms , their prohibitions , their requirements . and this should be presented factually , straightforwardly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
that , i think , is maximal tolerance for religious freedom .
as long as you inform your children about other religions , then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed you want them to learn .
but also let them know about other religions .
now why do i say that ?
because democracy depends on an informed citizenship . informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy .
misinformed consent is not worth it .
it 's like a coin flip ; it doesn 't count really .
democracy depends on informed consent .
this is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
i 'm going to use a word that pastor rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
they don 't own them .
you can 't own your children .
you have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right .
you may teach them whatever creed you think is most important , but i say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world , too .
the reason i 've taken this time is i 've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this .
one reviewer for a roman catholic newspaper called it " totalitarian . "
it strikes me as practically libertarian .
is it totalitarian to require reading , writing and arithmetic ?
i don 't think so .
all i 'm saying is -- facts . facts only .
no values , just facts about all the world 's religions .
another reviewer called it " hilarious . "
well , i 'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious .
it seems to me to be such a plausible , natural extension of the democratic principles we already have , that i 'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous .
i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .
i don 't think that 's defensible , but i 'd really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later .
but now i 'm going to move on .
back to the cow .
this picture , which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .
that 's the steward .
cows couldn 't live without human stewards -- they 're domesticated . they 're a sort of ectosymbiont .
they depend on us for their survival .
and pastor rick was just talking about sheep .
i 'm going to talk about sheep , too .
there 's a lot of serendipitous convergence here .
how clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds !
think of what this got them .
they could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators , food finding , health maintenance .
the only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating .
what a deal .
" how clever of sheep ! " you might say .
except , of course , it wasn 't the sheep 's cleverness .
we all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they 're not very smart .
it wasn 't the cleverness of the sheep at all .
they were clueless .
but it was a very clever move .
whose clever move was it ?
it was a clever move of natural selection itself .
francis crick , the co-discoverer of the structure of dna with jim watson , once joked about what he called orgel 's second rule .
leslie orgel is still a molecular biologist , brilliant guy , and orgel 's second rule is : evolution is cleverer than you are .
now , that is not intelligent design -- not from francis crick .
evolution is cleverer than you are .
if you understand orgel 's second rule , then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what 's discovered .
but the process itself is without purpose ,
without foresight , without design .
when i was here four years ago , i told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass .
and why was the ant doing it ?
well , it 's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
it was sort of a spooky story .
and i think some people may have misunderstood .
lancet flukes aren 't smart .
i submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot .
they 're not really bright . they don 't have to be .
the lesson we learn from this is you don 't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
the design is there in nature , but it 's not in anybody 's head .
it doesn 't have to be .
that 's the way evolution works .
the question -- was domestication good for sheep ?
it was great for their genetic fitness .
and here i want to remind you of a wonderful point that paul maccready made at ted three years ago .
here 's what he said .
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one per cent of the terrestrial vertebrae landmass .
that was just 10,000 years ago .
yesterday , in biological terms .
what is it today ? does anybody remember what he told us ?
98 percent .
that is what we have done on this planet .
now , i talked to paul afterwards .
i wanted to check to find out how he 'd calculated this ,
and get the sources and so forth .
and he gave me a paper that he had written on this .
there was a passage in it which he did not present here and i think it is so good i 'm going to read it to you .
" over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life : complex , improbable , wonderful and fragile . suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
we now wield the paintbrush . "
we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish .
life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
and we 're the ones that hold the paintbrush .
and how can we do that ?
the key to our domination of the planet is culture ,
and the key to culture is religion .
suppose martian scientists came to earth .
they would be puzzled by many things .
anybody know what this is ?
i 'll tell you what it is .
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
here 's a big crowd .
here 's another crowd in mecca .
martians would be amazed by this .
they 'd want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
actually , i 'm going to pass over this .
the ant isn 't alone .
there 's all sorts of wonderful cases of species .
in that case , a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
and it turns the mouse into mighty mouse -- it makes it fearless , so it runs out in the open , where it 'll be eaten by a cat .
true story .
in other words , we have these hijackers -- you 've seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness .
does that ever happen to us ?
yes , it does -- quite wonderfully .
the arabic word " islam " means " submission . "
it means " surrender of self-interest to the will of allah . "
but i 'm not just talking about islam .
i 'm talking also about christianity .
this is a parchment music page that i found in a paris bookstall 50 years ago .
and on it it says , in latin : the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ . "
same idea ! well , not quite .
but in fact , christians , too , glory in the fact that they have surrendered to god .
i 'll give you a few quotes .
" the heart of worship is surrender .
surrendered people obey god 's words , even if it doesn 't make sense . "
those words are by rick warren .
those are from " the purpose driven life . "
and i want to turn now , briefly , to talk about that book , which i 've read .
you 've all got a copy .
you 've just heard the man .
and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint , because i think it 's actually a brilliant book .
first of all , the goal .
and you heard just now what the goal is .
it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
is it a good goal ?
in itself , i 'm sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
he 's absolutely right .
there are lots of people out there who don 't have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
i give him an a + on this .
is the goal achieved ?
yes .
30 million copies of this book .
al gore , eat your heart out .
just exactly what al is trying to do , rick is doing .
this is a fantastic achievement .
and , the means -- how does he do it ?
it 's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them , quietly dropping obsolete features , putting new interpretations on other features .
this is the evolution of religion that 's been going on for thousands of years , and he 's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it .
i don 't have to tell you this . you 've just heard the man .
excellent insights into human psychology , wise advice on every page .
moreover , he invites us to look under the hood .
i really appreciated that .
for instance , he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses .
the book is clear , vivid , accessible , beautifully formatted .
just enough repetition .
that 's really important .
every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
with me , everybody -- every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
thank you .
and now we come to my problem .
because i 'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that i 've said about this book .
but i wish it were better .
i have some problems with the book .
and it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .
i wish he could do this with a revision , a mark 2 version of his book .
" the truth will set you free " -- that 's what it says in the bible , and it 's something that i want to live by , too .
my problem is , some of the bits in it i don 't think are true .
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that 's not my main complaint .
that 's worth mentioning .
here 's a passage -- it 's very much what he said , anyway .
" if there was no god we would all be accidents , the result of astronomical random chance in the universe .
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth . "
now , i just do not believe that .
by the way , i find homer groening 's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim .
yes , there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong .
we don 't need a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us .
but that is just a difference of opinion .
that 's not what i 'm really worried about .
how about this -- " god designed this planet 's environment just so we could live in it . "
i 'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don 't have to do the sorts of things that al gore is trying so hard to get us to do .
i 'm not happy with that sentiment at all .
and then i find this -- " all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . "
well , that 's michael denton . he 's a creationist .
and here i think , " wait a minute . "
i read this again .
i read it three or four times and i think , " is he really endorsing intelligent design ?
is he endorsing creationism here ? "
and you can 't tell .
so i 'm sort of thinking , " well , i don 't know , i don 't know if i want to get upset with this yet . "
but then i read on and i read this : " first , noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up . "
i wish that sentence weren 't in there , because i think it is false .
and i think that thinking this way about the history of the planet , after we 've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years , discourages people from scientific understanding .
now , rick warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way .
here 's one : " god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique .
he carefully mixed the dna cocktail that created you . "
i think that 's false .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
here 's another one -- " for instance , your brain can store 100 trillion facts .
your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second . "
well , it would be interesting to find the interpretation where i would accept that .
there might be some way of treating that as true .
" anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge , hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being , an inbuilt need to connect with god . "
well , there 's a sense which i agree with him , except i think it has an evolutionary explanation .
and what i find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an intelligent designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection .
and i think , on the contrary , that it is very important to solving the world 's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously .
whose truth are we going to listen to ?
well , this from " the purpose driven life " -- " the bible must become the authoritative standard for my life , the compass i rely on for direction , the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating everything . "
well maybe , ok , but what 's going to follow from this ?
and here 's one that does concern me .
remember i quoted him before with this line -- " surrendered people obey god 's word , even if it doesn 't make sense . "
and that 's a problem .
" don 't ever argue with the devil .
he 's better at arguing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . "
now rick warren didn 't invent this clever move .
it 's an old move .
it 's a very clever adaptation of religions .
it 's a wildcard for disarming any reasonable criticism .
" you don 't like my interpretation ?
you 've got a reasonable objection to it ?
don 't listen , don 't listen !
that 's the devil speaking . "
this discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have .
i 've got one more problem , then i 'm through .
and i 'd really like to get a response if rick is able to do it .
" in the great commission , jesus said , ' go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples . baptize them in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit , and teach them to do everything i 've told you . ' "
the bible says jesus is the only one who can save the world .
now here we 've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so .
here 's one , not as beautiful as the others .
it simply shows the religions of the world .
and here 's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions .
now do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , " don 't listen to the other side , that 's just satan talking ! "
it seems to me that that 's a very problematic ship to get on for the future .
i found this sign as i was driving to maine recently , in front of a church -- " good without god becomes zero . " sort of cute .
a very clever little meme .
i don 't believe it and i think this idea , popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .
if you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged atheists , agnostics , who are being very good without god .
and you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works .
so , i wish we could drop this meme .
i wish this meme would go extinct .
thanks very much for your attention .

julian treasure says our increasingly noisy world is gnawing away at our mental health -- even costing lives . he lays out an 8-step plan to soften this sonic assault and restore our relationship with sound .

julian treasure : shh ! sound health in 8 steps
the hindus say , " nada brahma , " one translation of which is , " the world is sound . "
and in a way , that 's true , because everything is vibrating .
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
so you are , in fact , a chord -- each of you an individual chord .
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony .
your ears can 't hear that chord ;
they can actually hear amazing things . your ears can hear 10 octaves .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
they work even when you sleep .
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters .
the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that .
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
listening is an active skill ,
whereas hearing is passive , listening is something that we have to work at --
it 's a relationship with sound .
and yet it 's a skill that none of us are taught .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
here are two of them .
reductive listening is listening " for . "
it reduces everything down to what 's relevant and it discards everything that 's not relevant .
men typically listen reductively .
so he 's saying , " i 've got this problem . "
he 's saying , " here 's your solution . thanks very much . next . "
that 's the way we talk , right guys ?
expansive listening , on the other hand , is listening " with , " not listening " for . "
it 's got no destination in mind --
it 's just enjoying the journey .
women typically listen expansively . if you look at these two , eye contact , facing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening ,
and you can transform your relationships .
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
noise like this , according to the european union , is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of europe .
two percent of the population of europe -- that 's 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in europe .
it 's a really big problem .
now , when you were little , if you had noise and you didn 't want to hear it , you 'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum .
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler .
it looks a bit like this .
the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .
the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined : " schizophonia . "
it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear .
so , we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
i think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia .
the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this .
listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed .
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
there is a cost of compression .
it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data .
you 're having to imagine it .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
one study at an american university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
now that 's a really serious problem .
i 'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please .
professional hearing protectors are great ; i use some all the time .
if you 're going to use headphones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don 't have to have it so loud .
if you can 't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it 's too loud .
and thirdly , if you 're in bad sound , it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it .
protect your ears in that way .
let 's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out .
wwb : wind , water , birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
seek those sounds out ; they 're good for you and so it this .
silence is beautiful .
the elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art .
have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion . it 's fun to get into designing with sound .
if you can 't do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
sound design is the future , and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the world sounds .
i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities , eight ways sound can improve health .
first , ultrasound : we 're very familiar with it from physical therapy ;
it 's also now being used to treat cancer .
lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
it 's been around for thousands of years .
i do urge you to explore this .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and music , of course . just listening to music is good for you , if it 's music that 's made with good intention , made with love , generally .
devotional music , good -- mozart , good .
there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved .
first of all , listen consciously .
i hope that that after this talk you 'll be doing that .
it 's a whole new dimension to your life and it 's wonderful to have that dimension .
secondly , get in touch with making some sound --
create sound .
the voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? get trained ;
learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
musicians have bigger brains -- it 's true .
you can do this in groups as well .
it 's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
and let 's take a stewarding role for the sound around us .
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely .
design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work .
and let 's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on .
so i 'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction .
so i urge you to take that path .
i 'm leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
i wish you sound health .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / janna _ levin _ the _ sound _ the _ universe _ makes.html
we think of space as a silent place . but physicist janna levin says the universe has a soundtrack -- a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space . an accessible and mind-expanding soundwalk through the universe .

janna levin : the sound the universe makes
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
the sun burns our peripheral vision . we see light reflected off the moon . and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
and with all of our modern telescopes , we 've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn 't silent .
i 'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself ,
because space can wobble like a drum .
it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold .
now we 'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition .
and while we 've never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the volume on what 's going on out there .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song ,
which i 'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
we can 't see them directly .
they 're not brought to us with light , at least not directly .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
they destroy stars around them .
they churn up debris in their surroundings .
but they won 't come to us directly through light .
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven 't yet .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they 're not seen , and that 's because they bang on space-time like a drum .
now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein -- to whom we owe so much .
einstein realized that if space were empty , if the universe were empty , it would be like this picture , except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .
but if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe .
einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space ,
and a freely falling object would pass by , let 's say , the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
it was einstein 's great general theory of relativity .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
and you can be bent so much that you 're caught in orbit around the sun , as the earth is , or the moon around the earth .
these are the natural curves in space .
what einstein did not realize was that , if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe .
it wasn 't einstein who realized this , it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i -- joined the german army already an accomplished scientist , working on the russian front .
i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating einstein 's equations -- as you do in the trenches .
and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
and even light could not escape this current .
light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
now he wrote to einstein , and he said , " as you will see , the war has been kind to me enough . despite the heavy gunfire ,
i 've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . "
and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution , and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist .
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
and he took schwarzschild 's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
he did not believe they existed in nature .
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .
it was decades before the term " black hole " was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they 're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
it 's actually not massive enough .
but if we did a little thought experiment -- as einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun .
and it would be self-illuminated , because now the sun 's gone , we have no other source of light -- so let 's make our little earth self-illuminated .
and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole .
this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan , more or less .
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth .
but basically that 's what we 're talking about .
we 're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan .
so we move this earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it 's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole .
there 's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
but what 's very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the earth .
it cannot hide behind the black hole .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
so you can 't hide anything behind a black hole .
if this were battlestar galactica and you 're fighting the cylons , don 't hide behind the black hole .
they can see you .
now , our sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it 's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn 't , anymore than light can escape .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it 's not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
and even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole .
it would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it 's a total death experience .
and there 's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel .
now we 've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they 're not seen .
imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
so now we 're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
they can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
at the end of their lives , they 're going around each other very near the speed of light .
so they 're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second ,
and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
this computer simulation is due to a relativity group at nasa goddard .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
this was one of the groups .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
and if you can see -- it 's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
they 're literally the sounds of space ringing , and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning , quiet black hole at the end of the day .
if you were standing near enough , your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space .
you would literally hear the sound .
now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what 's going on .
but i 'd like to play for you the sound that we predict .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
the sound you 're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
if it gets far away , it 's a little too quiet .
but it comes in like a mallet , and it literally cracks space , wobbling it like a drum .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
we know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
and eventually , we 're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
then it 's gone .
now i 've never heard it that loud -- it 's actually more dramatic .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
it 's sort of like ding , ding , ding .
this is another sound from my group .
no , i 'm not showing you any images , because black holes don 't leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this , you want to get moving .
want to get away from the sound .
both black holes are moving .
both black holes are getting closer together .
in this case , they 're both wobbling quite a lot .
and then they 're going to merge .
now it 's gone .
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
now that 's our prediction for what we 'll see .
luckily we 're at this safe distance in long beach , california .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
and surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
it 's a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it 's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
there 's also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa . and lisa will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
they look like they 're frozen in some embrace .
and each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
but they 're not frozen ; they 're actually merging .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
it 's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
but lisa could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe 's history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together .
and it 's not just black holes , but it 's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the big bang .
when that expression was coined , it was derisive -- like , " oh , who would believe in a big bang ? " but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang . it might make a sound .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
we don 't ever want to do that actually . we want to be inside the universe because there 's no such thing as standing outside the universe .
so imagine you 're inside the big bang .
it 's everywhere , it 's all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies ,
and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
and here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
that song has been ringing through space for all that time .
we weren 't even here .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we 're still doing cave paintings .
it 's like hurry , build your instruments .
it 's getting closer and closer , and in 20 ... whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we 'll build them , we 'll turn on the machines and , bang , we 'll catch it -- the first song from space .
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
it 's a terrible sound .
it 's literally the definition of noise .
it 's white noise ; it 's such a chaotic ringing .
but it 's around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn 't been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
and if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
so within the next few years , we 'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit , render the universe in audio .
but if we detect those earliest moments , it 'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
if we run the movie of our universe backwards , we know that there was a big bang in our past , and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it , but was our big bang the only big bang ?
i mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
will it happen again ?
i mean , in the spirit of rising to ted 's challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
but we have to ask : is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history ?
or , is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own big bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
here 's my multiverse creatures .
are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ?
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
thank you . thank you .

nalini nadkarni : life science in prison
trees epitomize stasis .
trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations ,
but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing .
and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas ,
and that produced art .
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir ,
and what i learned was that different species have different signatures , like a picasso versus a monet .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it ,
so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
you might have a guess .
the answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism ,
and one of those entities is our prisons .
prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
and our prison system itself is stuck .
the united states has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
that number is rising .
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining ,
so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons ,
and i think the answer is yes .
in the year 2007 , i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections . working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons .
we give science lectures ,
and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
that , i think , is movement .
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .
that , i think , is movement .
we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands .
that , i think , is movement .
and just recently , we 've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .
they 've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
they 're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they 're placed in immobile booths like this .
for one hour a day they 're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards .
although we can 't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months ,
and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .

swami dayananda saraswati : the profound journey of compassion
a human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer .
it cannot be consciously a contributor .
it is helpless .
it doesn 't know how to survive , even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive .
it needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive .
it can 't afford to doubt the person who tends the child .
it has to totally surrender , as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist .
it has to totally surrender .
that implies a lot of trust .
that implies the trusted person won 't violate the trust .
as the child grows , it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .
it doesn 't know even the word " violation . "
therefore , it has to blame itself ,
a wordless blame , which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame .
as the child grows to become an adult : so far , it has been a consumer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute , to be a contributor .
one cannot contribute unless one feels secure , one feels big , one feels : i have enough .
to be compassionate is not a joke .
it 's not that simple .
one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
the self : you are self-aware .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness . otherwise , compassion is just a word and a dream .
you can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion .
thank god we are empathetic .
when somebody 's in pain , we pick up the pain .
in a wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
each one has got two games .
it can be anybody 's game .
what they have sweated so far has no meaning .
one person wins .
the tennis etiquette is , both the players have to come to the net and shake hands .
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it .
and this guy has to come to the net .
when he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes .
it looks as though he 's wishing that he didn 't win .
why ? empathy .
that 's human heart .
no human heart is denied of that empathy .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
no culture , no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy .
and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life --
even words , even time .
compassion is not defined in one form .
there 's no indian compassion .
there 's no american compassion .
it transcends nation , the gender , the age .
why ? because it is there in everybody .
it 's experienced by people occasionally .
then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about --
it will never remain occasional .
by mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate .
you can 't say , " please love me . "
love is something you discover .
it 's not an action , but in the english language , it is also an action .
i will come to it later .
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody 's experience .
in spite of a very tragic life , one is happy in moments which are very few and far between .
and the one who is happy , even for a slapstick joke , accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself .
that means the whole universe , known things and unknown things .
all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself .
the subject -- " me " -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , " i am denied of , " an experience common to all and sundry .
that experience confirms that , in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants , desires , unfulfilled , and the credit cards and layoffs and , finally , baldness -- you can be happy .
but the extension of the logic is that you don 't need to fulfill your desire to be happy .
you are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be .
there 's no choice in this :
that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you .
it has got to be you .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition :
" maybe i am the whole .
maybe the swami is right .
maybe the swami is right . " you start your new life .
then everything becomes meaningful .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
if one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many . but if i say , in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is limited any which way you look at it . limited .
your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the cheerfulness is going to be limited .
compassion is going to be limited .
everything is going to be limitless .
you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless , and nobody can become limitless , either you are or you are not . period .
and there is no way of your being not limitless too .
your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole .
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
it is love first .
when you relate to the world , the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is , what we say , love .
and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion .
then that again transforms into giving , into sharing .
you express yourself because you have compassion .
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
to discover the capacity to give and share , you need to be giving and sharing .
there is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
you learn swimming by swimming .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
you learn cooking by cooking , having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook .
and , therefore , what i say , you have to fake it and make it .
you need to .
my predecessor meant that .
you have to act it out .
you have to act compassionately .
there is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion .
that 's interesting to me .
you act compassionately .
but then , how to act compassionately if you don 't have compassion ?
that is where you fake .
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the united states of america .
you fake it and make it .
you act compassionately as though you have compassion : grind your teeth , take all the support system . if you know how to pray , pray .
ask for compassion .
let me act compassionately .
do it . you 'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that 's what you are .
with these words , thank you very much .

shirin neshat : art in exile
the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist , as an iranian woman artist , as an iranian woman artist living in exile .
well , it has its pluses and minuses .
on the dark side , politics doesn 't seem to escape people like me .
every iranian artist , in one form or another , is political .
politics have defined our lives .
if you 're living in iran , you 're facing censorship , harassment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
if you 're living outside like me , you 're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
therefore , we don 't find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .
oddly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if i have , indeed , no access to my own country .
also , people like myself , we 're fighting two battles on different grounds .
we 're being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
we are there to take pride and insist on respect .
and at the same time , we 're fighting another battle .
that is our regime , our government -- our atrocious government , [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power .
our artists are at risk .
we are in a position of danger .
we pose a threat to the order of the government .
but ironically , this situation has empowered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social discourse in iran .
we are there to inspire , to provoke , to mobilize , to bring hope to our people .
we are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world .
art is our weapon .
culture is a form of resistance .
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression . for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics . from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture .
but also , i worry about the west , because often in this country , in this western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
my journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
i did not start to make social commentary about my country .
the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated for a good 12 years .
it was after the islamic revolution of 1979 .
while i was absent from iran , the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture .
i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn 't recognize anymore .
more so , i became very interested , as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions , i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution -- how , indeed , it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women .
i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation .
so in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ideology of the country .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
for me , this became incredibly important .
and yet , i had an unusual position toward this .
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution .
this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn 't know i would discover .
so my art became slightly more critical .
my knife became a little sharper .
and i fell into a life in exile .
i am a nomadic artist .
i work in morocco , in turkey , in mexico .
i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran .
now i am making films .
last year , i finished a film called " women without men . "
" women without men " returns to history , but another part of our iranian history .
it goes to 1953 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader , dr. mossadegh .
the book is written by an iranian woman , shahrnush parsipur .
it 's a magical realist novel .
this book is banned , and she spent five years in prison .
my obsession with this book , and the reason i made this into a film , is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally , historically in iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change , freedom and democracy -- while the country of iran , equally , as if another character , also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions .
i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to speak to the westerners about our history as a country .
that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized -- in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life .
and most of all , in the way that we fought for democracy .
these are some of the shots actually from my film .
these are some of the images of the coup .
and we made this film in casablanca , recreating all the shots .
this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story , but also a feminine story .
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art .
the challenge i have is how to do that . how to tell a political story but an allegorical story . how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of tehran .
what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film , the cry for democracy and social justice , repeats itself now again in tehran .
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy .
what was most significant for me was , once again , the presence of the women .
they 're absolutely inspirational for me .
if in the islamic revolution , the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn 't have a voice , now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran -- women who were educated , forward thinking , non-traditional , sexually open , fearless and seriously feminist .
these women and those young men united iranians across the world , inside and outside .
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women .
that , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
they have confronted the authority .
they have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way .
and once again , they proved themselves .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist , even if i have to operate in the west only for now .
thank you so much .

salman khan : let 's use video to reinvent education
the khan academy is most known for its collection of videos , so before i go any further , let me show you a little bit of a montage .
salman khan : so the hypotenuse is now going to be five .
this animal 's fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
we can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
national assembly : they create the committee of public safety , which sounds like a very nice committee .
notice , this is an aldehyde , and it 's an alcohol .
start differentiating into effector and memory cells .
a galaxy . hey , there 's another galaxy .
oh look , there 's another galaxy .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
sk : we now have on the order of 2,200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to vector calculus and some of the stuff you saw there .
we have a million students a month using the site , watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day .
but what we 're going to talk about in this is how we 're going to the next level .
but before i do that , i want to talk a little bit about really just how i got started .
and some of you all might know , about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund ,
and i was in boston , and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans , remotely .
and i started putting the first youtube videos up just a supplement for my cousins -- something that might give them a refresher or something .
and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .
the first was the feedback from my cousins .
they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person .
and once you get over the backhanded nature of that , there was actually something very profound there .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin .
at first , it 's very unintuitive , but when you actually think about it from their point of view , it makes a ton of sense .
you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin , without feeling like they 're wasting my time .
if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago , or maybe a couple of years ago , they don 't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin .
they can just watch those videos . if they 're bored , they can go ahead .
they can watch it at their own time , at their own pace .
and probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time , the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept , the very last thing you need is another human being saying , " do you understand this ? " and that 's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before ,
and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it ,
and then people started stumbling on it ,
and i started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people from around the world .
and these are just a few .
this is actually from one of the original calculus videos .
and someone wrote just on youtube -- it was a youtube comment : " first time i smiled doing a derivative . "
and let 's pause here .
this person did a derivative and then they smiled .
and then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .
you can go on youtube and look at these comments -- someone else wrote : " same thing here .
i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day . since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class , and here i 'm all like , ' i know kung fu . ' " and we get a lot of feedback all along those lines .
this clearly was helping people .
but then , as the viewership kept growing and kept growing , i started getting letters from people , and it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a nice-to-have .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters .
" my 12 year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math .
we have tried everything , viewed everything , bought everything .
we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through .
then we went on to the dreaded fractions . again , he got it .
we could not believe it .
he is so excited . " and so you can imagine , here i was an analyst at a hedge fund . it was very strange for me to do something of social value .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
that , not only would it help my cousins right now , or these people who are sending letters , but that this content will never go old , that it could help their kids or their grandkids .
if isaac newton had done youtube videos on calculus , i wouldn 't have to .
assuming he was good . we don 't know .
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , " okay , maybe it 's a good supplement .
it 's good for motivated students .
it 's good for maybe home schoolers . " but i didn 't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom .
but then i started getting letters from teachers .
and the teachers would write , saying , " we 've used your videos to flip the classroom .
you 've given the lectures , so now what we do ... " -- and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow -- " ... what i do is i assign the lectures for homework ,
and what used to be homework , i now have the students doing in the classroom . " and i want to pause here for -- i want to pause here for a second , because there 's a couple of interesting things .
one , when those teachers are doing that , there 's the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did .
they can pause , repeat at their own pace , at their own time .
but the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , letting them do work , having the teacher walk around , having the peers actually be able to interact with each other , these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom .
they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips , not allowed to interact with each other .
a teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagonistic -- and now it 's a human experience .
now they 're actually interacting with each other .
so once the khan academy -- i quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we 're a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ?
how do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion ?
and so what i 'm showing you over here , these are actual exercises that i started writing for my cousins .
the ones i started were much more primitive .
this is a more competent version of it .
but the paradigm here is , we 'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row .
and the khan academy videos are there .
you get hints , the actual steps for that problem , if you don 't know how to do it .
but the paradigm here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on .
but it 's fundamentally different than what 's happening in classrooms right now .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam .
and that exam , whether you get a 70 percent , an 80 percent , a 90 percent or a 95 percent , the class moves on to the next topic .
and even that 95 percent student , what was the five percent they didn 't know ?
maybe they didn 't know what happens when you raise something to the zero power .
and then you go build on that in the next concept .
that 's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle , and maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time , and i give you that bicycle for two weeks .
and then i come back after two weeks , and i say , " well , let 's see . you 're having trouble taking left turns .
you can 't quite stop .
you 're an 80 percent bicyclist . " so i put a big c stamp on your forehead and then i say , " here 's a unicycle . " but as ridiculous as that sounds , that 's exactly what 's happening in our classrooms right now .
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers ,
and it 's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .
so our model is learn math the way you 'd learn anything , like the way you would learn a bicycle .
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
do it as long as necessary until you have mastery .
the traditional model , it penalizes you for experimentation and failure , but it does not expect mastery .
we encourage you to experiment . we encourage you to failure .
but we do expect mastery .
this is just another one of the modules .
this is trigonometry .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
and they all fit together .
we have about 90 of these right now .
and you can go to the site right now . it 's all free . not trying to sell anything .
but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map .
that top node right there , that 's literally single digit addition .
it 's like one plus one is equal to two .
and the paradigm is , once you get 10 in a row on that , it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules .
so if you keep further down the knowledge map , we 're getting into more advanced arithmetic .
further down , you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra .
further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus .
and the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework .
so you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic , you have computer programming , you have grammar , you have genetics , all based off of that core of , if you know this and that , now you 're ready for this next concept .
now that can work well for an individual learner , and i encourage , one , for you to do it with your kids , but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself .
it 'll change what happens at the dinner table .
but what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about .
and so what i 'm showing you here , this is actually data from a pilot in the los altos school district , where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum .
these kids aren 't using textbooks , they 're not getting one-size-fits-all lectures .
they 're doing khan academy , they 're doing that software , for roughly half of their math class .
and i want to make it clear , we don 't view this as the complete math education .
what it does is -- and this is what 's happening in los altos -- it frees up time .
this is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow .
and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live dashboard from los altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard .
every row is a student .
every column is one of those concepts .
green means the student 's already proficient .
blue means they 're working on it -- no need to worry .
red means they 're stuck .
and what the teacher does is literally just say , " let me intervene on the red kids . " or even better , " let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer . " now i come from a very data-centric reality , so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : " oh , what do you not understand ? " or " what do you do understand ? " and all of the rest .
so our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible -- really data that , in almost any other field , is expected , if you 're in finance or marketing or manufacturing --
and so the teachers can actually diagnose what 's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible .
so now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been spending every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pause the videos , what did they stop watching , what exercises are they using , what have they been focused on ?
the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on .
the inner circle shows the videos they 're focused on .
and the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .
red is wrong , blue is right .
the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted .
they watched the video right over there .
and then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row .
it 's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
they also got faster .
the height is how long it took them .
so when you talk about self-paced learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak , differentiated learning -- but it 's kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom .
because every time we 've done this , in every classroom we 've done , over and over again , if you go five days into it , there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and there 's a group of kids who are a little bit slower .
and in a traditional model , if you did a snapshot assessment , you say , " these are the gifted kids , these are the slow kids .
maybe they should be tracked differently .
maybe we should put them in different classes . " but when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit [ of ] extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead .
and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago , you now would think are gifted .
and we 're seeing it over and over and over again .
and it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time .
now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos , our goal is to use technology to humanize , not just in los altos , but on a global scale , what 's happening in education .
and actually , that kind of brings an interesting point .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
in our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
so in a traditional model , most of the teacher 's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot .
maybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them .
now 100 percent of their time is .
so once again , using technology , not just flipping the classroom , you 're humanizing the classroom , i 'd argue , by a factor of five or 10 .
and as valuable as that is in los altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
imagine what it does to a street kid in calcutta who has to help his family during the day , and that 's the reason why he or she can 't go to school .
now they can spend two hours a day and remediate , or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don 't know .
now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom .
but this is all one system .
there 's no reason why you can 't have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom .
imagine what happens if that student in calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son , or your son can tutor that kid in calcutta ?
and i think what you 'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .
and that 's essentially what we 're trying to build .
thank you .
bill gates : i 've seen some things you 're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges .
tell me what you 're thinking there .
sk : oh yeah . no , we have an awesome team working on it .
and i have to make it clear , it 's not just me anymore .
i 'm still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
yeah , we 've put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get these badges , we 're going to start having leader boards by area , and you get points .
it 's actually been pretty interesting .
just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something , we see on a system-wide basis , like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another , depending what badge you give them .
bg : and the collaboration you 're doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
sk : los altos , it was kind of crazy .
once again , i didn 't expect it to be used in classrooms .
someone from their board came and said , " what would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom ? " and i said , " well , i would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we 'd give a dashboard . " and they said , " oh , this is kind of radical . we have to think about it . " and me and the rest of the team were like , " they 're never going to want to do this . " but literally the next day they were like , " can you start in two weeks ? " bg : so fifth grade math is where that 's going on right now ?
sk : it 's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes .
and they 're doing it at the district level .
i think what they 're excited about is they can now follow these kids .
it 's not an only-in-school thing .
we 've even , on christmas , we saw some of the kids were doing it .
and we can track everything .
so they can actually track them as they go through the entire district .
through the summers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continuity of data that even at the district level they can see .
bg : so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what 's going on with those kids .
so you 're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they mean ?
sk : oh yeah . most of those were specs by the teachers .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves .
and they 're literally saying , " hey , this is nice , but ... " like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , " i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . " so we made that focus diagram .
so it 's all been teacher-driven .
it 's been pretty crazy .
bg : is this ready for prime time ?
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
sk : yeah , it 's ready .
we 've got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more .
no , no reason why it really can 't happen in every classroom in america tomorrow .
bg : and the vision of the tutoring thing .
the idea there is , if i 'm confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface i 'd find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and i could schedule and connect up with those people ?
sk : absolutely . and this is something that i recommend everyone in this audience to do .
those dashboards the teachers have , you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids , or nephews , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the boys and girls club .
and yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately .
but yeah , it 's all there .
bg : well , it 's amazing .
i think you just got a glimpse of the future of education .
thank you .

oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
we see with the eyes ,
but we see with the brain as well .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . we 've lived with them all our lives .
but there are also hallucinations as well ,
and hallucinations are completely different .
they don 't seem to be of our creation .
they don 't seem to be under our control .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations ,
and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things ,
and they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers
or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer 's .
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie , the old lady .
i went in to see her .
it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence ,
but she 'd been very startled and very bewildered , because she 'd been seeing things .
and she told me -- the nurses hadn 't mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
but now , for the last few days , she 'd been seeing things .
so i said , " what sort of things ? "
and she said , " people in eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
a man who turns towards me and smiles .
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
animals too .
i see a white building . it 's snowing , a soft snow .
i see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
then , one night , the scene changes .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me . they come to a certain point and then stop .
then it changes again .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
they wear bright colors , rose and blue , like eastern dress . "
sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling .
i said , " is this like a dream ? "
and she said , " no , it 's not like a dream . it 's like a movie . "
she said , " it 's got color . it 's got motion .
but it 's completely silent , like a silent movie . "
and she said that it 's a rather boring movie .
she said , " all these people with eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . "
and she has a sense of humor .
she knew it was a hallucination .
but she was frightened . she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before .
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing ,
that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
she had no control over them .
she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
and she didn 't know what was going on .
she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
well , i examined her carefully .
she was a bright old lady ,
perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
but she was blind .
and i then said to her , " i think i know what you have . "
i said , " there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness . this was originally described , " i said , " right back in the 18th century , by a man called charles bonnet .
and you have charles bonnet syndrome .
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind .
you have charles bonnet syndrome . "
and she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious .
she said , " who is this charles bonnet ? "
she said , " did he have them himself ? "
and she said , " tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . "
" i 'm not crazy . i 'm not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . "
well , so i did tell the nurses .
now this , for me , is a common situation .
i work in old-age homes , largely .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
you don 't have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
now with the original description in the 18th century , charles bonnet did not have them .
his grandfather had these hallucinations .
his grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
he 'd had cataract surgery .
his vision was pretty poor .
and in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
and he knew it was a hallucination .
you don 't have handkerchiefs in midair .
and then he saw a big wheel in midair .
but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not ,
because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , " and who are these handsome young men with you ? "
and they said , " alas , grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . "
and then the handsome young men disappeared .
it 's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
they don 't usually fade in and out .
they are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
charles lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
on one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
that was the only figure he recognized .
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding .
but when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
with him and with rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and rosalie said , " what 's going on ? " -- and i said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable ,
and they start to fire spontaneously .
and you start to see things .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
with another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
on one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
and then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four
and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
she had very mobile hallucinations as well .
a lot of them had to do with a car .
sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned .
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination . this was a woman who didn 't have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain ,
a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and , above all , she would see cartoons .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog .
now , i don 't watch sesame street ,
but she made a point of saying , " why kermit ? " she said , " kermit the frog means nothing to me .
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
why kermit ?
kermit the frog means nothing to me . "
she didn 't mind the cartoons too much . but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
and these frightened her .
well , what is going on with these people ?
as a physician , i have to try and define what 's going on , and to reassure people ,
especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these .
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them ,
because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
in particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you 're going mad ,
but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . they accuse you .
they seduce you . they humiliate you .
they jeer at you .
you interact with them .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is a film . you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you ,
or that 's how people think about it .
there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy ,
and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
you 're at a particular road junction .
you smell chestnuts roasting .
you hear the traffic . all the senses are involved .
and you 're waiting for your girl .
and it 's that tuesday evening back in 1982 .
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
and one of the second commonest is cartoons .
so , what is going on ?
fascinatingly , in the last few years , it 's been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating .
and in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex .
when images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
and in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces ,
and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented ,
and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
it 's very interesting that that should be specific .
there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes .
around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
" face cells " were discovered around 1970 .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
so you may not only have " car " cells , you may have " aston martin " cells .
i saw an aston martin this morning .
i had to bring it in .
and now it 's in there somewhere .
now , at this level , in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
it 's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
and in the charles bonnet syndrome , you don 't go to those higher levels .
you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination ,
and one is not conscious of them .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
and instead of getting normal perception , you 're getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
so , suddenly you see a face . suddenly you see a car .
suddenly this , and suddenly that .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this ,
but not terribly successfully .
when these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
but in fact people say , " i don 't recognize the people . i can 't form any associations . "
" kermit means nothing to me . "
you don 't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
well , i 've more or less said what i wanted .
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
think of the number of blind people .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
charles bonnet said , 250 years ago -- he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
now , 250 years later , i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done .
thanks very much .
chris anderson : that was superb . thank you so much .
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
oliver sacks : i was afraid you 'd ask that .
well , yeah , a lot of them .
and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself .
i 'm blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
and i see the geometrical hallucinations .
but they stop there .
ca : and they don 't disturb you ?
because you understand what 's doing it , it doesn 't make you worried ?
os : well they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,
which i ignore .
they occasionally interest me ,
and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
i 've gone and had an fmri myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migraine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
ca : that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
thank you so much for sharing .
os : thank you . thank you .

in the deep , dark ocean , many sea creatures make their own light for hunting , mating and self-defense . bioluminescence expert edith widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world . at ted2011 , she brings some of her glowing friends onstage , and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life .

edith widder : the weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
so i want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
and it 's not a trip that requires light-years of travel , but it 's to a place where it 's defined by light .
so it 's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
i 've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
but mostly i 'm entranced by it .
since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , i 've been a bioluminescence junky .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
i needed some way to share the experience directly .
and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called deep rover .
this next video clip , you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence .
and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
narrator : in front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea .
with the sub 's lights switched off , it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh .
this is the first time it has ever been recorded .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
but just to try to prove that fact to you , i 've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration .
so , if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible , i have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it .
and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now , either because they 're dead -- or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
oops . sorry .
i spend most of my time working in the dark ; i 'm used to that .
okay .
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga .
so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
the flash is like a scream for help .
it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm ,
and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
there 's a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
it 's got a light organ under its eye .
it 's got a chin barbel .
it 's got a lot of other light organs you can 't see , but you 'll see in here in a minute .
so we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible .
but it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
it 's unbelievable .
the light organs under the eyes are flashing .
that chin barbel is flashing .
it 's got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights .
it 's a scream for help ; it 's meant to attract attention .
it 's phenomenal .
and you normally don 't get to see this because we 've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
there 's other ways you can defend yourself with light .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
this blinds or distracts the predator .
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .
now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig 's head with wings -- but if it 's attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
it 's phenomenal .
so there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light .
and we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why .
they use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that 's where things get really strange .
and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in " avatar , "
but you don 't have to travel to pandora to see them .
they 're things like this .
this is a golden coral , a bush .
it grows very slowly .
in fact , it 's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed .
the other reason is this amazing bush glows .
so if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that 's just breathtaking .
and you see things like this .
this looks like something out of a dr. seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
and these are flytrap anemones .
now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
but if you keep poking it , it starts to produce light .
and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
it produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense .
there are starfish that can make light .
and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
this looks like a plant , but it 's actually an animal .
and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
but if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
but we have no idea why it does that .
here 's another one . this is also a sea pen .
it 's got a brittle star hitching a ride .
it 's a green saber of light .
and like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light .
so if i squeeze the base , the bands go from base to tip .
if i squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
i 'd be very interested in your theories about what that 's about .
so there 's a language of light in the deep ocean , and we 're just beginning to understand it ,
and one way we 're going about that is we 're imitating a lot of these displays .
this is an optical lure that i 've used .
we call it the electronic jellyfish .
it 's just 16 blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye-in-the-sea that uses far red light that 's invisible to most animals , so it 's unobtrusive .
so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea .
so the camera 's black and white .
it 's not high-resolution .
and what you 're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it .
and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
and when it starts flashing , it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast . but as soon as it starts to flash -- and it 's going to look big , because it blooms on the camera -- i want you to look right here .
there 's something small there that responds . we 're talking to something .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
and this was very consistent .
this was in the bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody 's talking .
and i think this is actually a shrimp that 's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
but the cool thing is , we 're talking to it .
we don 't know what we 're saying .
personally , i think it 's something sexy .
and then finally , i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world 's first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in monterey canyon last year .
we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data .
this is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria .
and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
so this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark .
and i can 't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there 's bait right there .
but if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
that 's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it 's going to be this pinwheel display .
and this is a burglar alarm .
and that was a humboldt squid , a juvenile humboldt squid , about three feet long .
this is at 3,000 feet in monterey canyon .
but if it 's a burglar alarm , you wouldn 't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly .
it 's supposed to be attacking what 's attacking the jellyfish .
but we did see a bunch of responses like this .
this guy is a little more contemplative .
" hey , wait a minute .
there 's supposed to be something else there . "
he 's thinking about it .
but he 's persistent .
he keeps coming back .
and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , " maybe if i come in from a different angle . "
nope .
so we are starting to get a handle on this , but only just the beginnings .
we need more eyes on the process .
so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible , by all means , climb in and take the plunge .
this is something that should be on everybody 's bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
more than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
it 's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don 't have to travel to another planet to see .
but if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights .
but i warn you , it 's addictive .
thank you .

e.o. wilson : advice to young scientists
what i 'm going to do is to just give a few notes , and this is from a book i 'm preparing called " letters to a young scientist . " i 'd thought it 'd be appropriate to present it , on the basis that i have had extensive experience in teaching , counseling scientists across a broad array of fields .
and you might like to hear some of the principles that i 've developed in doing that teaching and counseling . so let me begin by urging you , particularly you on the youngsters ' side , on this path you 've chosen , to go as far as you can .
the world needs you , badly . humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age .
there is going to be no turning back . although varying among disciplines -- say , astrophysics , molecular genetics , the immunology , the microbiology , the public health , to the new area of the human body as a symbiont , to public health , environmental science .
knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every 15 to 20 years . technology is increasing at a comparable rate . between them , the two already pervade , as most of you here seated realize , every dimension of human life . so swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution , so startling in its countless twists and turns , that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment .
there will come a time , of course , when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge , which actually began in the 1600s , has to peak and level off , but that 's not going to matter to you .
the revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades .
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing , inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines .
in time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
the search for knowledge is in our genes . it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it 's never going to be quenched . to understand and use it sanely , as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you .
in education , medicine , law , diplomacy , government , business and the media that exist today .
our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy , which most badly lack today -- no applause , please .
it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job .
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laboratory during the span of your career .
i 'll now proceed quickly , and before else , to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills ,
don 't worry . many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
some may have considered me foolhardy , but it 's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists . during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
these math-phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent . here 's how to relax your anxieties , if you have them : understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages , or like verbal language generally , by its own grammar and system of logic .
any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will , as in verbal language , have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science .
the longer you wait to become at least semi-literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master , just as again in any verbal language , but it can be done at any age .
i speak as an authority on that subject , because i 'm an extreme case .
i didn 't take algebra until my freshman year at the university of alabama .
they didn 't teach it before then .
i finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at harvard , where i sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students , little more than half my age .
a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology .
i swallowed my pride , and i learned calculus .
i found out that in science and all its applications , what is crucial is not that technical ability , but it is imagination in all of its applications .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition . i found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations .
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake .
of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
when something new is discovered , it 's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward .
if that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery , a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator .
consider the following principle , which i will modestly call wilson 's principle number one : it is far easier for scientists including medical researchers , to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations .
it is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply , and focus on that .
keep in mind , then , wilson 's second principle : for every scientist , whether researcher , technician , teacher , manager or businessman , working at any level of mathematical competence , there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence .
now i 'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career , or if you 're teaching , how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists .
in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research , or to develop world-class expertise , take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
this is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement of broad training , or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality .
it is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs , and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support .
but through it all , look for a way to break out , to find a field and subject not yet popular .
we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine .
there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur , as measured in discoveries per investigator per year .
you may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies : march to the sound of the guns .
in science , the exact opposite is the case : march away from the sound of the guns .
so wilson 's principle number three : march away from the sound of the guns .
observe from a distance , but do not join the fray .
make a fray of your own .
once you have settled on a specialty , and the profession you can love , and you 've secured opportunity , your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert .
there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine . and on then into the social sciences , where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority . the world needs this kind of expertise , and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it .
the existing information and what you self-discover may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge . well , if that 's the case , good . why hard instead of easy ?
the answer deserves to be stated as principle number four .
in the attempt to make scientific discoveries , every problem is an opportunity , and the more difficult the problem , the greater will be the importance of its solution .
now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made .
scientists , pure mathematicians among them , follow one or the other of two pathways : first through early discoveries , a problem is identified and a solution is sought .
the problem may be relatively small ; for example , where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread ?
or larger , what 's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
as the answer is sought , other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked .
this first of the two strategies is like a hunter , exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry , who finds other quarries along the way .
the second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call " the naturalist 's trance , " the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting , any quarry worth taking .
the search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
the two strategies of research , original research , can be stated as follows , in the final principle i 'm going to offer you : for every problem in a given discipline of science , there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution .
and conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited .
find out what they are .
you 'll find your own way to discover , to learn , to teach .
the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention , general health , the quality of life . all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master .
you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction , at its conclusion , of a life well lived .
and i thank you for having me here tonight .
oh , thank you .
thank you very much .
i salute you .

drew berry : animations of unseeable biology
what i 'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body .
now molecules are really , really tiny .
and by tiny , i mean really .
they 're smaller than a wavelength of light , so we have no way to directly observe them .
but through science , we do have a fairly good idea of what 's going on down at the molecular scale .
so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules , but we don 't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
and this idea is actually nothing new .
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .
they draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they 're thinking about in their minds .
i picked two well-known examples , because they 're very well-known for expressing science through art .
and i start with galileo who used the world 's first telescope to look at the moon .
and he transformed our understanding of the moon .
the perception in the 17th century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere .
but what galileo saw was a rocky , barren world , which he expressed through his watercolor painting .
another scientist with very big ideas , the superstar of biology , is charles darwin .
and with this famous entry in his notebook , he begins in the top left-hand corner with , " i think , " and then sketches out the first tree of life , which is his perception of how all the species , all living things on earth , are connected through evolutionary history -- the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population .
even as a scientist , i used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible , with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work , until i encountered the artworks of david goodsell , who is a molecular biologist at the scripps institute .
and his pictures , everything 's accurate and it 's all to scale .
and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like .
so this is a transection through blood .
in the top left-hand corner , you 've got this yellow-green area .
the yellow-green area is the fluids of blood , which is mostly water , but it 's also antibodies , sugars , hormones , that kind of thing .
and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell .
and those red molecules are hemoglobin .
they are actually red ; that 's what gives blood its color .
and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .
i was very much inspired by this image many years ago , and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world .
what would it look like ?
and that 's how i really began . so let 's begin .
this is dna in its classic double helix form .
and it 's from x-ray crystallography , so it 's an accurate model of dna .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
those are the letters of genetic code , the 25,000 genes you 've got written in your dna .
this is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code -- this is what they 're talking about .
but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science , and that is the physical nature of dna .
it 's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons i can 't go into right now .
but they physically run in opposite directions , which creates a number of complications for your living cells , as you 're about to see , most particularly when dna is being copied .
and so what i 'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that 's occurring right now inside your body , at least 2002 biology .
so dna 's entering the production line from the left-hand side , and it hits this collection , these miniature biochemical machines , that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an exact copy .
so dna comes in and hits this blue , doughnut-shaped structure and it 's ripped apart into its two strands .
one strand can be copied directly , and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there .
but things aren 't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards .
so it 's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time , creating two new dna molecules .
now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , copying your dna with exquisite fidelity .
it 's an accurate representation , and it 's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
i 've left out error correction and a bunch of other things .
this was work from a number of years ago .
thank you .
this is work from a number of years ago , but what i 'll show you next is updated science , it 's updated technology .
so again , we begin with dna .
and it 's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules , which i 've stripped away so you can see something .
dna is about two nanometers across , which is really quite tiny .
but in each one of your cells , each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it 's wrapped around these purple proteins -- or i 've labeled them purple here .
it 's packaged up and bundled up .
all this field of view is a single strand of dna .
this huge package of dna is called a chromosome .
and we 'll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
we 're pulling out , we 're zooming out , out through a nuclear pore , which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus .
all of this field of view is about a semester 's worth of biology , and i 've got seven minutes .
so we 're not going to be able to do that today ?
no , i 'm being told , " no . "
this is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope .
and it 's been filmed under time-lapse , which is why you can see it moving .
the nuclear envelope breaks down .
these sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes , and we 'll focus on them .
they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots .
when the cell feels it 's ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical copies of dna .
and then the cell splits down the middle .
and again , you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you .
now we 're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it .
so again , here we are at that equator moment .
the chromosomes line up .
and if we isolate just one chromosome , we 're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure .
so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have , at least as far as we 've discovered so far inside of us .
so this is a single chromosome .
and you have two strands of dna in each chromosome .
one is bundled up into one sausage .
the other strand is bundled up into the other sausage .
these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell .
they 're called mircrotubules . that name 's not important .
but what we 're going to focus on is this red region -- i 've labeled it red here -- and it 's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes .
it is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes .
we have no idea really as to how it 's achieving that movement .
we 've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study , and we 're still just beginning to discover what it 's all about .
it is made up of about 200 different types of proteins , thousands of proteins in total .
it is a signal broadcasting system .
it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it 's ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules .
it 's involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it 's able to transiently couple onto them .
it 's also an attention sensing system .
it 's able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly positioned .
it 's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right .
and you 'll see , there 's this one little last bit that 's still remaining red .
and it 's walked away down the microtubules .
that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .
and it 's walked away . i mean , it 's that mechanical .
it 's molecular clockwork .
this is how you work at the molecular scale .
so with a little bit of molecular eye candy , we 've got kinesins , which are the orange ones .
they 're little molecular courier molecules walking one way .
and here are the dynein . they 're carrying that broadcasting system .
and they 've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
the problem is we can 't show it to you any other way .
exploring at the frontier of science , at the frontier of human understanding , is mind-blowing .
discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
but most medical researchers --
discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
thank you .

howard rheingold : the new power of collaboration
i 'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done . here is the old story -- we 've already heard a little bit about it :
biology is war in which only the fiercest survive ;
businesses and nations succeed only by defeating , destroying and dominating competition ;
politics is about your side winning at all costs .
but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge .
it 's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines , in which cooperation , collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role .
and the central , but not all-important , role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room .
i started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when i wrote " smart mobs , " and i found that when i finished the book , i kept thinking about it .
in fact , if you look back , human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time .
humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization
in small family groups . nomadic hunters bring down rabbits , gathering food .
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive .
but at some point , they banded together to hunt bigger game .
and we don 't know exactly how they did this ,
although they must have solved some collective action problems ;
it only makes sense that you can 't hunt mastodons while you 're fighting with the other groups .
and again , we have no way of knowing , but it 's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged .
more protein than a hunter 's family could eat before it rotted .
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms .
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families ?
and if so , how did they make arrangements ?
again , we can 't know , but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .
of course , with agriculture came the first big civilizations , the first cities built of mud and brick , the first empires .
and it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks ; marks on clay in that time .
not too much longer after that , the alphabet was invented .
and this powerful tool was really reserved , for thousands of years , for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires .
and then another communication technology enabled new media :
the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
and from literate populations , new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge , religion and politics .
we saw scientific revolutions , the protestant reformation , constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
and again , new forms of wealth emerged .
now , commerce is ancient . markets are as old as the crossroads .
but capitalism , as we know it , is only a few hundred years old , enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies , such as the joint-stock ownership company , shared liability insurance , double-entry bookkeeping .
now of course , the enabling technologies are based on the internet ,
and in the many-to-many era , every desktop is now a printing press , a broadcasting station , a community or a marketplace .
evolution is speeding up .
more recently , that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops ,
and very , very quickly , we 're going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today .
now , when i started looking into collective action , the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call " social dilemmas . "
and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas .
i 'm going to talk briefly about two of them : the prisoner 's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons .
now , when i talked about this with kevin kelly , he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner 's dilemma ,
so i 'm just going to go over that very , very quickly .
if you have more questions about it , ask kevin kelly later .
the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that 's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war : two players who couldn 't trust each other .
let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner 's dilemma .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they can 't trust each other , are not going to exchange .
neither one wants to be the first one or they 're going to get the sucker 's payoff ,
but both lose , of course , because they don 't get what they want .
if they could only agree , if they could only turn a prisoner 's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game , they could proceed .
twenty years ago , robert axelrod used the prisoner 's dilemma as a probe of the biological question : if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors , how does cooperation exist at all ?
he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner 's dilemma strategies and discovered , much to his surprise , that a very , very simple strategy won --
it won the first tournament , and even after everyone knew it won , it won the second tournament -- that 's known as tit for tat .
another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game ,
and it 's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions .
here 's how the game is played : there are two players ;
they 've never played the game before ,
they will not play the game again , they don 't know each other ,
and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
first player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split : 50 / 50 , 90 / 10 ,
whatever that player wants to propose . the second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over --
or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over .
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it 's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don 't know in another room is going to get 99 .
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that 's not close to 50 / 50 .
and although they were screened and didn 't know about the game and had never played the game before , proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50 / 50 .
now , the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered , to their surprise , that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair .
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness , that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s .
he used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource .
he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it .
now , elinor ostrom , a political scientist , in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask ,
which is : is it really true that humans will always despoil commons ?
so she went out and looked at what data she could find .
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds , forestry resources , fisheries , and discovered that yes , in case after case , humans destroyed the commons that they depended on .
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma ;
in fact , the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner 's dilemma .
and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be .
they escape by creating institutions for collective action .
and she discovered , i think most interestingly , that among those institutions that worked , there were a number of common design
principles , and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don 't work .
i 'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines . in biology , the notions of symbiosis , group selection , evolutionary psychology are contested , to be sure .
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology .
and again , our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned .
rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor .
in fact , people will act to punish cheaters , even at a cost to themselves .
and most recently , neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .
which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together .
now , i 've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms .
commerce is ancient . markets are very old . capitalism is fairly recent ;
socialism emerged as a reaction to that .
and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging .
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler 's paper about open source , pointing to a new form of production : peer-to-peer production .
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past , new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth , we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones .
very briefly , let 's look at some businesses . ibm , as you know , hp , sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software , are providing portfolios of patents for the commons .
eli lilly -- in , again , the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism ;
they 're doing it because they 're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest .
open source production has shown us that world-class software , like linux and mozilla , can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we 've known them .
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense .
amazon has opened its application programming interface to 60,000 developers , countless amazon shops .
they 're enriching others , not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves .
ebay solved the prisoner 's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner 's dilemma game into an assurance game .
instead of , " neither of us can trust each other , so we have to make suboptimal moves , " it 's , " you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate . "
wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years .
we 've seen that thinkcycle has enabled ngos in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world , including something that 's being used for tsunami relief right now :
it 's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that 's so simple to use it , illiterates can be trained to use it .
bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader , making the system more efficient the more it is used .
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they 're not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers --
that 's folding @ home at stanford --
to crack codes , to search for life in outer space .
i don 't think we know enough yet .
i don 't think we 've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,
but i think we can begin to think about them .
and i don 't have enough time to talk about all of them ,
but think about self-interest .
this is all about self-interest that adds up to more .
in el salvador , both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner 's dilemma strategy .
in the u.s. , in the philippines , in kenya , around the world , citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms .
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation ?
i believe that the payoff would be very big .
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines .
and i am not saying that understanding cooperation and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things --
but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago , people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits .
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking .
when the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease , suffering was alleviated .
what forms of suffering could be alleviated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
i don 't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ;
it 's going to require effort .
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
thank you .

blaise aguera y arcas demos augmented-reality maps
about a year and a half ago , stephen lawler , who also gave a talk here at ted in 2007 on virtual earth , brought me over to become the architect of bing maps , which is microsoft 's online-mapping effort .
in the past two and a half , we 've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you 're familiar at all with seadragon , that 's where it comes from .
mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it 's also about imagery .
so , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city , all the facades .
now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out ,
and map 's directions are really just one of them .
if you click on this , you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out , just in the past couple of months since we 've launched .
so , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
this wonderful one which i don 't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
it 's wonderful .
but i 'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
so , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
i 'm not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
everything that 's cased in blue is an area where we 've taken imagery on the ground as well .
and so , when you fly down -- thank you . when you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it 's not just a picture , there 's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if i click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3d understanding behind this model .
now , i 'll show you a fun app that -- we 've been working on a collaboration with our friends at flickr .
this takes flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so -- i 'm not sure if that 's the one i actually meant to pull up , but -- but notice -- this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
so this one was taken around five .
so that 's the flickr photo , that 's our imagery .
so you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
thank you .
there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
and i 'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
but what 's cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that 's something that i 'll be showing you more of in just a moment .
now i just made a transition indoors . that 's also interesting .
ok , notice there 's now a roof above us .
we 're inside the pike place market .
and this is something that we 're able to do with a backpack camera ,
so , we 're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we 're also imaging inside .
and from here , we 're able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
so this is something that we 're now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
ok .
all right , guys , are you there ?
all right . i 'm hitting it . i 'm punching play .
i 'm live . all right . there we go .
so , these are our friends in pike place market , the lab .
so they 're broadcasting this live .
ok , george , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
because i want to show points of interest .
no , no . the other way .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
i don 't want to see you guys yet .
ok , ok , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
ok , never mind .
what i wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you 're actually on the spot ,
you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
what the hell are you guys -- oh , sorry .
we 're doing two different --
ok , i 'm hanging up now .
we 're doing two different things here .
one of them is to take that real ...
all right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
they 've done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
i 'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
and while i walk outside , i 'll just mention that here we 're using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
when you use it on the spot , it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
so here , we 're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
that was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4g network from the market .
all right , and now there 's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years .
and that 's curtis wong , worldwide telescope .
so , we 're going to head over to the dumpsters , where it 's traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
this is the integration of worldwide telescope into our maps .
this is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time . if we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates :
let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
so , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth .
all right now , i 've overrun my time , so i 've got to stop .
thank you all very much .

sophal ear : escaping the khmer rouge
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
but today i 've got a personal story to share with you .
this is a picture of my family , my four siblings -- my mom and i -- taken in 1977 .
and we 're actually cambodians .
and this picture is taken in vietnam .
so how did a cambodian family end up in vietnam in 1977 ?
well to explain that , i 've got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during 1975 and 1979 .
video : april 17th , 1975 .
the communist khmer rouge enters phnom penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in vietnam , and american bombing campaigns .
led by peasant-born pol pot , the khmer rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia , much like mao tse-tung 's cultural revolution in china .
the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
but after four years the grim truth seeps out .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
sophal ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh .
and my parents were told by the khmer rouge to evacuate the city because of impending american bombing for three days .
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
they were young soldiers , typically child soldiers .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict ,
because they 're easy to bring into wars .
the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn 't all that far off .
i mean , from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on cambodia than in all of world war ii japan , including the two nuclear bombs of august 1945 .
the khmer rouge didn 't believe in money .
so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed .
but not just that , they actually banned money .
i think it 's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it didn 't actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
my family was moved from phnom penh to pursat province .
this is a picture of what pursat looks like .
it 's actually a very pretty area of cambodia , where rice growing takes place .
and in fact they were forced to work the fields .
so my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp , labor camp .
and it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to vietnam .
and she spoke some vietnamese , as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends .
and she decided , despite the advice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive ,
because at this point they 're forcing everybody to work .
and they 're giving about -- in a modern-day , caloric-restriction diet , i guess -- they 're giving porridge , with a few grains of rice .
and at about this time actually my father got very sick .
and he didn 't speak vietnamese .
so he died actually , in january 1976 .
and it made it possible , in fact , for us to take on this plan .
so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev ,
which is across from the border from vietnam .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
and my mother 's vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she 'd given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
but she 'd given the boys girls ' names , and the girls boys ' names .
and it wasn 't until she met a vietnamese lady who told her this , and then tutored her for two days intensively , that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know , this was a moment of truth .
if she fails , we 're all headed to the gallows ;
if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .
and she actually , of course -- i 'm here , she passes .
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .
and then onwards to chau doc .
and this is a picture of hong ngu , vietnam today .
a pretty idyllic place on the mekong delta .
but for us it meant freedom .
and freedom from persecution from the khmer rouge .
last year , the khmer rouge tribunal , which the u.n. is helping cambodia take on , started , and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal about my father 's passing away .
and i got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal .
and it 's for me a matter of justice for history , and accountability for the future ,
because cambodia remains a pretty lawless place , at times .
five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc .
and she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom , but also fear , because we had just come out of cambodia .
i 'm happy , actually , today , to present her .
she 's here today with us in the audience .
thank you mother .

when jungian analyst inge missmahl visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair , trauma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychiatrists . missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country 's system of psychosocial counseling , promoting both individual and , perhaps , national healing .

inge missmahl brings peace to the minds of afghanistan
so i want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story -- about addressing desperation , depression and despair in afghanistan , and what we have learned from it , and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead -- in the future -- and how to participate again in everyday life .
so , i am a jungian psychoanalyst , and i went to afghanistan in january 2004 , by chance , on an assignment for medica mondiale .
jung in afghanistan -- you get the picture .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
you may know this from the media ,
but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and -- i repeat myself -- in 30 years of war .
so this translates into ongoing violence , foreign interests , bribery , drugs , ethnic conflicts , bad health , shame , fear and cumulative traumatic experiences .
local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations .
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation worsens every day -- either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago .
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
yet , there is hope .
one day a man told me , " my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . "
this is a picture i took in 2005 , walking on fridays over the hills in kabul ,
and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation .
so , doctors prescribe medication .
and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads .
military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
why ?
because people don 't have tools to cope with it , to get over it .
so , soon after my arrival , i had confirmed something which i had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
however , what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
after a counseling session , a woman said to me , " because you have felt me , i can feel myself again , and i want to participate again in my family life . "
this was very important , because the family is central in afghans ' social system .
no one can survive alone .
and if people feel used , worthless and ashamed , because something horrible has happened to them , then they retreat , and they fall into social isolation , and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones , because they do not want to burden them .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks -- so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly , suddenly , and they cannot control it .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
so , husbands start beating wives , mothers and fathers beat their children , and afterward , they feel awful .
they did not want to do this , it just happened --
they lost control .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
and partly this is already happening .
so everybody needs a sense for the future ,
and the afghan sense of the future is shattered .
but let me repeat the words of the woman . " because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . "
so the key here is empathy .
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .
somebody has to feel how you felt .
and somebody has to see you and listen to you .
everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true ,
and this only goes with another person .
so everybody must be able to say , " this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i 'm able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it .
and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children , and i will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter , " -- what happens too often in afghanistan .
so something can be done , even in such extreme environments as afghanistan .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
but , of course , i needed help and funds .
and one evening , i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul , and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan .
and i explained to him quickly , i would train psycho-social counselors , i would open centers , and i explained to him why .
this man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said , " if you want to do this , call me . "
at that time , it was the head of caritas germany .
so , i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany , and we trained 30 afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul .
this was our sign -- it 's hand-painted ,
and we had 45 all over kabul .
eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
this was a very exciting time , developing this with my wonderful afghan team .
and they are working with me up to today .
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
so , from 2008 up until today , a substantial change and step forward has been taking place .
the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health , to lobby this approach --
we succeeded .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
this means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces , and you are the first to see the results .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe .
and the red line is the treatment as usual -- medication with a medical doctor .
and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
and the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only , without medication .
and you can see the symptoms almost completely go away , and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly , which is explicable , because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses , but you can learn how to cope with them .
so this makes us very happy , because now we also have some evidence that this is working .
so here you see , this is a health facility in northern afghanistan , and every morning it looks like this all over .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients ,
but now this will change .
they go to the clinics , because they want to cure their immediate symptoms , and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions , develop their resources , learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future .
and i would like to share one short vignette .
one hazara said to his pashtun counselor , " if we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . "
and another counselor said to me after the training , " you know , i never knew why i survived the killings in my village ,
but now i know , because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan . "
so i believe this kept me running .
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .
and also -- i think -- without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we cannot build-up civil societies .
i thought it was an idea worth spreading , and i think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere .
i thank you for your attention .

jose abreu on kids transformed by music
chris anderson : let 's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago .
jose antonio abreu : my dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , i am overjoyed today at being awarded the ted prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in venezuela the national system of youth and children 's orchestras and choirs .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician ,
and , thank god , i made it .
from my teachers , my family and my community , i had all the necessary support to become a musician .
all my life i 've dreamed that all venezuelan children have the same opportunity that i had .
from that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country .
from the very first rehearsal , i saw the bright future ahead .
because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me .
i had received a donation of 50 music stands to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal .
when i arrived at the rehearsal , only 11 kids had shown up , and i said to myself , " do i close the program or multiply these kids ? "
i decided to face the challenge , and on that same night , i promised those 11 children i 'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world .
two months ago , i remembered that promise i made , when a distinguished english critic published an article in the london times , asking who could be the winner of the orchestra world cup .
he mentioned four great world orchestras , and the fifth one was venezuela 's youth symphony orchestra .
today we can say that art in latin america is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right , a right for all the people .
child : there is no difference here between classes , nor white or black , nor if you have money or not .
simply , if you are talented , if you have the vocation and the will to be here , you get in . you share with us and make music .
ja : during the recent tour by the simon bolivar youth orchestra of venezuela of u.s. and europe , we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls , how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians , how the standing ovations , sometimes 30 minutes long , seemed to last forever , and how the public , after the concert was over , went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph .
this meant not only an artistic triumph , but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of latin america , as seen in venezuela , giving these audiences a message of music , vitality , energy , enthusiasm and strength .
in its essence , the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures . they are examples and schools of social life , because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence , following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence
of voices and instruments .
that 's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them , develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values
related to the music in all its senses .
this is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility , in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters
to teach other kids .
child : after all this time here , music is life . nothing else .
music is life .
ja : each teenager and child in el sistema has his own story , and they are all important and of great significance to me .
let me mention the case of edicson ruiz .
he is a boy from a parish in caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the san agustin 's junior orchestra .
with his effort , and the support of his mother , his family and his community , he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the berlin philharmonic orchestra .
we have another well-known case -- gustavo dudamel .
he started as a boy member of the children 's orchestra in his hometown , barquisimeto .
there , he grew as a violinist and as a conductor .
he became the conductor of venezuela 's junior orchestras , and today conducts the world 's greatest orchestras .
he is the musical director of los angeles philharmonic , and is still the overall leader of venezuela 's junior orchestras .
he was the conductor of the gothenburg symphony orchestra , and he 's an unbeatable example for young musicians in latin america and the world .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
it 's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever , but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups .
the effect of el sistema is felt in three fundamental circles : in the personal / social circle ,
in the family circle and in the community .
in the personal / social circle , the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side .
the music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being , thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality .
so , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge -- the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
all this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence .
mother teresa of calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me : the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof , but the feeling of being no-one -- the feeling of not being anyone , the lack of identification , the lack of public esteem .
that 's why the child 's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community .
it makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility , perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school .
within the family , the parents ' support is unconditional .
the child becomes a role model for both his parents , and this is very important for a poor child .
once the child discovers he is important to his family , he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community .
also , he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family .
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .
the large majority of our children belong , as i already mentioned , to the most vulnerable strata of the venezuelan population .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities
that music has to offer .
finally , in the circle of the community , the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings .
the spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society .
it 's what makes a child play a violin at home , while his father works in his carpentry .
it 's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home , while her mother does the housework .
the idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs
that their children belong to .
the huge spiritual world that music produces in itself , which also lies within itself , ends up overcoming material poverty .
from the minute a child 's taught how to play an instrument , he 's no longer poor . he becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level , who 'll later become a full citizen .
needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution , violence , bad habits , and everything degrading in the life of a child .
a few years ago , historian arnold toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis .
not an economic or social crisis , but a spiritual one .
i believe that to confront such a crisis , only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity , to mankind 's deepest aspirations , and to the historic demands of our times .
education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect , more aware , more noble and more just society .
with passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to ted for its outstanding humanism , the scope of its principles , for its open and generous promotion of young values .
we hope that ted can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music , in which the social , communal , spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission .
no longer putting society at the service of art , and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite , but instead art at the service of society , at the service of the weakest , at the service of the children , at the service of the sick , at the service of the vulnerable , and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity .
ca : we are going live now to caracas . we are going live to caracas to hear maestro abreu 's ted prize wish .
ja : here is my ted prize wish : i wish that you 'll help to create and document a special training program for 50 gifted young musicians , passionate about their art and social justice , and dedicated to bringing el sistema to the united states
and other countries .
thank you very much .

nicholas negroponte , in 1984 , makes 5 predictions
in this rather long sort of marathon presentation , i 've tried to break it up into three parts : the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface .
and these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of , if you will , the intelligence of interaction .
then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies -- new media falling very much into that mold .
again , i will go through them as fast as possible .
and then the last one will be some examples i 've been able to collect , which i think illustrate this at least as best i can , in the world of entertainment .
people have this belief -- and i share most of it -- that we will be using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future . but then you think , " my god ! what a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on tv . "
well , it doesn 't have to be terrible .
and that is a slide taken from a tv set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
well , what 's happened ? how did people get into this mess ?
where you are now , all of a sudden , sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems , and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen ?
well , you have to remember that tv was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal .
so you get a 13-inch , 19-inch , whatever , tv ,
and then you should multiply that by eight and that 's the distance you should sit away from the tv set .
now we 've put people 18 inches in front of a tv , and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen , all of a sudden , are staring you in the face : the shadow mask , the scan lines , all of that .
and they can be treated very easily ;
there are actually ways of getting rid of them ,
there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures .
i 'm talking here a little bit about display technologies .
let me talk about how you might input information .
and my favorite example is always fingers . i 'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays . high-tech , high-touch . isn 't that what some of you said ?
it 's certainly a very important medium for input ,
and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display .
in fact , they 're not : it 's really a very , very high-resolution input medium --
you have to just do it twice , you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly --
and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .
and so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution , it 's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing .
but it , in some sense , misses the point : namely , that fingers are a very , very high-resolution input medium .
now , what are some of the other advantages ?
well , the one advantage is that you don 't have to pick them up ,
and people don 't realize how important that is -- not having to pick up your fingers to use them .
when you think for a second of the mouse on macintosh -- and i will not criticize the mouse too much -- when you 're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something -- first of all , you 've got to find the mouse .
you have to probably stop . maybe not come to a grinding halt , but you 've got to sort of find that mouse . then you find the mouse , and you 're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen .
and then when you finally see where it is , then you 've got to move it to get the cursor over there , and then -- " bang " -- you 've got to hit a button or do whatever .
that 's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion -- or one-and-a-half , depending on how you want to count .
again , what i 'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that i think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface .
and another advantage , of course , of using fingers is you have 10 of them .
and we have never known how to do this technically ,
so this slide is a fake slide .
we never succeeded in using ten fingers , but there are certain things you can do , obviously , with more than one-finger input , which is rather fascinating .
what we did stumble across was something ... again , which is typical of the computer field , is when you have a bug that you can 't get rid of you turn it into a feature .
and maybe ... maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug .
but the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays :
we wanted to be able to draw -- you know , rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points --
and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass -- if glass was the substrate , which it usually is .
so we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display .
and when you touch it with your finger , you can actually , then , introduce all the forces on the face of that screen , and that actually has a certain amount of value .
let me see if i can load another disc and show you , quickly , an example .
now , imagine a screen , which is not only touch-sensitive now , it 's pressure-sensitive .
and it 's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen -- x , y , and z at least in one direction ; we couldn 't figure out how to come in the other direction .
but let me get rid of the slide ,
and let 's see if this comes on .
ok . so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation .
the person 's just , if you will , pushing on the screen to make a curve .
but this is the interesting part .
i want to stop it for a second because the movie is very badly made .
and the particular display was built about six years ago , and when we moved from one room to another room , a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed .
so all we have is this record .
but imagine that screen having lots of objects on it
and the person has touched an object -- one of n -- like he did there , and then pushed on it .
now , imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light :
one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass .
and when you touch it , you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen ,
and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen .
and what you can do -- oops , i didn 't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .
so again , they don 't have to be weight ;
they could be a general trying to move troops , and he 's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat .
in fact , they funded it for that very reason .
the whole notion , then , is one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer -- in this case it 's pressure and touches -- that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn 't be presented before .
i want to move on to another example , which is one of a different sort , where we 're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book .
here , the idea is that you 're going to take this book , if you will , and it 's going to come alive .
you 're going to sort of breathe life into it .
we are so used to doing monologues .
filmmakers , for example , are the experts in monologue making :
you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning , middle and end ,
and in some sense the art of it is that .
and you then say , " there 's an opportunity for making conversational movies . " well , what does that mean ?
and it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium .
so , book writing is the same thing .
what i 'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there , but you have to keep a few things in mind .
one is that this book knows about itself .
each frame of the movie has information about itself .
so it knows , or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself . it 's just not a static movie frame .
that 's one thing . the other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium , and you can , in fact , branch and expand and elaborate and shrink .
and here -- again , my favorite example -- is the cookbook , the " larousse gastronomique . "
and i think i use the example all too often , but it 's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin , and you get to the end of the recipe and it says , " cook until done . "
now , that would be , if you will , the top green track , which doesn 't mean too much . but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn 't an expert , and say , " cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes . "
and then for a real beginner , you would go down even further and elaborate more -- say , " open the oven , preheat , wait for the light to go out , open the door , don 't leave it open too long , put the penguin in and shut the door ... " whatever .
and that 's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back .
that 's one kind of use of random access . and the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways .
if you 're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question , the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .
you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing , or if you know the particular student and that student 's cognitive style , then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student .
there are all sorts of techniques you will use -- and again , this is a different kind of branching .
so , what i will show you is ... it 's a rather boring book , but i 'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren 't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment . and this is a book on how to repair a transmission .
now , i don 't even know what vintage the transmission is , but let me just show you very quickly some of it , and we 'll move on .
nicholas negroponte : now , this is his table of contents .
just a picture of the transmission , and as you rub your finger across the transmission
it highlights the various parts .
narrator : when i find a chapter that i want to see , i just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read .
the words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words , so i can get a different definition by just touching the word , and the definition appears , superimposed over the illustration .
nn : this is about the oil pan , or the oil filter and all that .
this is relatively important because it sets the page ... narrator : this is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red .
i can get a definition of these words just by touching them , and the definition will appear in the illustration corner .
i can get back to the illustration , but in this case it 's not a single frame ,
but it 's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that 's described in the text .
the two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
and the movie is displayed as a full frame movie .
i can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed .
here 's another step-by-step procedure , only in this case -- nn : okay , this movie is ... everybody 's heard of sound-sync movies --
this is text-sync movies , so as the movie plays , the text gets highlighted . we highlight the text as we go through the movie .
repairman : ... not too far out . front poles , preferably .
don 't loosen them too far . if you loosen them too far , you 'll have a big mess .
nn : i suspect that some of you might not even understand that language .
ok . i 'm at the third and last part of this , which i said i would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment .
and of course , good education has got to be good entertainment ,
so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we 've been doing -- in this case , in senegal -- where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium . but not as teaching machines at all ;
the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles --
the child is , if you will , the teacher and the machine is the student --
and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking .
but teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant .
and there are just a few slides i want to go through , but there 's a story i 'd like to tell . and that was when , before we did this in any developing countries -- we 're doing it , in fact , in three developing countries right now : pakistan , colombia and senegal --
we did it in some pretty rough areas of new york city .
and one child , whose name i 've forgotten , was about seven or eight years old , absolutely considered mentally handicapped -- couldn 't read , didn 't even make it in the lowest section of the school 's classes --
and was pretty much not in school , though physically there .
but did hang around the , quote , " computer room , " where there were quite a few computers , and learned this particular language called logo --
and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun ,
it was very interesting . and one day , by chance , some visitors from the nie came by in their double-breasted suits looking at this setup , and none of the children who were normally there , except for this one child , were there .
he was , and he said , " let me show you how this works , "
and they got an absolutely ingenuous , wonderful description of logo .
and the child was just zipping right through it , showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn 't explain
and so he flipped through the manual , found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked .
they were delighted , and by the time it was time to go see the principal , whom they 'd actually come to see -- not the computer room -- they went upstairs and they said , " this is absolutely remarkable !
that child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn 't do automatically with that manual . it was just absolutely fantastic . "
the principal said , " there 's a dreadful mistake , because that child can 't read .
and you obviously have been hoodwinked or you 've talked about somebody else . "
and they all got up and they all went downstairs
and the child was still there . and they did something very intelligent : they asked the child , " can you read ? "
and the child said , " no , i can 't . "
and then they said , " but wait a minute . you just looked through that manual and you found ... " and he said , " oh , but that 's not reading . "
and so they said , " well , what 's reading then ? "
he says , " well , reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .
it 's absolutely irrelevant , and i get nothing for it .
but here , with a little bit of effort i get a lot of return . "
and it really meant something to the child .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
and that story has many other anecdotes that are similar , but wow . the key to the future of computers in education is right there ,
and it is : when does it mean something to a child ?
there is a myth , and it truly is a myth : we believe -- and i 'm sure a lot of you believe in this room -- that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak .
and it 's not , but we think speech -- " my god , little children pick it up somehow ,
and by the age of two they 're doing a mediocre job ,
and by three and four they 're speaking reasonably well .
and yet you 've got to go to school to learn how to read ,
and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you . hence , it must be harder . " well , it 's not harder .
what the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child ;
the child can get a great deal by talking to you .
reading and writing is utterly useless .
there is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith , and that it 's going to help you .
so what happens is you go to school and people say , " just believe me , you 're going to like it .
you 're going to like reading , " and just read and read .
on the other hand , you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer
and they type a little command and -- poof ! -- something happens .
and all of a sudden ... you may not call that reading and writing , but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen has a huge payoff , and it 's a lot of fun .
and in fact , it 's a powerful educational instrument .
well , in senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom : 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher , a little bit of chalk .
this student was one of our first students , and it 's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard ,
and she came ... within two days -- i want to show you the program she wrote , and remember her hairstyle . and that is the program she made .
that 's what meant something to her , is doing the hair pattern , and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was , to her , absolutely the most meaningful piece ...
but rooted in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest .
and again , i could talk for three hours about this subject .
i will come to my last example and then quit .
and my last example -- as some of my former colleagues , whom i see in the room , can imagine what it will be .
yes , it is . it 's our work -- that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing .
and the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation : you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --
and you had to have these people in teleconference , such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
and the fact that we knew the people -- we had to take a page out of the history of walt disney --
we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people 's faces .
so if i wanted to call my friend peter sprague on the phone , my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk ,
and that would be the tv used for the occasion .
and it 's uncanny : there 's no way i can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face projected on a 3d crt of that sort .
the next thing that we had to do is to persuade them that there needed to be spatial correspondence , which is straightforward , but again , it 's something that didn 't fall naturally out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking ;
it was a very , if you will , architectural or spatial concept . and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table , the actual location of the people becomes rather important .
and when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say , " he or she wouldn 't agree , "
and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial .
so we said , " well , these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same ,
so that at my site , i would be , if you will , real
and then at each other 's site you 'd have these plastic heads .
and the plastic heads , sometimes you want to project them . and there are a number of schemes , which i don 't want to dwell on ,
but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person .
and i 'll show you one more slide , where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen .
now , we track , on the person 's head , the head motions --
so we transmit with a video the head positions --
and so this head moves in about two axes .
so if i , all of a sudden , turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person , then at the person to my right 's site , he 'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .
and then if that person interrupts , then those two heads may turn .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / eric _ dishman _ take _ health _ care _ off _ the _ mainframe.html
at tedmed , eric dishman makes a bold argument : the us health care system is like computing circa 1959 , tethered to big , unwieldy central systems : hospitals , doctors , nursing homes . as our aging population booms , it 's imperative , he says , to create personal , networked , home-based health care for all .

eric dishman : take health care off the mainframe
if you think about the phone -- and intel has tested a lot of the things i 'm going to show you , over the last 10 years , in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in ireland , and 300 in portland -- trying to understand : how do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way ?
and if you think about the phone , right , it 's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time .
we 're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .
and a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it 's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take , and they fake like they 're having a conversation with a friend .
and they 're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that 's ugly , that sits on their kitchen table and says , " i 'm old . i 'm frail . "
it 's surreptitious technology that 's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
now , we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
think about it , all right ? i 'm going to answer the phone three different times .
" hello ? hey . "
all right ? that 's the first time .
" hello ? uh , hey . "
" hello ? uh , who ?
oh , hey . "
all right ? very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times .
and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time , down to the tenths of a microsecond , that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately , or they do a lot of what 's called trouble talk , where they 're like , " wait , who is this ? oh . " right ?
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
we call these behavioral markers .
there 's lots of others . is the person going to the phone as quickly , when it rings , as they used to ?
is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem ?
has their voice gotten more quiet ? we 're doing a lot of work with people with alzheimer 's and particularly with parkinson 's ,
where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with parkinson 's patients may be the best early indicator of parkinson 's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
so , sensors are looking at that kind of voice .
when you pick up the phone , how much tremor are you having , and what is that like , and what is that trend like over a period of time ?
are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to ?
is it a dexterity problem ? is it the onset of arthritis ?
are you using the phone ? are you socializing less than you used to ?
and looking at that pattern . and what does that decline in social health mean , as a kind of a vital sign of the future ?
and then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .
wow , what a great day that will be once we 're allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
so , these are what i would call behavioral markers .
and it 's the whole field that we 've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at intel .
how do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that i 'm going to talk about in this talk ?
behavioral markers matter .
how do we change behavior ?
how do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that 's going to help us with prevention of disease , early onset of disease , and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time ?
now , why would intel let me spend a lot of time and money , over the last 10 years , trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers ?
this is some of the field work that we 've done .
we have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
we study people in rochester , new york .
we go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter , and their access to healthcare , and how much they socialize , is very different than in the summer .
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
if they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well .
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
why is intel willing to fund that ?
it 's because of the second slogan that i want to talk about . ten years ago , when i started trying to convince intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living , this is what i called it : " y2k + 10 . " you know , back in 2000 , we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers , and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000 , that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to .
it was right around new years .
and that switchover , when we had the larger number of older people on the planet , for the first time than younger people .
for the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic , that 's the expectation from demographers , going forward .
and 10 years ago it seemed like i had a lot of time to convince intel to work on this . right ?
y2k + 10 was coming , the baby boomers starting to retire .
well folks , it 's like we know these demographics here .
this is a map of the entire world . it 's like the lights are on , but nobody 's home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
i mean we sort of get it here , but we don 't get it here ,
and we 're not doing anything about it .
the health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that 's coming , and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care , but deliver care in some radically different ways .
and in fact , it 's upon us .
i mean you probably saw these headlines . this is catherine casey who is the first boomer to actually get social security .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
she was born one second after midnight in 1946 .
a retired school teacher ,
there she is with a social security administrator .
the first boomer actually , we didn 't even wait till 2011 , next year .
we 're already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
all right , so it 's here . this y2k + 10 problem is at our door .
this is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,
but somehow we can 't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it . we 'll wait until it 's more of a catastrophe , and react , as opposed to prepare for it .
so , one of the reasons it 's so challenging to prepare for this y2k problem is , i want to argue , we have what i would call mainframe poisoning .
andy grove , about six or seven years ago , he doesn 't even know or remember this , in a fortune magazine article he used the phrase " mainframe healthcare , " and i 've been extending and expanding this .
he saw it written down somewhere . he 's like , " eric that 's a really cool concept . "
i was like , " actually it was your idea . you said it in a fortune magazine article .
i just extended it . "
you know , this is the mainframe .
this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large , expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .
this is the first general hospital in vienna .
and actually the second general hospital in vienna , in about 1850 , was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties .
and it 's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body , and divided care into departments and compartments .
and it was reflected in our architecture ,
it was reflected in the way that we taught students ,
and this mainframe mentality persists today .
now , i 'm not anti-hospital .
with my own healthcare problems , i 've taken drug therapies , i 've traveled to this hospital and others , many , many times .
but we worship the high hospital on a hill . right ?
and this is mainframe healthcare .
and just as 30 years ago we couldn 't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we 're carrying around in our cell phone today ,
and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --
that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
we are obsessed with this way of thinking .
when intel does surveys all around the world and we say , " quick response : healthcare . " the first word that comes up is " doctor . "
the second that comes up is " hospital . " and the third is " illness " or " sickness . " right ?
we are wired , in our imagination , to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place .
our entire health reform discussion right now , health i.t. , when we talk with policy makers , equals " how are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? "
we 're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home .
and the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare . right ?
this is a very reactive , crisis-driven system .
we 're doing 15-minute exams with patients .
it 's population-based .
we collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting ,
and we fix them up , like humpty-dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope -- we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don 't come back into the mainframe .
and the problem is we can 't afford it today , folks .
we can 't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured .
and now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through ?
business as usual in healthcare is broken and we 've got to do something different .
we 've got to focus on the home .
we 've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home . how do we be more proactive , prevention-driven ?
how do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7 ?
how do we get a personal baseline about what 's going to work for you ?
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data , psychological data , relational data , in and on and around the home ?
and how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that 's around us to change our behavior ?
that 's what we need to do for our personal health model .
i want to give you a couple of examples . this is mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s , had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls .
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
classic . hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior .
this is what was happening to mimi ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility .
she tripped over her oxygen tank .
many people in this generation won 't press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don 't want to bother anybody , even though they 've been paying 30 dollars a month .
boomers will press the button . trust me .
they 're going to be pressing that button non-stop . right ?
mimi broke her pelvis , lay all night , all morning , finally somebody came in and found her , sent her to the hospital .
they fixed her back up . she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living . they put her into the nursing home unit .
first night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis ,
sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
now , the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife 's grandmother .
now , i 'm eric dishman . i speak english ,
i work for intel , i make a good salary ,
i 'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --
it 's an area of research that i work on .
i have access to senators and ceos .
i can 't stop this from happening .
what happens if you don 't have money , you don 't speak english or don 't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur ?
how do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place ?
let me give you a quick example of work that we 're doing to try to do exactly that .
i 've been wearing a little technology that we call shimmer .
it 's a research platform .
it has accelerometry . you can plug in a three-lead ecg .
there is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
the problem is , our understanding of falls today , like mimi , is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell ,
from the state , saying , " what were you doing when you fell ? "
that 's sort of the state of the art .
but with something like shimmer , or we have something called the magic carpet , embedded sensors in carpet , or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine , we 're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand : what are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls ?
and most often we can do two interventions , fix the meds mix .
i 'm a qualitative researcher , but when i look at these data streams coming in from these homes , i can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the household . right ?
these discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we 've actually never done before .
this is an example in our tril clinic in ireland of -- actually what you 're seeing is she 's looking at data , in this picture , from the magic carpet .
so , we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway , and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months .
here 's what some of this data might look like .
this is actually sensor firings .
these are two different subjects in our study .
it 's about a year 's worth of data .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
this person on the left is living in their own home .
this person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility .
i know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here . right ?
now , this doesn 't mean that much to you .
but when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we 're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we 've never understood before .
you can go to orcatech.org -- it has nothing to do with whales , it 's the oregon center for aging and technology --
to see more about that .
the problem is , intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research .
i 'm not bragging about how much we fund ; it 's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging , chronic disease management and independent living in the home .
so , my mantra here , my fourth slogan is : 10,000 households or bust .
we need to drive a national , if not international , framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies , where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband , full medical characterization , and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund , to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies .
so , 10,000 households or bust .
these are just some of the households that we 've done in the intel studies .
my fifth and final phrase : i have tried for two years , and there were moments when we were quite close , to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something ,
from a mainframe model to a personal health model , or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we 're going to finance .
it doesn 't matter how we finance healthcare .
we 're going to figure something out for the next 10 years , and try it .
no matter who pays for it , we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams
and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways .
the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , " our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years . "
it 's achievable . we should do it economically ,
we should do it morally ,
and we should do it for quality of life .
but there is no goal within this health reform .
it 's just a mess today .
so , you know , that 's my last message to you .
how do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the y2k + 10 problem that 's coming ?
it 's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all , but it 's going to be part of the solution .
and if we don 't create a personal health movement , something that we 're all aiming towards in reform , then we 're going to move nowhere .
so , i hope you 'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
thanks very much .

tristram stuart : the global food waste scandal
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old .
i bought some pigs . i was living in sussex .
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way .
i went to my school kitchen , and i said , " give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . " i went to the local baker and took their stale bread .
i went to the local greengrocer , and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets .
this was great . my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . i sold that pork to my school friends ' parents , and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance .
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption , and that i was only scratching the surface , and that right the way up the food supply chain , in supermarkets , greengrocers , bakers , in our homes , in factories and farms , we were hemorrhaging out food .
supermarkets didn 't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting .
i 'd been round the back . i 'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites , and i thought , surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it .
one morning , when i was feeding my pigs , i noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time .
i grabbed hold of it , sat down , and ate my breakfast with my pigs .
that was the first act of what i later learned to call freeganism , really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste , and the provision of the solution to food waste , which is simply to sit down and eat food , rather than throwing it away .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we 're talking about food being thrown away , we 're not talking about rotten stuff , we 're not talking about stuff that 's beyond the pale .
we 're talking about good , fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale .
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem
on a global scale . what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don 't exist ,
and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
that 's based on diet intake surveys , it 's based on levels of obesity , it 's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people 's mouths .
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste .
there will always be waste . i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste-free world .
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good , stable , secure , nutritional diet for every person in that country .
any dot above that line , and you 'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country .
as a country gets richer , it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants , and as you can see , most european and north american countries fall between 150 and 200 percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations .
so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people .
but the thing that really struck me , when i plotted all this data , and it was a lot of numbers , was that you can see how it levels off .
countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark , and then they level off , and they don 't really go on rising as you might expect .
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false .
and that 's what i came up with .
if you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants , but also the food that people feed to livestock , the maize , the soy , the wheat , that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products , what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 2050 , i always think of these graphs .
the fact is , we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger .
we 've never had such gargantuan surpluses before .
in many ways , this is a great success story of human civilization , of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago .
it is a success story . it has been a success story .
but what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear , and when we chop down forests , as we are every day , to grow more and more food , when we extract water from depleting water reserves , when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food , and then we throw away so much of it , we have to think about what we can start saving .
and yesterday , i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to inspect , if you like , what they 're throwing away .
i found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there .
and i thought , well this could serve as a symbol for today .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply ,
okay ? we start out with nine .
that 's what 's in fields around the world every single year .
the first biscuit we 're going to lose before we even leave the farm .
that 's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture , whether it 's a lack of infrastructure , refrigeration , pasteurization , grain stores , even basic fruit crates , which means
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields .
the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock , the maize , the wheat and the soya .
unfortunately , our beasts are inefficient animals , and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat ,
so we 've lost those two , and we 've only kept this one in meat and dairy products .
two more we 're going to throw away directly into bins .
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste , what ends up in the garbage , what ends up in supermarket bins , what ends up in restaurant bins . we 've lost another two , and we 've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on .
that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources , especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up .
where does it end up ? we 're used to seeing the stuff
on our plates , but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between ?
supermarkets are an easy place to start .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn 't need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what 's inside .
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in britain , in europe , in north america .
it represents a colossal waste of food , but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg .
when you start going up the supply chain , you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale .
can i have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house ?
who lives in a household where that crust -- that slice at the first and last end of each loaf -- who lives in a household where it does get eaten ?
okay , most people , not everyone , but most people , and this is , i 'm glad to say , what i see across the world ,
and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it ?
i certainly haven 't .
so i kept on thinking , where do those crusts go ?
this is the answer , unfortunately : 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day , day-fresh bread .
in the same year that i visited this factory , i went to pakistan , where people in 2008 were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies .
we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in britain and elsewhere in the world . we take food
off the market shelves that hungry people depend on .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it .
potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect , all going for pigs .
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications , tomatoes in tenerife , oranges in florida , bananas in ecuador , where i visited last year , all being discarded . this is one day 's waste from one banana plantation in ecuador .
all being discarded , perfectly edible , because they 're the wrong shape or size .
if we do that to fruit and vegetables , you bet we can do it to animals too .
liver , lungs , heads , tails , kidneys , testicles , all of these things which are traditional , delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste . offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last 30 years .
as a result , this stuff gets fed to dogs at best , or is incinerated .
this man , in kashgar , xinjiang province , in western china , is serving up his national dish .
it 's called sheep 's organs .
it 's delicious , it 's nutritious , and as i learned when i went to kashgar , it symbolizes their taboo against food waste .
i was sitting in a roadside cafe .
a chef came to talk to me , i finished my bowl , and halfway through the conversation , he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl .
i thought , " my goodness , what taboo have i broken ?
how have i insulted my host ? " he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl , and he said , " clean . " i thought , " my god , you know , i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food .
this guy has thrashed me at my own game . " but it gave me faith . it gave me faith that we , the people , do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale , if we make noise about it , tell corporations about it , tell governments we want to see an end to food waste , we do have the power to bring about that change .
fish , 40 to 60 percent of european fish are discarded at sea , they don 't even get landed .
in our homes , we 've lost touch with food .
this is an experiment i did on three lettuces .
who keeps lettuces in their fridge ?
most people . the one on the left
was kept in a fridge for 10 days .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
the one on the right i treated like cut flowers .
it 's a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
some food waste , as i said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
i answered that question when i was 15 .
in fact , humans answered that question 6,000 years ago : we domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food .
and yet , in europe , that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
it 's unscientific . it 's unnecessary .
if you cook food for pigs , just as if you cook food for humans , it is rendered safe .
it 's also a massive saving of resources .
at the moment , europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america , where its production contributes to global warming , to deforestation , to biodiversity loss , to feed livestock here in europe .
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
if we did that , and fed it to pigs , we would save that amount of carbon .
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste , to anaerobic digestion , which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity , you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste . it 's much better to feed it to pigs .
we knew that during the war .
a silver lining : it has kicked off globally , the quest to tackle food waste .
feeding the 5,000 is an event i first organized in 2009 .
we fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted .
since then , it 's happened again in london , it 's happening internationally , and across the country .
it 's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food , to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it , and to stop wasting it .
for the sake of the planet we live on , for the sake of our children , for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us , we are a terrestrial animal , and we depend on our land
for food . at the moment , we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats .
stop wasting food . thank you very much .

renowned paleontologist jack horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur . he 's found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues , but never intact dna . so , in a new approach , he 's taking living descendants of the dinosaur and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits - including teeth , tails , and even hands - to make a " chickenosaurus .

jack horner : building a dinosaur from a chicken
when i was growing up in montana , i had two dreams .
i wanted to be a paleontologist , a dinosaur paleontologist , and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur .
and so that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life .
i was very fortunate early in my career .
i was fortunate in finding things .
i wasn 't very good at reading things .
in fact , i don 't read much of anything .
i am extremely dyslexic , and so reading is the hardest thing i do .
but instead , i go out and i find things .
then i just pick things up .
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
and i wander about the hills ,
and i have found a few things .
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests , the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones .
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big , stupid , green reptiles that people had thought for so many years .
people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special .
and so , at that time , i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .
we were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young , brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults .
the appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .
in social groups of animals , the juveniles always look different than the adults .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and so we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like .
and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around .
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton .
and in his book , he talked about the social animals .
and then steven spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of " jurassic park . "
michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life .
you all know the story , right .
i mean , i assume everyone here has seen " jurassic park . "
if you want to make a dinosaur , you go out , you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it , good ones , and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna , because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out .
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that ,
and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur .
and everybody 's happy about that .
and they 're happy over and over again .
they keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
and then , then , then , and then ...
then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness ,
and they get together , and they conspire . and , of course , that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around . so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it , and you drilled into it , and you got something out of that insect , and you cloned it , and you did it over and over and over again , you 'd have a room full of mosquitoes .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
now if you want dinosaur dna , i say go to the dinosaur .
so that 's what we 've done .
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur ,
and we chose the dinosaur on the left , a tyrannosaurus rex , which was a very nice specimen . and one of my former doctoral students , dr. mary schweitzer , actually had the background to do this sort of thing .
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex , one of the thigh bones , and she actually found some very interesting structures in there .
they found these red circular-looking objects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
and they 're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
so she sampled some material out of it .
now it wasn 't dna ; she didn 't find dna .
but she did find heme , which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin .
and that was really cool .
that was interesting .
that was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme .
well we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it .
so a few years went by , and then we started the hell creek project .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
and out in eastern montana there 's a lot of space , a lot of badlands , and not very many people ,
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
we found a lot of tyrannosaurs , but we found one special tyrannosaur , and we called it b-rex .
and b-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock .
it wasn 't a very complete t. rex , and it wasn 't a very big t. rex , but it was a very special b-rex .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived , because we haven 't found the oldest one yet .
but this one died at the age of 16 .
we gave samples to mary schweitzer , and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when an animal is pregnant , when a bird is pregnant .
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs .
but mary went further .
she took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn 't be anything left .
but there was something left .
there were blood vessels left .
there were flexible , clear blood vessels .
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur .
it was extraordinary .
but she also found osteocytes , which are the cells that laid down the bones .
and try and try , we could not find dna , but she did find evidence of proteins .
but we thought maybe -- well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer , and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .
and we did . we got better material .
the cells looked better .
the vessels looked better .
found the protein collagen .
i mean , it was wonderful stuff .
but it 's not dinosaur dna .
so we have discovered that dinosaur dna , and all dna , just breaks down too fast .
we 're just not going to be able to do what they did in " jurassic park . "
we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur .
but birds are dinosaurs .
birds are living dinosaurs .
we actually classify them as dinosaurs .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them .
i know , you 're as bad as the sixth-graders .
the sixth-graders look at it and they say , " no . "
" you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool . "
" the chicken is not . "
so this is our problem , as you can imagine .
the chicken is a dinosaur .
i mean it really is .
you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way .
but the sixth-graders demand it .
" fix the chicken . "
so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken .
so we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
we 'll call them biological modification tools .
we have selection .
and we know selection works .
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .
i mean , that 's -- that 's definitely genetic modification .
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs .
we also have transgenesis .
transgenesis is really cool too .
that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .
that 's how people make glofish .
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish , and , puff , they glow .
and that 's pretty cool .
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and now they 're making glow-rabbits and glow-all-sorts-of-things .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth-graders either .
but there 's another thing .
there 's what we call atavism activation .
and atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic .
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails , and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic .
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
and here 's an example .
this is a chicken with teeth .
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens .
now that 's a good characteristic .
we can save that one .
we know we can use that .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
that 's getting closer .
that 's better than a glowing chicken .
a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university , is actually looking at atavisms .
and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop ,
and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail .
he 's also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
he 's looking for those genes as well .
and i said , " well , if you can find those , i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth-graders . "
and so he agreed .
and so that 's what we 're looking into .
if you look at dinosaur hands , a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it .
archaeopteryx , which is a bird , a primitive bird , still has that very primitive hand .
but as you can see , the pigeon , or a chicken or anything else , another bird , has kind of a weird-looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
it has the three fingers , the three digits .
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together .
and so what we 're looking for is that gene .
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
and the same goes for the tails .
birds have basically rudimentary tails .
and so we know that in embryo , as the animal is developing , it actually has a relatively long tail .
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
so that 's the other gene we 're looking for .
we want to stop that tail from resorbing .
so what we 're trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chickenosaurus .
it 's a cooler-looking chicken .
but it 's just the very basics .
so that really is what we 're doing .
and people always say , " why do that ?
why make this thing ?
what good is it ? "
well , that 's a good question .
actually , i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
anyway -- when our dino-chicken hatches , it will be , obviously , the poster child , or what you might call a poster chick , for technology , entertainment and design .
thank you .

there 's actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
and , in fact , everybody 's listed twice , because it 's sorted once by name and once by email address .
obviously a very small community .
there were only two other dannys on the internet then .
i knew them both .
we didn 't all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things .
so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days .
now , it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet .
so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com .
so i picked think.com , but then i thought , you know , there 's a lot of really interesting names out there .
maybe i should register a few extras just in case .
and then i thought , " nah , that wouldn 't be very nice . " that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn 't just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
so the basic idea of i.p. , or internet protocol , and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it , were fundamentally " from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . " and so , if you had some extra bandwidth , you 'd deliver a message for someone .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
you 'd kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet .
it was incredibly successful .
in fact , it was so successful that there 's no way that these days you could make a book like this .
my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
but , of course , you couldn 't do it , because we don 't know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses , and even if we did know their names , i 'm pretty sure that they would not want their name , address and telephone number published to everyone .
so the fact is that there 's a lot of bad guys on the internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making walled communities , secure subnetworks , vpns , little things that aren 't really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we 're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust .
and that means that it 's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad .
so , for instance , in all of asia recently , it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network .
they didn 't intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it .
now , you don 't really think that our airplane system depends on the internet , and in some sense it doesn 't .
i 'll come back to that later .
but the fact is that people couldn 't take off because something was going wrong on the internet , and the router card was down .
and so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
now , there was an interesting thing that happened last april .
all of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet , including a lot of the traffic between u.s. military installations , started getting re-routed through china .
so for a few hours , it all passed through china .
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they 're not going to do it with tanks .
that will not succeed .
what they 'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
there was basically a factory of industrial machines .
it didn 't think of itself as being on the internet .
it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centrifuges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant .
and so there 's a lot of -- i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers , about worries about cyber attacks and defenses against those .
but the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet , and there 's been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it 's actually kind of fragile .
so actually , in the early days , back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
so , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
everything started breaking .
the interesting thing was , though , that the sysadmins were able to fix it , but they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off .
now , of course you couldn 't do that today .
i mean , everything off , it 's like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
now , in fact , they couldn 't do it for a lot of reasons today .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you 're really not thinking you 're using the internet .
when you pump gas , you really don 't think you 're using the internet .
what 's happening increasingly , though , is these systems are beginning to use the internet .
most of them aren 't based on the internet yet , but they 're starting to use the internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the internet for the most part , internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions ,
and it 's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they 're cheap , they 're repeated , and so on .
so all of our systems , more and more , are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology .
and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
that 's crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
so we 've built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we 're using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it 's gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for .
and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now .
it 's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we 've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather , or something like that .
they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts don 't know exactly what 's going on .
so if you see one of these maps of the internet , it 's just somebody 's guess .
nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it 's different than it was an hour ago .
it 's constantly changing . it 's constantly reconfiguring .
and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that 's basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we 've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
and so right now , i think it 's literally true that we don 't know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the internet would be , and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year , and worse next year , and so on .
but so what we need is a plan b .
there is no plan b right now .
there 's no clear backup system that we 've very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
so what we need is something that doesn 't necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
this doesn 't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
it 's actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure .
it 's basically a matter of deciding to do it .
but people won 't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that 's the problem that we have right now .
so there 's been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it 's very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working so well .
so i think that , if people understand how much we 're starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , " yeah , i would like to use it , i 'd like to have such a system , " then it will get built .
it 's not that hard a problem .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
so i 'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it .
thank you very much .

charles fleischer insists : all things are moleeds
i am going to be talking about secrets .
obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it .
secrets . i 'm using powerpoint this year just because , you know , i 'm into the ted thing .
and when you use these things you don 't have to go like that .
you just press it .
oh , man . um , yes .
yes . i 'm sure ! just change it !
is bill gates here ?
change it ! come on ! what ?
ah ! okay .
that 's not my slides , but it 's okay .
as you can see , these are all maps .
and maps are important devices for transferring information , especially if you have human cognitive ability .
we can see that all formulas are really maps .
now , as humans , we make maps of places that we seldom even go ,
which seems a little wasteful of time .
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
there 're some very delightful names .
tranquilacalitis , [ unclear ] . my favorite is frigoris .
what are these people thinking ? frigoris ?
what the frigoris you doing ? names are important .
frigoris ? this is the moon . people could live there one day .
i 'll meet you at frigoris . no . i don 't think so .
there we see mars , again with various names .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronomical union .
this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects .
this is from their actual book .
these are some of the names that they have chosen , ladies and gentlemen .
i 'll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
that , of course , is the slavic swamp mermaid .
now i think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn 't really blend into the swamp feel .
" oh look ! mermaid come out of swamp . oh boy !
it 's time for bolotnitsa ! " djabran fluctus .
if that don 't flow off the tongue , what does ?
i mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word " fluctus " up there . that 's wrong .
one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life .
" it fluctus up , mama . "
hikuleo fluctus .
that 's a little more flowing . hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio 17 syllable thing .
and that 's the tonga underworld .
and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus , who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects , stars , and planets .
now , if you 're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn 't you relegate insects to somebody else ?
" no , no , really , i 'm so busy with the stars .
would you mind taking the insects ? thank you darling .
oh take the spiders too . i know they 're not insects , but i don 't care .
monkeys , chimps , just get rid of the hairy creatures . " now , we 're going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
so , you 'll be on mars , and you 're at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really " up " place .
yeah , i 'm at the depressio , and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
i go to chrysokeras .
left to the thymiamata .
then to niliacus lacus , which is not a bad name .
niliacus lacus , try to get the practice , slick-a-tick-a-bacus .
that 's a cool name . i will say that .
so , i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers .
and then of course arnon to thoth .
and of course there will be advertisements .
this is from their rule book , the international astronomical union .
and you know they 're international because they put it " en francais " as well .
l 'union astronomique internationale , for those of you who don 't speak french .
i thought i 'd translate for you .
from the rulebook : nomenclature is a tool .
the first consideration , make it clear , simple and unambiguous .
and i think that djabran fluctus , that fits that mode .
that 's simple , the goddess of goats , very simple .
djabran fluctus .
" now , frank is this clear to you , djabran fluctus ? "
" yeah , that 's the goat goddess right ? the abacazanian ?
it 's clear to me . "
" listen , i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid . can you call me in a little while ? "
also , from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest .
anyone can suggest changing a name .
so , i look to you , fellow member of the earth community .
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
so , these are actual names of people that work there .
i did some more investigation .
these are more people working for this group .
and , as you can see , they don 't use their first names .
these are people naming planets , and they won 't use their first names .
something is askew here .
is it because his name is really jupiter blunck ?
is that ganymede andromeda burba ?
is that mars ya marov ?
i don 't know . but it 's investigative material , no doubt .
there are some mapping people who do use their names .
witness please , eugene shoemaker , who , diligently , from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies .
must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house .
" mom , i want to make maps . "
" that 's wonderful eugene . you could make maps of toronto . "
" no , i want to make maps of planets . "
" yeah , go to your room . "
martians , venusians , jovians .
we have names for places where people don 't exist .
that seems a little silly to me .
there are no jovians .
getting back to my premise , i used stamps , by the way , because you don 't have to pay anybody for the rights .
there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat 's last theorem , and i 'm not sure whether that 's james coburn or richard harris .
it 's definitely one of the two . i 'm not really clear which one .
but obviously the point is that numbers are maps .
and within numbers , is there an underlying secret to the universe ?
that is the premise of this particular presentation .
by the way , that 's a natural picture of saturn , no adjustments . i mean that 's just beautiful .
so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet , and the day saturday , named after it , wonderfully .
so , formulas relate number to form .
that 's euler , his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool , not that funny , but it is cool .
he was also famous for having no body .
which a lot of you are like , " how did he figure that out ? "
he 's got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
here comes euler .
and that 's an icosahedron , which is one of the five sacred solids , very important shapes .
you see the icosahedron again .
the dodecahedron , it 's dual .
there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night .
the five sacred solids , as you can see there .
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
blue cheese , ranch , oil and vinegar , thousand islands and house .
i suggest the house .
the reality , now here is something important .
what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other .
and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
so , the whole concept of branes in the universe , if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be .
and that is , of course , what we are here to talk about .
what a coincidence !
october 9th , in france , jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
this would be a normal wave pattern .
but what they 're seeing , way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background , is this kind of odd undulation .
it doesn 't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like .
and judging from this , it looks a little like a cheeseburger .
so , i 'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger .
and for me , that 's a win-win .
everybody goes , i 'm happy .
better really hurry up .
i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are , without heart and without love it 's just -- it 's all meaningless . and that , to me , is really beautiful .
except for that creepy guy in the background .
getting back to the point of my particular presentation , kepler , one of my great heroes , who realized that these five solids , which i spoke of earlier , were related somehow to the planets , but he couldn 't prove it . it freaked him out .
but it did lead to newton discovering gravity .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge . now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp .
i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there . but ...
that 's not a good picture .
not a good picture . now , my friends in the island of nevis are a little better . look at that ! that 's isaac newton .
that guy is rockin ' .
what a handsome cat .
once again , nicaragua let me down .
and copernicus looks like johnny carson , which is really weird .
i don 't get that at all .
once again , these guys rock it out .
isaac is kickin ' ass . man , he looks like a rock star .
this is freaky is a major way .
this is sierra leone .
they got little babies in there , floating in there .
man . i don 't really need to comment on this . but i didn 't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues . did you ?
when did this happen ?
it 's a different kind of course . and they 've got five apples ?
i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid .
although five is a good number , of course .
ecuador , my friend kepler , as you can see , they call him juan .
juan ? no ! johannes , not juan .
it wasn 't carlos chaplain . it 's wrong .
rene descartes , of course . once again these grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination .
he 's all murky . there is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . we gotta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen .
this is , of course , the cartesian coordinates .
once again , that 's sierra leone .
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
because that 's why we 're here , really , i think to figure stuff out and to love each other .
descartes .
before the horse .
now , monaco took descartes , and just flipped him around .
now , monaco is problematic for me , and i 'll show you why .
here is a map . all they have is a casino on it .
and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don 't even want to hazard a guess .
but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently .
this is the flag of monaco . ladies and gentlemen , the flag of indonesia . please examine .
not sure how this came to be , but it 's not right .
in monaco , " no , what are you talking about ?
they are so different .
look , ours is more red , it 's longer .
they stole our flag ! they stole our flag ! " bode 's law wasn 't even his law . it was a guy named titus .
and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn 't really work .
that 's jude law and some of his films recently didn 't work .
just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .
and i wonder if the photographer said , " okay , jude , could you touch your tooth ? that 's good . " just a tip , if you 're being photographed for press pictures , don 't touch your teeth .
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites .
golden section , i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born .
i know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section , because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter , as i refer to it .
if fibonacci had been on paxil , that would be the fibonacci series .
" ten milligram , 20 milligram . "
" leonardo , dinner 's ready , put down those books and take your pills . "
" yes , mama . "
alright where is this going ? that 's a good question .
here is the premise that i began 27 years ago .
if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live , i reason , through some sort of reverse engineering , we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe .
and that 's what i did . twenty-seven years ago i started working on this .
and i tried to build a particle accelerator .
and that didn 't work out well .
so , then i thought a calculator is a metaphor .
i can just divide numbers , that 's like atom smashing .
that 's what i did . that 's how i found moleeds .
moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved .
they are the nodes on the string , patterns and relationships , 27 , 37 .
that was the first chart i came up with .
you can see , even if you don 't go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
the numbers from one to 36 , divided into six groups .
symmetry , pairs .
every top adds up to 37 .
bottom , all 74 .
there is so many intricate relationships that i 'm not going to go there now , because you would say , " hey , go back to the fluctus part . "
circle of fifths , acoustic harmony , geometric symmetry .
i knew those two were related .
once again , the cartesian kind of cross-over .
so , i said if i 'm going to put a circle , see what kind of patterns i get , boom , the red system .
look at that . you can 't just make this stuff up , ladies and gentlemen .
you can 't just go around going , " oh , i 'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they 're going to be symmetrical . and they 're all going to add up , and it 's going to be , oh yeah , i figured that out . "
this is beyond anything anybody could just make up .
there is the orange system .
and you 'll see over here , these are multiples of the number 27 .
and they recapitulate that shape , even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle of 36 . it 's nuts .
that 's the green system . it all folds in half on the green system , right between 18 and 19 .
the blue system . the violet . it 's all there .
look at that ! i mean you cannot make that stuff up .
that just doesn 't fall out of a tree , ladies and gentlemen .
twenty-seven years of my life !
and i 'm presenting it here at ted . why ?
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
" we are going to destroy the earth . hmmm ... maybe not . "
in this last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi-yau manifolds in a way that doesn 't necessitate these little hidden dimensions .
which works mathematically , but it just doesn 't seem god-like to me .
it just seems like it 's not sexy and elegant , it 's hidden .
i don 't want hidden , i want to see it .
i found other pairs all have symmetry , even though , unlike the master one , their symmetry is split .
unbelievable . this is like crazy .
am i the only one that sees this ?
you know , i didn 't just draw this in a day , by the way .
you know , try making some charts like this at home .
you gotta be accurate ! there 's measurement involved , increments .
these are maps , by the way .
not stamps , but one day .
okay , i 'm getting to the punch . golden ratio , it 's crazy .
and look at this , built within it is the golden ratio .
i start looking at that , and look at them again .
they start looking like planets .
i go to jpl .
i look at the orbits of the planets .
i find 18 examples of it in our solar system .
i never told anybody . this is the first thing . this could be history .
kepler was right .
eighteen and 19 , the middle of the moleeds , 0.618 is the golden section . multiply them together , 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247 .
which is .005 different from the number of days in a year .
hey , you can 't make this up .
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / guy _ philippe _ goldstein _ how _ cyberattacks _ threaten _ real _ world _ peace.html
more and more , nations are waging attacks with cyber weapons -- silent strikes on another country 's computer systems that leave behind no trace . at tedxparis , guy-philippe goldstein shows how cyberattacks can leap between the digital and physical worlds to prompt armed conflict -- and how we might avert this global security hazard .

guy-philippe goldstein : how cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
good afternoon .
if you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between china and the u.s. regarding cyberattacks against the american company google .
many things have been said about this . some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation -- and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
however , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous . they 're of a new nature : they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle .
these virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world .
in 1982 , in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia , a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons , the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .
now we know today -- this was revealed by thomas reed , ronald reagan 's former u.s. air force secretary -- this explosion was actually the result of a cia sabotage operation , in which they had managed to infiltrate the it management systems of that pipeline .
more recently , the u.s. government revealed that in september 2008 , more than 3 million people in the state of espirito santo in brazil were plunged into darkness , victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates .
even more worrying for the americans , in december 2008 the holiest of holies , the it systems of centcom , the central command managing the wars in iraq and afghanistan , may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these : plain but infected usb keys . and with these keys , they may have been able to get inside centcom 's systems , to see and hear everything , and maybe even infect some of them .
as a result , the americans take the threat very seriously . i 'll quote general james cartwright , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who says in a report to congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .
moreover , the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .
and across the world today , we see a sort of cyber arms race , with cyberwar units built up by countries like north korea or even iran .
yet , what you 'll never hear from spokespeople from the pentagon or the french department of defence is that the question isn 't really who 's the enemy , but actually the very nature of cyber weapons .
and to understand why , we must look at how , through the ages , military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace .
for example , if we 'd had tedxparis 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive vauban-style fortifications -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe. which was indeed the case in europe between 1650 and 1750 .
similarly , if we 'd had this talk 30 or 40 years ago , we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons , and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply , prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers .
however , if we 'd had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies , which give the advantage to the attacker , make the blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in europe .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons .
the first issue : imagine a potential enemy announcing they 're building a cyberwar unit , but only for their country 's defense .
okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
it gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous .
just 3 years ago , both the u.s. and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their it systems .
but today both countries say the best defense is to attack .
and so , they 're joining china , whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been both defensive and offensive .
the second issue : your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness , and you may not even know who 's attacking you .
cyber weapons have this peculiar feature : they can be used without leaving traces .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker ,
because the defender doesn 't know who to fight back against .
and if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary , they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated .
this issue isn 't just theoretical .
in may 2007 , estonia was the victim of cyberattacks , that damaged its communication and banking systems .
estonia accused russia .
but nato , though it defends estonia , reacted very prudently . why ?
because nato couldn 't be 100 % sure that the kremlin was indeed behind these attacks .
so to sum up , on the one hand , when a possible enemy announces they 're building a cyberwar unit , you don 't know whether it 's for attack or defense . on the other hand , we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking .
in a major article published in 1978 , professor robert jervis of columbia university in new york described a model to understand how conflicts could arise .
in this context , when you don 't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .
this is the environment that 's being created by cyber weapons today , and historically it was the environment in europe at the onset of world war i .
so cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they 're emerging in a much more unstable environment .
if you remember the cold war , it was a very hard game , but a stable one played only by two players , which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers .
today we 're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at copenhagen . and this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons .
why ? because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack .
so nations may live under the threat of what nobel prize winner thomas schelling called the " reciprocal fear of surprise attack , " as i don 't know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not -- i may never know -- so i might take the upper hand and attack first .
just last week , in a new york times article dated january 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the national security agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the u.s. was about to be cyberattacked .
and these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
in may 2009 , general kevin chilton , commander of the u.s. nuclear forces , stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the u.s. , all options would be on the table .
cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons --
they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror .
but in doing so , they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we 've just seen , a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us : european allies , nato members , our american friends and allies , our other western allies , and maybe , by forcing their hand a little , our russian and chinese partners .
the information technologies joel de rosnay was talking about , which were historically born from military research , are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction , which could tomorrow , if we 're not careful , completely destroy world peace .
thank you .

jim toomey : learning from sherman the shark
cartoons are basically short stories .
i tried to find one that didn 't have a whole lot of words .
not all of them have happy endings .
so how did i get started cartooning ?
i doodled a lot as a kid , and if you spend enough time doodling , sooner or later , something happens : all your career options run out .
so you have to make a living cartooning .
actually , i fell in love with the ocean when i was a little boy , when i was about eight or nine .
this is some of my early work .
eventually , my mom took the red crayon away , so it was [ unclear ] .
but i 'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it 's become the foundation of my work because , i feel like , if in a day , i can see the ocean differently , then i can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
it 's just a big blue surface .
and this is how we 've seen the ocean since the beginning of time .
it 's a mystery .
there 's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
and that prompted people to make maps like this , with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land , but when you get to the waters edge , the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .
and this is the way i saw the ocean at school -- as if to say , " all geography and science lessons stop at water 's edge .
this part 's not going to be on the test . " but that day i flew low over the islands -- it was a family trip to the caribbean , and i flew in a small plane low over the islands .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
i saw forests and meadows .
i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i 'd love to hide as a kid , if i could only breathe underwater .
and best of all , i saw the animals .
i saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane i was flying in .
and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it , and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born .
so from that day on , i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
up until that day , these were the animals that were most common in my life .
these were the ones i 'd like to draw -- all variations of four legs and fur .
but when you got to the ocean , my imagination was no competition for nature .
every time i 'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board , i 'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier .
and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie .
whenever i talk to kids , i always like to tell them , the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive .
it 's not a dinosaur ; it 's a whale , animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that 's what a dinosaur looks like .
so you have living dinosaurs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
it 's just incredible ; no hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that .
or this fangtooth . the particles in the water make it look like it 's floating in outer space .
could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that ?
it would start a whole new space race .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it doesn 't capture our imagination as a society .
we say to ourselves , " maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something . "
so , what i 'd like to do now is try a little drawing .
so , i 'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here .
i love to draw the deep sea fish , because they are so ugly , but beautiful in their own way .
maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here -- give him a headlight , maybe a brake light , turn signals .
but it 's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes .
so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book .
for instance , take these sea turtles .
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman 's x-ray vision .
they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .
and they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean .
i kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with .
or take this sea cucumber .
it 's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all .
he 's like an underwater spiderman .
he shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy .
of course , sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
he can 't spin a web anytime ; he 's got to pull his pants down first .
or the blowfish .
the blowfish is like the incredible hulk .
it can change its body into a big , intimidating fish in a matter of seconds .
i 'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated .
and then i 'm going to attempt onscreen animation here .
let 's see .
try and inflate it .
" you talkin ' to me ? " see , he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating .
or take this swordfish .
could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose ?
do you think he wakes up in the morning , looks in the mirror and says , " somebody 's getting stabbed today . "
or this lionfish for instance .
imagine trying to make friends covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs .
it 's not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
my characters are -- my lead character 's a shark named sherman .
he 's a great white shark .
and i kind of broke the mold with sherman .
i didn 't want to go with this ruthless predator image .
he 's kind of just out there making a living .
he 's sort of a homer simpson with fins .
and then his sidekick is a sea turtle , as i mentioned before , named filmore .
he uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans , looking for a mate .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , lousy pick-up lines .
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .
i have a hermit crab named hawthorne , who doesn 't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab , so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark .
and then i 'll introduce you to one more character , this guy , ernest , who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body .
so with characters , you can make stories .
sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens .
so , imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom .
or , sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they 're underwater .
for instance , i took them skiing in the mid-atlantic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic .
i 've taken them to the sea of japan , where they met giant jellyfish .
i 've taken them camping in the kelp forests of california .
this next one here , i did a story on the census of marine life .
and that was a lot of fun because , as most of you know , it 's a real project we 've heard about .
but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters .
so we start off the story with ernest , who volunteers as a census taker .
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
then he meets the yeti crab , the famous vampire squid -- elusive , hard to find -- and the dumbo octopus , which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn 't have to change a thing when i drew it .
i did another story on marine debris .
i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business , and they -- i asked them , " so what 's one issue you would like everyone to know more about ? "
and they said -- this one friend of mine said , " i 've got one word for you : plastic . "
and i told him , " well , i need something a little sexier than that .
plastic just is not going to do it . "
we sort of worked things out .
he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride , which doesn 't really work in voice balloons very well .
i couldn 't fit them in .
so what i did was i made an adventure strip .
basically , this bottle travels a long way .
what i 'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn 't really go away ; it just continues to wash downstream . and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean , which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it , especially if they can 't stand each other , like these two .
so , i sent them to boise , idaho , where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system .
and it ended up in the boise river and then on to the columbia river and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch -- which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific , where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around -- and then back onto the lagoon .
so that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along .
so a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway , but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one .
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
it was on shark finning , and i felt really strongly about this issue . and i felt like , since my main character was a shark , the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
it 's cruel , it 's wasteful .
there 's nothing funny or entertaining about it , but i really wanted to take this issue on .
i had to kill my main character , who is a shark .
we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant , who gets a fortune that he 's about to get caught by a trawler , which he does .
and then he dies .
he gets finned , and then he gets thrown overboard .
ostensibly , he 's dead now .
and so i killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for 15 years .
so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one .
meanwhile , the other characters are talking about shark fin soup .
i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .
sherman 's up in shark heaven .
this is what i love about comic strips , you know .
you really don 't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
you can kind of do anything .
it becomes a near-death experience for sherman .
meanwhile , ernest finds his fins on the internet .
there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins , so i kind of exposed that .
and he clicks the " buy now " button .
and voila , next-day air , they show up , and they surgically reattach them .
i ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition that encouraged our national marine fishery service , to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management .
thanks .
i 'd like to end with a little metaphor here .
i 've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent mission blue , and this is what i came up with .
imagine you 're in an enormous room , and it 's as dark as a cave .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you can 't see anything .
you 've been given one tool , a hammer .
so you wander around in the darkness , and you bump into something , and it feels like it 's made of stone .
it 's big , it 's heavy . you can 't carry it away , so you bang it with your hammer , and you break off a piece .
and you take the piece out into the daylight .
and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .
so you say to yourself , " well , that 's worth something . "
so you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away .
and you find other things , and you break that up , and you haul those away .
and you 're getting all kinds of cool stuff .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
and then some yells , " stop ! "
and they turn up the lights .
and you realize where you are ; you 're in the louvre .
and you 've taken all this complexity and beauty , and you 've turned it into a cheap commodity .
and that 's what we 're doing with the ocean .
and part of what mission blue is about is yelling , " stop ! "
so that each of us -- explorer , scientist , cartoonist , singer , chef -- can turn up the lights in their own way .
and that 's what i hope my comic strip does in a small way .
that 's why i like what i do .
thanks for listening .

arthur benjamin does " mathemagic "
well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
my name is art benjamin , and i am a " mathemagician . "
what that means is , i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call " mathemagics . "
but before i get started , i have a quick question for the audience .
by any chance , did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator ?
seriously , if you have a calculator with you , raise your hand , raise your hand .
i -- was -- your hand go up ?
now bring it out , bring it out . anybody else ?
i see , i see one way in the back .
you sir , that 's three ,
and anybody on this side here ?
ok , you over there on the aisle . would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators , then join me up on stage .
and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause .
that 's right . now , since i haven 't had the chance to work with these calculators , i need to make sure that they are all working properly .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?
how about a two-digit number ?
audience : 22 .
arthur benjamin : 22 . and another two-digit number , sir ?
audience : 47 .
ab : multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,034 , or the calculators are not working . do all of you get 1,034 ? 1,034 ?
woman : no .
ab : 594 . let 's give three of them a nice round of applause there .
would you like to try a more standard calculator , just in case ?
ok , great .
what i 'm going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .
that 's ok . i 'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator .
there is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself .
for instance , five squared would be ?
audience : 25 .
ab : 25 . now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting " times " and then " equals , " and on most calculators that will give you the square .
on some of these ancient rpn calculators , you 've got an " x squared " button on it , will allow you to do the calculation even faster .
what i 'm going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
what i 'll use is the second row this time , and i 'll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two-digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , i will try and race you to the answer . ok ?
so quickly , a two-digit number please .
audience : 37 .
ab : 37 squared , ok .
audience : 23 .
ab : 23 squared , ok .
audience : 59 .
ab : 59 squared , ok , and finally ?
audience : 93 .
ab : 93 squared . would you call out your answers , please ?
woman : 1369 . ab : 1369 .
woman : 529 .
ab : 529 .
man : 3481 .
ab : 3481 .
man : 8649 .
ab : thank you very much .
let me try to take this one step further .
i 'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time .
i won 't even write these down -- i 'll just call them out as they 're called out to me .
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
just give some indication if it 's right .
a three-digit number , sir , yes ?
audience : 987 .
ab : 987 squared is 974,169 .
yes ? good .
another , another three-digit -- -- another three-digit number , sir ?
audience : 457 .
ab : 457 squared is 205,849 .
205,849 ?
yes ?
ok , another , another three-digit number , sir ?
audience : 321 .
ab : 321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
yes ? one more three-digit number please .
audience : oh , 722 .
ab : 722 is 500 -- ooh , that 's a harder one .
is that 513,284 ?
woman : yes .
ab : yes ? oh , one more , one more three-digit number please .
audience : 162 .
162 squared is 26,244 .
thank you very much .
let me try to take this one step further .
i 'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time .
now you can all take your time on this ; i will not beat you to the answer on this one , but i will try to get the answer right .
to make this a little bit more random , let 's take the fourth row this time , let 's say , one , two , three , four .
if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine , that will be the four-digit number that i 'll square .
audience : nine .
ab : nine .
audience : seven . ab : seven .
audience : five . ab : five .
audience : eight . ab : eight .
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
95,218,564 ?
woman : yes .
ab : thank you very much .
now , i would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and i can -- but unfortunately most calculators cannot .
eight-digit capacity -- don 't you hate that ?
so , since we 've reached the limits of our calculators -- what 's that ? does yours go -- woman : i don 't know .
ab : does yours go higher ?
oh -- yours does ?
man : i can probably do it .
ab : i 'll talk to you later .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .
let 's take the largest number on the board here , 8649 .
would you each enter that on your calculator ?
and instead of squaring it this time , i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want , but don 't tell me what you 're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number .
so you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number .
how many digits do you have , six or seven ?
seven , and yours ? woman : seven .
ab : seven ? seven ?
and , uncertain .
man : yeah .
ab : seven . is there any possible way that i could know what seven digit numbers you have ? say " no . "
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits , any six of them , in any order you 'd like .
one digit at a time , i shall try and determine the digit you 've left out .
so , starting with your seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
woman : one , ok , 197042 .
ab : did you leave out the number 6 ?
woman : yes , ab : good , ok , that 's one .
you have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
woman : 44875 .
ab : i think i only heard five numbers . i -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
woman : yes . ab : same as she did , ok . you 've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear .
man : 079044 . ab : i think you left out the number 3 ?
that 's three . the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 : 10 to the fourth power .
ok , any six of them .
really scramble them up this time , please .
man : 263972 .
ab : did you leave out the number 7 ?
and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause .
thank you very much .
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
by any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
if you think you know your birth day , raise your hand .
let 's see , starting with -- let 's start with a gentleman first ,
ok sir , what year was it , first of all ? that 's why i start with a gentleman first .
what year ?
audience : 1953 .
ab : 1953 , and the month ?
audience : november . ab : november what ?
audience : 23rd .
ab : 23rd -- was that a monday ? audience : yes .
yes , good . somebody else ? who else would like -- see i don 't -- haven 't seen any women 's hands up .
ok , it 's -- how about you , what year ?
audience : 1949 . ab : 1949 , and the month ?
audience : october . ab : october what ?
audience : fifth .
ab : fifth -- was that a wednesday ?
yes , my -- i 'll go way to the back right now , how about you ?
yell it out , what year ? audience : 1959 .
ab : 1959 , ok -- and the month ?
audience : february .
ab : february what ? audience : sixth .
ab : sixth -- was that a friday ? audience : yes .
good , how about the person behind her ?
call -- call -- what year was it ?
audience : 1947 . ab : 1947 , and the month ?
audience : may . ab : may what ?
audience : seventh . ab : seventh -- would that be a wednesday ?
audience : yes .
ab : thank you very much .
anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born ?
we can do it that way .
of course , i could just make up an answer and you wouldn 't know , so i come prepared for that .
i brought with me a book of calendars .
it goes as far back into the past as 1800 , ' cause you never know .
i didn 't mean to look at you , sir -- you were just sitting there .
anyway , chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn 't mind .
this is a book of calendars , and i 'll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : 1966 .
ab : ' 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
audience : april . ab : april what ?
audience : 17th . ab : 17th -- i believe that was a sunday .
can you confirm , chris ?
chris anderson : yes . ab : yeah , ok . i 'll tell you what , chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a favor , turn to a year outside of the 1900s ,
either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that 'll be a much greater challenge for me .
what year , chris , would you like ?
ca : 1824 .
ab : 1824 , ok .
and what month ? ca : june .
ab : june what ? ca : sixth .
ab : sixth -- was that a sunday ?
ca : it was . ab : and it was cloudy .
good , thank you very much .
but i 'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
there was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
where is he , would you stand up , 10-digit guy ?
ok , well stand up for me just for a second , so i can see where you are .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
ok , what i 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , i 'm going to do this problem thinking out loud .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we 're ok .
so , let 's see , let 's take a -- let 's take a different row of people , starting with you .
i 'll get five digits : one , two , three , four -- oh , i did this row already . let 's do the row before you , starting with you sir : one , two , three , four , five .
call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that i will try to square . go ahead .
audience : five . ab : five .
audience : seven . ab : seven .
audience : six . ab : six .
audience : eight . ab : eight .
audience : three . ab : three .
57,683 squared . yuck .
let me explain to you how i 'm going to attempt this problem .
i 'm going to break the problem down into three parts .
i 'll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
add all those numbers together , and with any luck , arrive at the answer .
now , let me recap .
thank you .
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
while i do these calculation [ s ] , you might hear certain words , as opposed to numbers , creep into the calculation .
let me explain what that is .
this is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that i use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
i store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
i know it sounds complicated ; it 's not -- i just don 't want you to think you 're seeing something out of " rain man " here .
there 's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
if you want to talk to me about adhd afterwards , you can talk to me then . all right -- by the way , one last instruction , for my judges with the calculators -- ok , you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that i will make a mistake here .
if i do , don 't tell me what the mistake is ;
just say , " you 're close , " or something like that , and i 'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself .
if , however , i am right , whatever you do , don 't keep it to yourself , ok ?
make sure everybody knows that i got the answer right , because this is my big finish , ok .
so , without any more stalling , here we go .
i 'll start the problem in the middle , with 57 times 683 .
now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that 's 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
that seems right , i 'll go on . cookie fission , ok .
next , i do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so i can say , three billion . take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but i see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , ok , finally , we do 683 squared , that 's 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if i need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
audience : yeah !
ab : good .
thank you very much .
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics . thank you .

clifford stoll on ... everything
i 'm delighted to be here .
i 'm honored by the invitation , and thanks .
i would love to talk about stuff that i 'm interested in , but unfortunately , i suspect that what i 'm interested in won 't interest many other people .
first off , my badge says i 'm an astronomer .
i would love to talk about my astronomy , but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter .
so i 'm not going to talk about that .
it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at lawrence berkeley labs .
and i caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb , and stealing information and selling it .
and i 'd love to talk about that -- and it 'd be fun -- but , 20 years later ...
i find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
it 's tedious .
i 'm -- the first time you do something , it 's science .
the second time , it 's engineering .
a third time , it 's just being a technician .
i 'm a scientist . once i do something , i do something else .
so , i 'm not going to talk about that .
nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book , " silicon snake oil , " or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don 't belong in schools .
i feel that there 's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
my idea is : no ! no !
get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
and i 'd love to talk about this , but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn 't need much talking about -- but i guess i may be very wrong about that , and everything else that i 've said .
so don 't go back and read my dissertation .
it probably has lies in it as well .
having said that , i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
i 'm supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
oh , right . and my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because i 've got gray hair , and so , it 's kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don 't ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
no ! don 't ask somebody who 's writing code .
no , if you want to know what society 's going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
they know .
in fact , don 't ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
they 're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
i don 't . nor , i suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
but to me , things aren 't the future .
what i ask myself is , what 's society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
but that 's not what i 'm going to talk about .
i 'd love to talk about it , it 'd be fun , but i want to talk about what i 'm doing now . what am i doing now ?
oh -- the other thing that i think i 'd like to talk about is right over here . right over here .
is that visible ? what i 'd like to talk about is one-sided things .
i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
because i love mobius loops . i not only love mobius loops , but i 'm one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes klein bottles .
right away , i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
this is a klein bottle .
for those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , i know all about it .
it 's one sided . it 's a bottle whose inside is its outside .
it has zero volume . and it 's non-orientable .
it has wonderful properties .
if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
and i 'd love to talk to you about this , but i don 't have much in the way of ... things to say because -- however , the " d " in ted of course stands for design .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i 've been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
but what i 've just made -- and i 'm delighted to show you , first time in public here .
this is a klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all , it 's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
so it 's highly -- that one 's the cool one .
that was a month of my life .
but although i would love to talk about topology with you , i 'm not going to .
instead , i 'm going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
could somebody put this guy up ?
and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing -- well , sitting -- in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
and i looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when i was working at the electronic music studio !
as a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at suny buffalo . and wow !
way back machine . and i said to myself , oh yeah !
and it sent me back .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
this guy over here of course is me .
this man is robert moog , the inventor of the moog synthesizer , who passed away this past august .
robert moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
a musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at suny buffalo .
he 'd come up from trumansburg to teach me not just about the moog synthesizer , but we 'd be sitting there -- i 'm studying physics at the time . this is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
we 're studying physics , i 'm studying physics , and he 's saying , " that 's a good thing to do .
don 't get caught up in electronic music if you 're doing physics . "
mentoring me . he 'd come up and spend hours and hours with me .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
in the background , my bicycle .
i realize that this picture was taken at a friend 's living room .
bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this .
we sat around talking about fourier transforms ,
bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog .
and i 'll just say what i 'm about to do . what i 'm about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there 's a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
kids . kids is what i 'm going to talk about -- is that okay ?
it says kids over here , that 's what i 'd like to talk about .
i 've decided that , for me at least , i don 't have a big enough head .
so i think locally and i act locally .
i feel that the best way i can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
so ph.d. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
and one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , " well , how come you ain 't teaching ? "
and i said , " well , i 've taught graduate -- i 've had graduate students , i 've taught undergraduate classes . "
no , they said , " if you 're so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain 't over here on the front lines ?
put your money where you mouth is . "
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
not just showing up every now and then .
no , no , no , no , no . i take attendance .
i take lunch hour .
this is not -- no , no , no , this is not claps .
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
not just show up to class every now and then .
teach a solid week . okay , i 'm teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
one of the things that i 've done for my science students is to tell them , " look , i 'm going to teach you college-level physics .
no calculus , i 'll cut out that .
you won 't need to know trig .
but you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we 're going to do serious experiments .
none of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
we 're going to be doing genuine physics . "
and that 's one of the things i thought i 'd do right now .
oh , before i even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class -- this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
my students in el cerrito -- with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope -- measured the speed of light .
we were off by 25 percent . how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
in addition to that , we 've measured the speed of sound .
i 'd love to measure the speed of light here .
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , " aw man , "
i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
and i 'm all set to do it . i 'm all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
and there 's no time to do it .
so , next time , maybe , i 'll measure the speed of light !
but meanwhile , let 's measure the speed of sound !
well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
but , probably -- one of my students , ariel [ unclear ] , said , " could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? "
and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
is a constant . when the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . so , if we have a wave here -- over here , that 's what 's interesting -- as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
right ? this is simple physics .
all of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
what they didn 't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics -- but they should have , and i wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
and that constant is the speed of sound .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all i 've got to do is know its frequency . well , that 's easy .
i 've got a frequency counter right here .
set it up to around a , above a , above a. there 's an a , more or less .
now , so i know the frequency .
it 's 1.76 kilohertz . i measure its wavelength .
all i need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
so anytime i talk , you 'd see it on the screen .
i 'll put it over here , and as i move this away from the source , you 'll notice the spiral .
the slinky moves . we 're going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
those of you who are physicists , i hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me .
to measure the wavelength , all i need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here .
from here to here is the wavelength of sound .
so , i 'll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
i 've moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
ok , let 's go back to mr. elmo .
and we 'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
the wavelength was 0.2 meters .
let 's figure out what this is .
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
if you look it up in the book , it 's really 343 .
but , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we 've been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . pretty good .
all of which comes to what i wanted to say .
go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
it was 1971 , the vietnam war was going on , and i 'm like , " oh my god ! "
i 'm studying physics : landau , lipschitz , resnick and halliday .
i 'm going home for a midterm . a riot 's going on on campus .
there 's a riot ! hey , elmo 's done : off .
there 's a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
i 'm walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , " you ! you 're a student . "
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes by my head . whoosh !
i get a breath of tear gas and i can 't breathe .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
he wants to clunk me over the head !
i 'm saying , " i got to clear out of here ! "
i go running across campus quick as i can . i duck into hayes hall .
it 's one of these bell-tower buildings .
the cop 's chasing me .
chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
chases me into this room .
the entranceway to the bell tower .
i slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking .
and i 'm thinking , " oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . "
i keep climbing up , go back .
i go to a place where a dowel splits off .
there 's a clock , clock , clock , clock .
the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it .
i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity .
i climb up , and there 's this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
i pop up the top , and there 's a cupola .
a dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
i 'm looking out and i 'm seeing the cops bashing students ' heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
and i 'm asking , " what am i doing here ? why am i here ? "
then i remember what my english teacher in high school said . namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
so , i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and i look at it .
i 'm asking myself , " why am i here ? "
so , at this time , i 'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells : " all truth is one .
in this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . "
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / graham _ hill _ less _ stuff _ more _ happiness.html
writer and designer graham hill asks : can having less stuff , in less room , lead to more happiness ? he makes the case for taking up less space , and lays out three rules for editing your life .
culture , design , happiness , media , shopping
1238
graham hill : less stuff , more happiness
what 's in the box ?
whatever it is must be pretty important , because i 've traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
sound familiar ?
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
three times .
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
nope .
there 's a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry : that of personal storage .
so we 've got triple the space , but we 've become such good shoppers that we need even more space .
so where does this lead ?
lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way , that less might actually equal more .
i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college -- in your dorm , traveling -- in a hotel room , camping -- rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
it 's actually a great way to save you some money .
and it 's going to give you a little more ease in your life .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
i wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
with over 300 entries from around the world , i got it , my own little jewel box .
by buying a space that was 420 sq. ft. instead of 600 , immediately i 'm saving 200 grand .
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
and because it 's really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me , i 'm really excited to be there .
so how can you live little ?
three main approaches .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives .
and that shirt that i hadn 't worn in years ?
it 's time for me to let it go .
we 've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow .
we need to think before we buy .
ask ourselves , " is that really going to make me happier ? truly ? " by all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
but we want stuff that we 're going to love for years , not just stuff .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
we want space efficiency .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
you can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear -- it 's magic .
finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed -- same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
my office folds away ,
easily hidden .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
guests ? move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
and of course , my own movie theater .
so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft .
but consider the benefits of an edited life .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
so when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , " could i do with a little life editing ?
would that give me a little more freedom ?
maybe a little more time ? " what 's in the box ?
it doesn 't really matter .
i know i don 't need it .
what 's in yours ?
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
so let 's make room for the good stuff .
thank you .

stuart brown says play is more than fun
so , here we go : a flyby of play . it 's got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february 17th sunday magazine about play .
at the bottom of this , it says , " it 's deeper than gender .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
and a sandbox for new ideas about evolution . "
not bad , except if you look at that cover , what 's missing ?
you see any adults ?
well , lets go back to the 15th century . this is a courtyard in europe , and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play .
all ages , solo play , body play , games , taunting .
and there it is . and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then .
i think we may have lost something in our culture .
so i 'm gonna take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence .
north of churchill , manitoba , in october and november , there 's no ice on hudson bay .
and this polar bear that you see , this 1200-pound male , he 's wild and fairly hungry .
and norbert rosing , a german photographer , is there on scene , making a series of photos of these huskies , who are tethered .
and from out of stage left comes this wild , male polar bear , with a predatory gaze .
any of you who 've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you , there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you 're in trouble .
but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow , wagging her tail .
and something very unusual happens .
that fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal -- changes .
and this polar bear stands over the husky ,
no claws extended , no fangs taking a look .
and they begin an incredible ballet .
a play ballet .
this is in nature : it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death .
and if you 'll begin to look closely at the husky that 's bearing her throat to the polar bear , and look a little more closely , they 're in an altered state .
they 're in a state of play .
and it 's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .
they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that 's within all of us .
now how did i get involved in this ?
john mentioned that i 've done some work with murderers , and i have .
the texas tower murderer opened my eyes , in retrospect , when we studied his tragic mass murder , to the importance of play , in that that individual , by deep study , was found to have severe play deprivation .
charles whitman was his name .
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at virginia tech .
and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play , but i didn 't really understand what it was .
and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that i didn 't really have a full understanding of it .
and i don 't think any of us has a full understanding of it , by any means .
but there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy , a way of thinking about it .
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
when that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile , what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother .
and she begins to babble and coo and smile , and so does the baby .
if we 've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram , the right brain of each of them becomes attuned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we 're beginning to get a handle on .
and i 'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans .
and so now i 'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it 's never just singularly one thing .
we 're going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
this is a mountain goat .
if you 're having a bad day , try this : jump up and down , wiggle around -- you 're going to feel better .
and you may feel like this character , who is also just doing it for its own sake .
it doesn 't have a particular purpose , and that 's what 's great about play .
if its purpose is more important than the act of doing it , it 's probably not play .
and there 's a whole other type of play , which is object play .
and this japanese macaque has made a snowball , and he or she 's going to roll down a hill .
and -- they don 't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ;
the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
jpl we heard this morning -- jpl is an incredible place .
they have located two consultants , frank wilson and nate johnson ,
who are -- frank wilson is a neurologist , nate johnson is a mechanic .
he taught mechanics in a high school in long beach , and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems .
and he tried to figure out why . and he came to the conclusion , quite on his own , that the students who could no longer solve problems , such as fixing cars , hadn 't worked with their hands .
frank wilson had written a book called " the hand . "
they got together -- jpl hired them .
now jpl , nasa and boeing , before they will hire a research and development problem solver -- even if they 're summa cum laude from harvard or cal tech -- if they haven 't fixed cars , haven 't done stuff with their hands early in life , played with their hands , they can 't problem-solve as well .
so play is practical , and it 's very important .
now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration .
but it has to be safe exploration .
this happens to be ok -- he 's an anatomically interested little boy and that 's his mom . other situations wouldn 't be quite so good .
but curiosity , exploration , are part of the play scene .
if you want to belong , you need social play .
and social play is part of what we 're about here today , and is a byproduct of the play scene .
rough and tumble play .
these lionesses , seen from a distance , looked like they were fighting .
but if you look closely , they 're kind of like the polar bear and husky : no claws , flat fur , soft eyes , open mouth with no fangs , balletic movements , curvilinear movements -- all specific to play .
and rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
spectator play , ritual play -- we 're involved in some of that .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment -- rare -- where the red sox won the world series .
but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture , and you can get a sense that they 're all at play .
imaginative play .
i love this picture because my daughter , who 's now almost 40 , is in this picture , but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination , her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool .
a really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play .
and i love this one , because it 's also what we 're about .
we all have an internal narrative that 's our own inner story .
the unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story .
i 'm telling you a story today about play .
well , this bushman , i think , is talking about the fish that got away that was that long , but it 's a fundamental part of the play scene .
so what does play do for the brain ?
well , a lot .
we don 't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain , because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .
i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant .
they 'd given me a large grant when i was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record ,
and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
i think that -- that 's a few years back -- i think that wave is past , and the play wave is cresting , because there is some good science .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum , puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed , and -- and , and , and .
so it 's -- for me , its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that 's associated with play , and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn 't really thought of it that way .
and that 's part of what the national institute for play is all about .
and this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
i 'm sorry i don 't have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
and we 've got a mother-infant play scenario that we 're hoping to complete underway at the moment .
the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does .
the animal world has objectified it .
in the animal world , if you take rats , who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak , they wrestle , they pin each other , that 's part of their play .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you 're experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you 're experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they 're hardwired to flee and hide .
pretty smart -- they don 't want to get killed by a cat .
so what happens ?
they both hide out .
the non-players never come out -- they die .
the players slowly explore the environment , and begin again to test things out .
that says to me , at least in rats -- and i think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture -- that play may be pretty important for our survival .
and , and , and -- there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about .
now , this is a consequence of play deprivation .
this took a long time -- i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple eegs , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
and we do know that in domestic animals and others , when they 're play deprived , they don 't -- and rats also -- they don 't develop a brain that is normal .
now , the program says that the opposite of play is not work , it 's depression .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flirtation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
try and imagine a culture or a life , adult or otherwise without play .
and the thing that 's so unique about our species is that we 're really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
and we all have capacity to play signal .
nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .
what 's going to follow from that behavior is play .
and you can trust it .
the basis of human trust is established through play signals .
and we begin to lose those signals , culturally and otherwise , as adults .
that 's a shame .
i think we 've got a lot of learning to do .
now , jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps .
so part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal , facial , body , gestural .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we 're getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
you may not know this word ,
but it should be your biological first name and last name .
because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood .
and we are , by physical anthropologists , by many , many studies , the most neotenous , the most youthful , the most flexible , the most plastic of all creatures .
and therefore , the most playful .
and this gives us a leg up on adaptability .
now , there is a way of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here , which is the play history .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
kevin carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances : alcoholic mother , absent father , inner-city philadelphia , black , had to take care of a younger brother .
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different .
and so he followed up on it .
and his life -- the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death -- he become a linguist , a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker .
and he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life .
now there 's another play history that i think is a work in progress .
those of you who remember al gore , during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency , may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person ,
at least in public .
and looking at his history , which is common in the press , it seems to me , at least -- looking at it from a shrink 's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed .
summers were hard , hard work , in the heat of tennessee summers .
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington , d.c .
and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because i do know something about that -- he wasn 't as empowered , i think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history .
so what i would encourage on an individual level to do , is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear , joyful , playful image that you have ,
whether it 's with a toy , on a birthday or on a vacation .
and begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now .
and you 'll find , you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when i 've had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play .
or you 'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it .
most of us work with groups , and i put this up because the d.school , the design school at stanford , thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment , has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called " from play to innovation . " and you 'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play , which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking :
" to explore play behavior , its development and its biological basis ;
to apply those principles , through design thinking , to promote innovation in the corporate world ;
and the students will work with real-world partners on design projects with widespread application . "
this is our maiden voyage in this .
we 're about two and a half , three months into it , and it 's really been fun .
there is our star pupil , this labrador , who taught a lot of us what a state of play is , and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there .
and brendan boyle , rich crandall -- and on the far right is , i think , a person who will be in cahoots with george smoot for a nobel prize -- stuart thompson , in neuroscience .
so we 've had brendan , who 's from ideo , and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom .
and one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring , and to try and do something about it .
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
narrator : flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing .
characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
attendees at meetings don 't know when they 'll get back to the task that they left at their desk .
but it doesn 't have to be that way .
some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it 's over .
take the meeting off , and have peace of mind that you can come back to me .
because when you need it again , the meeting is literally hanging in your closet .
the wearable meeting .
because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .
but when you take it off --
that 's when the real action happens .
stuart brown : so i would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute , hour by hour , with body , object , social , fantasy , transformational kinds of play .
and i think you 'll have a better and more empowered life .
thank you .
john hockenberry : so it sounds to me like what you 're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- i think i 've heard this , in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play , that somehow , the way animals and humans deal with play , is that it 's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity .
your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong .
sb : yeah , i don 't think that 's accurate , and i think probably because animals have taught us that .
if you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do , and we 've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they 're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn 't played .
and if you imagine a kid pretending to be king kong , or a race car driver , or a fireman , they don 't all become race car drivers or firemen , you know .
so there 's a disconnect between preparation for the future -- which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as -- and thinking of it as a separate biological entity .
and this is where my chasing animals for four , five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what i am now , which is that play has a biological place , just like sleep and dreams do .
and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically , animals sleep and dream , and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .
the next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
so it 's not just something you do in your spare time .
jh : how do you keep -- and i know you 're part of the scientific research community , and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else -- how do you prevent -- and some of the data that you 've produced , the good science that you 're talking about you 've produced , is hot to handle .
how do you prevent either the media 's interpretation of your work or the scientific community 's interpretation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mozart metaphor , where , " oh , mris show
that play enhances your intelligence .
well , let 's round these kids up , put them in pens and make them play for months at a time ; they 'll all be geniuses and go to harvard . "
how do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you 're developing ?
sb : well , i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .
so people know that it 's there .
and then you get an fmri specialist , and you get frank wilson , and you get other kinds of hard scientists , including neuroendocrinologists .
and you get them into a group together focused on play , and it 's pretty hard not to take it seriously .
unfortunately , that hasn 't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation , national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .
i mean you don 't hear about anything that 's like cancer or heart disease associated with play .
and yet i see it as something that 's just as basic for survival -- long term -- as learning some of the basic things about public health .
jh : stuart brown , thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / homaro _ cantu _ ben _ roche _ cooking _ as _ alchemy.html
homaro cantu and ben roche come from moto , a chicago restaurant that plays with new ways to cook and eat food . but beyond the fun and flavor-tripping , there 's a serious intent : can we use new food technology for good ?
agriculture , business , creativity , culture , food
1304
homaro cantu + ben roche : cooking as alchemy
ben roche : so i 'm ben , by the way . homaro cantu : and i 'm homaro .
br : and we 're chefs . so when moto opened in 2004 , people didn 't really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the flavor of , you know , a standard maki roll , printed onto a little piece of paper .
hc : so our diners started to get bored with this idea , and we decided to give them the same course twice , so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish .
so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood .
the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes . a little bit of seafood and some creme fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish .
br : but it 's not all just edible pictures .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , we have carrot cake .
so we take a carrot cake , put it in a blender , and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , jupiter 's floating around your plate .
so yeah , we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
hc : and here 's something we have no reference to eat . this is a cigar , and basically it 's a cuban cigar made out of a cuban pork sandwich , so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder , we fashion that into ash . we take
the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green , put an edible label that bears no similarity to a cohiba cigar label , and we put it in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it .
hc : delicious .
br : that 's not it , though .
instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn 't eat , we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know .
so this is a plate of nachos .
the difference between our nachos and the other guy 's nachos , is that this is actually a dessert .
so the chips are candied , the ground beef is made from chocolate , and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese .
and after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this , of these ingredients , we realized that it was pretty cool , because as we served it , we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing , where the cheese begins to melt .
so when you 're looking at this thing in the dining room , you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos , and it 's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert , and it 's just kind of like a mind-ripper .
hc : so we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic 's shop than a kitchen , and the next logical step for us was to install a state-of-the-art laboratory , and that 's what we have here .
so we put this in the basement , and we got really serious about food , like serious experimentation .
br : one of the really cool things about the lab , besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen , is that , you know , with this new equipment , and this new approach , all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open , and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created , they just kept going further and further out there .
hc : let 's talk about flavor transformation , and let 's actually make some cool stuff .
you see a cow with its tongue hanging out .
what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious . what is that cow eating ?
and why is it delicious ?
so the cow , basically , eats three basic things in their feed : corn , beets , and barley , and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy , wild ideas . can we take what the cow eats , remove the cow , and then make some hamburgers out of that ?
and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
br : yeah , that 's our chef de cuisine , chris jones . this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task , but a lot of these ideas , they 're hard to understand .
they 're hard to just get automatically .
there 's a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and error -- i guess , more error -- that goes into each and every dish , so we don 't always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
hc : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty , and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat .
this is made from three ingredients : beets , barley , corn , and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat , looks and tastes like hamburger meat , and not only that , but it 's basically removing the cow from the equation .
so replicating food , taking it into that next level is where we 're going .
br : and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger , which is a cool side effect .
and a miracle berry , if you 're not familiar with it , is a natural ingredient , and it contains a special property .
it 's a glycoprotein called miraculin , a naturally occurring thing . it still freaks me out every time i eat it , but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue , so that primarily sour taste receptors , so normally things that would taste very sour or tart , somehow begin to taste very sweet .
hc : you 're about to eat a lemon , and now it tastes like lemonade .
let 's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas , and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit .
br : so you see us here cutting up some watermelon . the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate tons of food miles , wasted energy , and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna , or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place , with local , organic produce ; so we have a watermelon from wisconsin .
hc : so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things , we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon , and it makes it go from sweet to savory .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
so the key now is to make it behave like tuna .
br : and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear , we really have something that looks , tastes and behaves like the real thing .
hc : so the key thing to remember here is , we don 't really care what this tuna really is .
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it doesn 't matter .
but where is this going ?
how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology ?
so here 's the next challenge .
i told the staff , let 's just take a bunch of wild plants , think of them as food ingredients . as long as they 're non-poisonous to the human body , go out around chicago sidewalks , take it , blend it , cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at moto .
let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think .
br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this -- this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we 're , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
hc : so this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead .
so developing nations and first-world nations , imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them , food miles would basically turn into food feet .
this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are , even if we just swapped out , say , one of these for flour , that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste .
and to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers , there 's a bale of hay there and some crab apples .
and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients .
people swore they were eating barbecue sauce , and this is free food .
br : thanks , guys .

alisa miller shares the news about the news
how does the news shape the way we see the world ?
here 's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass .
and here 's how news shapes what americans see .
this map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that american network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in february of 2007 -- just one year ago .
now , this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities .
there was massive flooding in indonesia .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming .
the u.s. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq -- that 's that big green thing there -- and little else .
the combined coverage of russia , china and india , for example , reached just one percent .
when we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here 's how the world looked .
what was that story ? the death of anna nicole smith .
this story eclipsed every country except iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the ipcc report .
and the cycle continues ; as we all know , britney has loomed pretty large lately .
so , why don 't we hear more about the world ?
one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of africa , india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
and this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
local tv news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news .
and what about the web ?
the most popular news sites don 't do much better .
last year , pew and the colombia j-school analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on google news ' front page .
and they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events .
similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from u.s. news creators is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters , and don 't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .
so , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today 's college graduates , as well as less educated americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago .
and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
in recent years , americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
i know we can do better .
and can we afford not to ? thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / nathan _ wolfe _ hunts _ for _ the _ next _ aids.html
virus hunter nathan wolfe is outwitting the next pandemic by staying two steps ahead : discovering deadly new viruses where they first emerge -- passing from animals to humans among poor subsistence hunters in africa -- before they claim millions of lives .

nathan wolfe 's jungle search for viruses
when most people think about the beginnings of aids , they 're gonna think back to the 1980s .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it , hiv .
but in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before , from chimpanzees , where the virus originated , into humans who hunt these apes .
this photo was taken before the great depression in brazzaville , congo .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with hiv .
so i have a couple of really important questions for you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus ?
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the ' 40s and ' 50s , ' 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
in fact , this is not unique to hiv . the vast majority of viruses come from animals .
and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations .
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .
nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we 've seen in the case of hiv .
so during the last 15 years , i 've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i 've labeled " viral chatter , " which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .
this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations , the movement of these agents over into humans ; and by capturing this moment , we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early .
ok , so this is a picture , and i 'm going to show you some pictures now from the field .
this is a picture of a central african hunter .
it 's actually a fairly common picture .
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .
this was absolutely key for us . this is a very intimate form of connection .
so if we 're going to study viral chatter , we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals .
and so we 've been studying people like this individual .
we collect blood from them , other specimens .
we look at the diseases , which are in the animals as well as the humans .
and ideally , this is going to allow us to catch these things early on , as they 're moving over into human populations .
and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals , but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
we would actually enlist them -- which we 've done now -- to collect specimens from animals .
we give them these little pieces of filter paper .
when they sample from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted .
narrator : deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stalk their prey .
their names are patrice and patee .
they 're searching for bush meat ; forest animals they can kill to feed their families .
patrice and patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes .
they have a series of traps , of snares that they 've set up to catch wild pigs , snakes , monkeys , rodents -- anything they can , really .
patrice and patee have been out for hours but found nothing .
the animals are simply gone .
we stop for a drink of water .
then there is a rustle in the brush .
a group of hunters approach ,
their packs loaded with wild game .
there 's at least three viruses that you know about , which are in this particular monkey .
nathan wolfe : this species , yeah . and there 's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals .
these individuals are at specific risk , particularly if there 's blood contact , they 're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses .
narrator : as the hunters display their kills , something surprising happens .
they show us filter paper they 've used to collect the animals ' blood .
the blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses , part of a program dr. wolfe has spent years setting up .
nw : so this is from this animal right here , greater spot-nosed guenon .
every person who has one of those filter papers has at least , at a minimum , been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities , which presumably , from our perspective , gives them the ability to decrease their own risk , and then obviously the risk to their families , the village , the country , and the world .
nw : ok , before i continue , i think it 's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat . bush meat is the hunting of wild game .
ok ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
i 'm going to be talking about this .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they 're gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren 't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
but in fact that 's not the only question they 're going to ask you about this .
they 're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
why did we not find some other solution to this ?
they 're going to say , in regions of profound instability throughout the world , where you have intense poverty , where populations are growing and you don 't have sustainable resources like this , this is going to lead to food insecurity .
but they 're also going to ask you probably a different question .
it 's one that i think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here .
now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder -- this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you .
ok , take a look at his shirt .
you know , take a look at his face .
bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet .
but it can 't be the fault of somebody like this .
ok ? and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone .
there 's no easy solutions , but what i 'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril .
so , in 1998 , along with my mentors don burke and colonel mpoudi-ngole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world .
and my job -- at that time i was a post-doctoral fellow , and i was really tasked with setting this up .
so i said to myself , " ok , great -- we 're gonna collect all kinds of specimens . we 're gonna go to all these different locations . it 's going to be wonderful . "
you know , i looked at the map ; i picked out 17 sites ; i figured , no problem .
needless to say , i was drastically wrong . this is challenging work to do .
fortunately , i had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
we have a whole range of challenges about this work .
one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .
the person you see on the right hand side is paul delong-minutu .
he 's one of the best communicators that i 've really ever dealt with .
when i arrived i didn 't speak a word of french , and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspondent .
so we figured we 'd hire this person -- when we got there he could be a great communicator .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn 't recognize his face .
but -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
often we run into obstacles . this is us coming back from one of these very rural sites , with specimens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours .
i like to show this shot -- this is ubald tamoufe , who 's the lead investigator in our cameroon site .
ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can 't see his face .
but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he 's about to solve this problem .
which -- which he did , which he did .
just a few quick before and after shots .
this was our laboratory before .
this is what it looks like now .
early on , in order to ship our specimens , we had to have dry ice . to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg , borrow , steal to get these folks to give it to us .
now we have our own liquid nitrogen .
i like to call our laboratory the coldest place in central africa -- it might be .
and here 's a shot of me , this is the before shot of me .
no comment .
so what happened ? so during the 10 years that we 've been doing this work , we actually surprised ourselves .
we made a number of discoveries .
and what we 've found is that if you look in the right place , you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations .
that gave us a tremendous amount of hope .
what we 've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv -- so , brand new retroviruses .
and let 's face it , any new retrovirus in the human population -- it 's something we should be aware of .
it 's something we should be following . it 's not something that we should be surprised by .
needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
that 's no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
and critically , what happens in central africa doesn 't stay in central africa .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort .
through generous support and partnership scientifically with google.org and the skoll foundation , we were able to start the global viral forecasting initiative and begin work in four different sites in africa and asia .
needless to say , different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact .
so it 's not just hunters in central africa .
it 's also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia .
but really , this is just the beginning from our perspective .
our objective right now , in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving , is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots -- because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things , ideally , before they make it to blood banks , sexual networks , airplanes . and that 's really our objective .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
many people , i think , on our planet right now despair , and they think we 've reached a point where we 've discovered most of the things .
i 'm going tell you right now : please don 't despair .
if an intelligent extra-terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet , 27 out of 30 of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus , with just a few of the volumes left for plants , fungus and animals , humans being a footnote ; interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless .
this is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet .
the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about .
and yet finally , we have the tools , which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them .
thank you very much .

golan levin makes art that looks back at you
hello ! my name is golan levin .
i 'm an artist and an engineer ,
which is , increasingly , a more common kind of hybrid .
but i still fall into this weird crack where people don 't seem to understand me .
and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture .
it 's a letter from " artforum " in 1967 saying " we can 't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art . " and they still haven 't .
and lest you think that you all , as the digerati , are more enlightened , i went to the apple iphone app store the other day .
where 's art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone , which my friends and i are doing now , is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .
so , from both directions , there is kind of , i think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day ,
which i think artists are obliged to do , is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have .
in my own case , i 'm an artist , and i 'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action , and basically empowering people through interactivity .
i want people to discover themselves as actors , as creative actors , by having interactive experiences .
a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this .
this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine .
and when i say desktop , i don 't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk .
if you look carefully , you can even see a hint of the apple menu , up here in the upper left , where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .
so this is , as joy mountford once said , " the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through . "
and the thing i 'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences , not necessarily utilitarian ones .
so i write software . and that 's how i do it .
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .
because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency .
by saying " who is that person in the mirror ? oh it 's actually me . "
and so , to give an example , this is a project from last year ,
which is called the interstitial fragment processor .
and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they 're just going about their everyday business .
so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth , or with each other , these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air --
basically taking what 's often this , kind of , unseen space , or this undetected space , and making it something real , that people then can appreciate and become creative with .
so again , people discover their creative agency in this way .
and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways .
so in addition to using full-body input , something that i 've explored now , for a while , has been the use of the voice ,
which is an immensely expressive system for us , vocalizing .
song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .
and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang kohler , the so-called father of gestalt psychology , from 1927 , who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes .
and he said one of them is called maluma .
and one of them is called taketa . which is which ?
anyone want to hazard a guess ?
maluma is on top . yeah . so .
as he says here , most people answer without any hesitation .
so what we 're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia ,
which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have .
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this ,
phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
it 's about mappings between different perceptual domains , like hardness , sharpness , brightness and darkness , and the phonemes that we 're able to speak with .
so 70 years on , there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which , you know , l , m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this ,
and p , t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
so it occurred to me , what happens if we could run these backwards ?
and thus was born the project called remark ,
which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab .
and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light . and as you do , you see the shadows of your own speech .
and they sort of fly away , out of your head .
if a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you 're saying , then it spells it out .
and if it isn 't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
so let 's bring up a video of that .
thanks . so . and this project here , i was working with the great abstract vocalist , jaap blonk .
and he is a world expert in performing " the ursonate , " which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem by kurt schwitters , written in the 1920s ,
which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense .
and it 's almost impossible to perform .
but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it .
and in this project we 've developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
so these are our live subtitles , that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of " the ursonate " -- fortunately jaap does too , very well --
and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is .
so all the text you 're going to see is real-time generated by the computer , visualizing what he 's doing with his voice .
here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him .
okay . so ...
the full videos are online if you are interested .
i got a split reaction to that during the live performance ,
because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron ,
because usually there is someone making them afterwards .
and then a bunch of people who were like , " what 's the big deal ?
i see subtitles all the time on television . "
you know ? they don 't imagine the person in the booth , typing it all .
so in addition to the full body , and in addition to the voice , another thing that i 've been really interested in , most recently , is the use of the eyes , or the gaze , in terms of how people relate to each other .
it 's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that 's communicated with the eyes .
and it 's one of the most interesting technical challenges that 's very currently active in the computer sciences :
being able to have a camera that can understand , from a fairly big distance away , how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you 're interested in , and where your attention is directed .
so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
and so i 've been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
and basically to ask the questions : what if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
how could it respond , in a way , to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we 're looking at it ?
and what could it do if it could look back at us ?
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
in the first one which i 'm going to show you , called eyecode , it 's a piece of interactive software in which , if we read this little circle , " the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer . "
the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation .
so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .
so let 's run this and see if it works .
okay . ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
there is just a little test screen that shows that it 's working .
and what i 'm just going to do is -- i 'm going to hide that . and you can see here that what it 's doing is it 's recording my eyes every time i blink .
hello ? and i can ... hello ... okay .
and no matter where i am , what 's really going on here is that it 's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .
and if i get really far away i 'm blurry .
you know , you 're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way .
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you 'll see these nice crisp eyes .
you can think of it as a way of , sort of , typing , with your eyes .
and what you 're typing are recordings of your eyes as you 're looking at other peoples ' eyes .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at , as you see who 's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .
so i 'll just add a couple more . blink . blink .
and you can see , just once again , how it 's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it 's blinking .
alright . let 's leave that .
so that 's this kind of recursive observation system .
thank you .
the last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics -- for me , new for me .
it 's called opto-isolator .
and i 'm going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
in this case , the opto-isolator is blinking in response to one 's own blinks .
so it blinks one second after you do .
this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials .
just one eye , looking at you , and eliminating everything else about a face ,
but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of , as an element .
and at the same time , it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors .
like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy ,
or things like that .
okay . so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout .
it 's an eight-foot snout , with a googly eye .
and inside it 's got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed , from a friend .
it helps to have good friends .
i 'm at carnegie mellon ; we 've got a great robotics institute there .
i 'd like to show you thing called snout , which is --
the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it 's continually surprised to see you .
the idea is that basically --
if it 's constantly like " huh ? ... huh ? "
that 's why its other name is doubletaker , taker of doubles .
it 's always kind of doing a double take : " what ? "
and the idea is basically , can it look at you and make you feel as if like , " what ? is it my shoes ? "
" got something on my hair ? " here we go . alright .
checking him out ...
for you nerds , here 's a little behind-the-scenes .
it 's got a computer vision system ,
and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most .
those are its targets .
up there is the skeleton ,
which is actually what it 's trying to do . it 's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you , and it 's interested in looking at you .
thank you very much . that 's all i 've got for today .
and i 'm really happy to be here . thank you so much .

evan williams on listening to twitter users
four years ago , on the ted stage , i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo .
and because of that announcement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deciding to become ceo of that company -- whereas i was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring . one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey , and a year later we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo , and jack presented an idea he 'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .
we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched twitter as a side project at odeo .
now , it 's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup , where focus is so critical , but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company , thinking it was just a little thing we 'd do on the side , and it ended up taking over not only the company , but my life over the next five or six years .
so i learned to follow hunches even though you can 't necessarily justify them or know where they 're going to go .
and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter , time after time .
so , for those of you unfamiliar , twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept .
you say what you 're doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
if they 're really interested , they get the update as a text message on their cell phone .
so , for instance , i may twitter right now that i 'm giving a talk at ted .
it 's a normal everyday thing .
and in my case , when i hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
now , the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
it is by sharing these moments as they 're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch , despite distance , and in real time .
this was the primary use we saw for twitter from the beginning , and what got us excited .
what we didn 't anticipate was the many , many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system . one of the things we realized was how important twitter could be during real-time events .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
but it wasn 't just individuals .
the l.a. times actually turned to twitter to dispense information as well , and put a twitter feed on the front page , and the l.a. fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well . at this event , dozens of people are twittering and thousands of people are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what 's happening . among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses , from marketing and communications and predictable things , to an insanely popular korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around l.a. and twitters where it stops , causing a line to form around the block . politicians have recently begun twittering . in fact , there are 47 members of congress who currently have twitter accounts . and they 're tweeting , in some cases , from behind closed-door sessions with the president . in this case , this guy 's not liking what he 's hearing .
the president himself is our most popular twitter user , although his tweets have dropped off as of late , while senator mccain 's have picked up .
as have this guy 's .
twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium :
you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you 're interested in .
one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message . so , this syntax , the " @ username " that shaquille o 'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans , was completely invented by users , and we didn 't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier .
this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
another is via the api .
we built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
we currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send twitter updates -- interfaces for mac , windows , your iphone , your blackberry --
as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water . probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize . summize built a twitter search engine . and they tapped into the fact that , if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them , you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it 's going on . this really changed how we perceived twitter . for instance , here 's what people are saying about ted . this is another way that our mind was shifted , and twitter wasn 't what we thought it was . we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product . this not only lets you view twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta . some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas -- where it was , and how much it cost -- and then appended the keyword " # atlgas " so that other people search for that and find gas themselves . and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends . it 's happened more and more lately , whether it 's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or for a family in crisis . people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasions . it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information , more good things happen . i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
i 've learned to follow the hunch , but never assume where it will go . thanks .
chris anderson : we 're not quite done yet .
so , look , if we could have this screen live ...
this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they 've been to an event . it 's totally intimidating .
so , this would be the twitter search screen . let 's type a couple of random words into twitter .
for example : " evan williams . " ... " give people more information and follow your hunch @ # ted . "
... " currently listening to evan williams . "
oh ... " evan williams is just dying on stage here at ted .
worst talk ever ! " evan williams : nice . thanks .
ca : just kidding . but , literally in the eight minutes he was talking , there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk .
so he 'll see every aspect of the reaction : the fact that barack obama is the biggest twitterer , the fact that it came out of ted ... i don 't think there 's any other way of getting instant feedback that way . you have build something very fascinating , and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it .
so , thank you very much , evan .
that was very interesting . ew : thank you .

chimamanda adichie : the danger of a single story
i 'm a storyteller .
and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call " the danger of the single story . "
i grew up on a university campus in eastern nigeria .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
so i was an early reader , and what i read were british and american children 's books .
i was also an early writer ,
and when i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read , i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading :
all my characters were white and blue-eyed ,
they played in the snow , they ate apples ,
how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
now , this despite the fact that i lived in nigeria .
i had never been outside nigeria .
we didn 't have snow , we ate mangoes ,
and we never talked about the weather , because there was no need to .
my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer .
never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
but that is another story .
what this demonstrates , i think , is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story , particularly as children .
because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign , i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify .
things changed when i discovered african books .
there weren 't many of them available , and they weren 't quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
but because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
i realized that people like me , girls with skin the color of chocolate , whose kinky hair could not form ponytails , could also exist in literature .
i started to write about things i recognized .
now , i loved those american and british books i read .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature .
so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this : it saved me from having a single story of what books are .
i come from a conventional , middle-class nigerian family .
my father was a professor .
my mother was an administrator .
and so we had , as was the norm , live-in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy .
his name was fide .
the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
and when i didn 't finish my dinner my mother would say , " finish your food ! don 't you know ? people like fide 's family have nothing . "
so i felt enormous pity for fide 's family .
then one saturday we went to his village to visit ,
and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made .
i was startled .
it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
their poverty was my single story of them .
years later , i thought about this when i left nigeria to go to university in the united states .
i was 19 .
my american roommate was shocked by me .
she asked where i had learned to speak english so well , and was confused when i said that nigeria happened to have english as its official language .
she asked if she could listen to what she called my " tribal music , " and was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey .
she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .
what struck me was this : she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me .
her default position toward me , as an african , was a kind of patronizing , well-meaning pity .
my roommate had a single story of africa :
a single story of catastrophe .
in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way ,
no possibility of feelings more complex than pity ,
no possibility of a connection as human equals .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn 't consciously identify as african . but in the u.s. whenever africa came up people turned to me .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
but i did come to embrace this new identity ,
and in many ways i think of myself now as african .
although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country ,
the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago , in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in " india , africa and other countries . "
so after i had spent some years in the u.s. as an african , i began to understand my roommate 's response to me . if i had not grown up in nigeria , and if all i knew about africa were from popular images , i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes , beautiful animals , and incomprehensible people , fighting senseless wars , dying of poverty and aids , unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind , white foreigner .
i would see africans in the same way that i , as a child , had seen fide 's family .
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
now , here is a quote from the writing of a london merchant called john locke , who sailed to west africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage .
after referring to the black africans as " beasts who have no houses , " he writes , " they are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . "
now , i 've laughed every time i 've read this .
and one must admire the imagination of john locke .
but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling african stories in the west :
a tradition of sub-saharan africa as a place of negatives , of difference , of darkness , of people who , in the words of the wonderful poet rudyard kipling , are " half devil , half child . "
and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not " authentically african . "
now , i was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel , that it had failed in a number of places ,
but i had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called african authenticity .
in fact i did not know what african authenticity was .
the professor told me that my characters were too much like him , an educated and middle-class man .
my characters drove cars .
they were not starving .
therefore they were not authentically african .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was tense ,
and there were debates going on about immigration .
and , as often happens in america , immigration became synonymous with mexicans .
there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
i remember walking around on my first day in guadalajara , watching the people going to work , rolling up tortillas in the marketplace , smoking , laughing .
i remember first feeling slight surprise .
and then i was overwhelmed with shame .
i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant .
i had bought into the single story of mexicans and i could not have been more ashamed of myself .
so that is how to create a single story , show a people as one thing , as only one thing , over and over again , and that is what they become .
it is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power .
there is a word , an igbo word , that i think about whenever i think about the power structures of the world , and it is " nkali . "
it 's a noun that loosely translates to " to be greater than another . "
like our economic and political worlds , stories too are defined by the principle of nkali :
how they are told , who tells them , when they 're told , how many stories are told , are really dependent on power .
power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person , but to make it the definitive story of that person .
the palestinian poet mourid barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with , " secondly . "
start the story with the arrows of the native americans , and not with the arrival of the british , and you have an entirely different story .
start the story with the failure of the african state , and not with the colonial creation of the african state , and you have an entirely different story .
i recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel .
i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers .
now , obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation .
but it would never have occurred to me to think that just because i had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all americans .
this is not because i am a better person than that student , but because of america 's cultural and economic power , i had many stories of america .
i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill .
i did not have a single story of america .
when i learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful , i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me .
but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
but i also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
my cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
i grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education , so that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries .
and so , as a child , i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table , then margarine disappeared , then bread became too expensive , then milk became rationed .
and most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
all of these stories make me who i am .
but to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me .
the single story creates stereotypes ,
and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
they make one story become the only story .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes :
there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo
and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
but there are other stories that are not about catastrophe ,
and it is very important , it is just as important , to talk about them .
i 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
it makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult .
it emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar .
so what if before my mexican trip i had followed the immigration debate from both sides , the u.s. and the mexican ?
what if my mother had told us that fide 's family was poor and hardworking ?
what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world ?
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls " a balance of stories . "
what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher , mukta bakaray , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don 't read literature .
he disagreed . he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
shortly after he published my first novel i went to a tv station in lagos to do an interview ,
and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , " i really liked your novel . i didn 't like the ending .
now you must write a sequel , and this is what will happen ... "
and she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel .
i was not only charmed , i was very moved .
here was a woman , part of the ordinary masses of nigerians , who were not supposed to be readers .
she had not only read the book , but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel .
now , what if my roommate knew about my friend fumi onda , a fearless woman who hosts a tv show in lagos , and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget ?
what if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the lagos hospital last week ?
what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music ,
talented people singing in english and pidgin , and igbo and yoruba and ijo , mixing influences from jay-z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband 's consent before renewing their passports ?
what if my roommate knew about nollywood , full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds ,
films so popular that they really are the best example of nigerians consuming what they produce ?
what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
every time i am home i am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most nigerians : our failed infrastructure , our failed government ,
but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government , rather than because of it .
i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer ,
and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
my nigerian publisher and i have just started a non-profit called farafina trust ,
and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist
and providing books for state schools that don 't have anything in their libraries ,
and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , in reading and writing , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
stories matter .
many stories matter .
stories have been used to dispossess and to malign ,
but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
stories can break the dignity of a people ,
but stories can also repair that broken dignity .
the american writer alice walker wrote this about her southern relatives who had moved to the north .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind :
" they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . "
i would like to end with this thought : that when we reject the single story , when we realize that there is never a single story about any place , we regain a kind of paradise .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / noreena _ hertz _ how _ to _ use _ experts _ and _ when _ not _ to.html
we make important decisions every day -- and we often rely on experts to help us decide . but , says economist noreena hertz , relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous . she calls for us to start democratizing expertise -- to listen not only to " surgeons and ceos , but also to shop staff . "
business , choice , culture , economics

noreena hertz : how to use experts -- and when not to
it 's monday morning .
in washington , the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office , assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda in yemen .
at number 10 downing street , david cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession .
in madrid , maria gonzalez is standing at the door , listening to her baby crying and crying , trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it .
and i am sitting by my father 's bedside in hospital , trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , " you must make him drink today , " -- my father 's been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , i might actually kill him .
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives ,
and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .
we talk things over with our friends , we scour the internet , we search through books . but still , even in this age of google and tripadvisor and amazon recommends , it 's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters .
because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity , we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own .
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
but i believe that this is a big problem , a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society , as a culture and as individuals .
it 's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have .
the problem lies with us : we 've become addicted to experts .
we 've become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
we 've surrendered our power , trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .
this is no exaggeration .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to experts speak .
the results were quite extraordinary .
as they listened to the experts ' voices , the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off .
it literally flat-lined .
and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice , however right or wrong .
but experts do get things wrong .
did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10 ?
did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself , you 're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you ?
and then there 's , of course , the example that we 're all too aware of : financial experts getting it so wrong that we 're living through the worst recession since the 1930s .
for the sake of our health , our wealth and our collective security , it 's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on .
and i 'm saying this as an economist who , over the past few years , has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why ,
but also -- and i 'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself , as a professor , as somebody who advises prime ministers , heads of big companies , international organizations , but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change , that we need to become more open-minded , more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view .
so in order to help you understand where i 'm coming from , let me bring you into my world , the world of experts .
now there are , of course , exceptions , wonderful , civilization-enhancing exceptions . but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
alan greenspan 's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on , not challenged by his peers , until after the crisis , of course .
you see , we also learn that experts are located , are governed , by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in victorian england , say , who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire , or the psychiatrists in the united states who , up until 1973 , were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness .
and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they 're about to bring by market .
the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study .
and we 've also got to be aware that experts , of course , also make mistakes .
they make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
a common thinking error of radiologists , for example -- when they look at ct scans -- is that they 're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient 's problem to be .
so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia , say , what happens is that , if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan , they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient 's lungs .
i 've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts .
these are , of course , not the only insights i could share , but i hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them , why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on .
but how can we do this ?
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
first , we 've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
this doesn 't mean having to get a ph.d. in every single subject , you 'll be relieved to hear .
but it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
why was it that , when i had an operation , my doctor said to me , " beware , ms. hertz , of hyperpyrexia , " when he could have just as easily said , " watch out for a high fever . "
you see , being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs , their equations , their forecasts , their prophecies , and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like : what are the assumptions that underpin this ?
what is the evidence upon which this is based ?
what has your investigation focused on ?
and what has it ignored ?
it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
it seems that they 've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world 's population are women .
and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don 't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they 're actively harmful for women to take .
being a rebel is about recognizing that experts ' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed .
second , we need to create the space for what i call " managed dissent . "
if we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we 're bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views . all the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter .
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
and that 's why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent .
google ceo eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .
in meetings , he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed , looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion , trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion , so that they have dissent within the room .
managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement , discord and difference .
but we need to go even further .
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
the conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees , fancy titles , diplomas , best-selling books -- high-status individuals .
but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo 's , but also shop-girls -- yeah .
best buy , the consumer electronics company , gets all its employees -- the cleaners , the shop assistants , the people in the back office , not just its forecasting team -- to place bets , yes bets , on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before christmas , on whether customers ' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company , on whether a project will come in on time .
by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , best buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in china -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time .
because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .
it turned out that they were aware , as no one else within the company was , of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts , nor the experts on the ground in china , were even aware of .
the strategies that i have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent , taking experts on , democratizing expertise , rebellious strategies -- are strategies that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing , complex , difficult times .
for if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on , if we challenge experts , if we 're skeptical , if we devolve authority , if we are rebellious , but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance , uncertainty and doubt , and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too , we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century .
for now , more than ever , is not the time to be blindly following , blindly accepting , blindly trusting .
now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using experts to help us figure things out , for sure -- i don 't want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and , of course , also our own .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / shai _ agassi _ on _ electric _ cars.html
forget about the hybrid auto -- shai agassi says it 's electric cars or bust if we want to impact emissions . his company , better place , has a radical plan to take entire countries oil-free by 2020 .

shai agassi 's bold plan for electric cars
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
that 's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a davos afternoon about four years ago .
it never left my brain .
and i started playing with it more like a puzzle .
the original thought i had : this must be ethanol .
so i went out and researched ethanol ,
and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country .
about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen , until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth , which is , you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car , if you use hydrogen .
so that is not going to be the path to go .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse .
not how do you build one car ,
but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population ?
the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today .
so one , it has to be more convenient than a car .
and two , it has be more affordable than today 's cars .
affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan , right ?
alright ? that 's not something that we can finance or buy today .
and convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
and so the thought that i started with was how do you do this , still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair , no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .
how do you do it within the economics that we have today ?
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
and not from the power of an edict down .
on a random visit to tesla on some afternoon , i actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic " batteries not included . "
now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up .
the network has two components in them .
first component is you charge the car whenever you stop --
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours .
if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute .
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
now it sounds crazy . but in some places around the world , like scandinavia , you already have that .
if you park your car and didn 't plug in the heater , when you come back you don 't have a car . it just doesn 't work .
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension .
see we 're bound by today 's technology on batteries , which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations .
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people .
but you never want to get stuck .
so what we added is a second element to our network , which is a battery swap system .
you drive . you take your depleted battery out .
a full battery comes on . and you drive on .
you don 't do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
and a plate comes up , holds your battery , takes it out , puts it back in , and
within two minutes you 're back on the road
and you can go again .
if you had charge spots everywhere , and you had battery swap stations everywhere , how often would you do it ? and it ends up that you 'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it 's an inconvenience .
then we looked at the question of the affordability .
we looked at the question , what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car .
what is the cost of that battery ?
everybody tells us batteries are so expensive .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electrons , something interesting happens .
we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
you have the crude oil .
and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline .
the battery in this sense , is the crude oil .
we have a battery bay . it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .
but the crude oil is replaced with a battery . just it doesn 't burn . it consumes itself
step after step after step .
it has 2,000 life cycles these days .
and so it 's sort of a mini well .
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well , for the life of the car .
nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car .
in a sense what we 've done is we 've created a new consumable .
you , today , buy gasoline miles .
and we created electric miles .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
today 2010 , in volume , when we come to market , it is eight cents a mile .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer
environment we 're in in the u.s .
20 miles per gallon that 's a buck 50 , a buck 60 a gallon .
that 's cheaper than today 's gasoline , even in the u.s .
in europe where taxes are in place , that 's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
but e-miles follow moore 's law .
they go from eight cents a mile in 2010 , to four cents a mile in 2015 , to two cents a mile by 2020 .
why ? because batteries life cycle improve -- a bit of improvement on energy density , which reduces the price .
and these prices are actually with clean electrons .
we do not use any electrons that come from coal .
so in a sense this is an absolute zero-carbon , zero-fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 .
now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 , which is our desire .
imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road .
that is an 80 cent gallon .
an 80 cent gallon means , if the entire pacific would convert to crude oil , and we 'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it , they still can 't compete with two cents a mile .
that 's a new economic factor , which is fascinating to most people .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
that 's how i solved it in my head . it was a white paper i handed out to governments .
and some governments told me that it 's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things .
until i got to the true young global leader , shimon peres , president of israel ,
and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me .
first he let me go to the prime minister of the country ,
who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars -- that 's what we needed in israel --
i 'll give you country to invest the 200 million into .
peres thought that was a great idea .
so we went out , and we looked at all the car companies .
we sent letters to all the car companies .
three of them never showed up . one of them asked us
if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
he said hybrids are like mermaids .
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
and ghosn came up and said , " i have the car , mr. peres ; i will build you the cars . "
and actually true to form , renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume -- mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars .
it 's the first mass-volume electric car ,
zero-emission electric car in the market .
i was running , as chris said , to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said , " well won 't you run this project ? "
and i said , " i 'm ready for ceo " and he said , " oh no no no no no . you 've got to explain to me , what is more important than saving your country and saving the world , that you would go and do ? "
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .
we then decided to scale it up .
we went to other countries . as i said we went to denmark .
and denmark set this beautiful policy ; it 's called the iq test .
it 's inversely proportional to taxes .
they put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars
and zero tax on zero-emission cars .
so if you want to buy a gasoline car in denmark , it costs you about 60,000 euros .
if you buy our car it 's about 20,000 euros .
if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country .
we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands .
i know most people don 't think of israel as a small island ,
but israel is an island -- it 's a transportation island .
if your car is driving outside israel it 's been stolen .
if you 're thinking about it in terms of islands , we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find ,
and that was australia . the third country we announced was australia .
it 's got three centers -- in brisbane , in melbourne , in sydney -- and one freeway , one electric freeway that connects them .
the next island was not too hard to find , and that was hawaii .
we decided to come into the u.s. and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn 't need any range extension .
hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
the second one was the san francisco bay area
where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors .
he decided that he 's going to take over the state , unofficially , and then officially ,
and then created this beautiful region one policy .
in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses , but you also have the perfect range extender .
it 's called the other car .
as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
why is this a big issue ?
and the most fascinating thing we 've learned is that , when you have small problems on the individual level , like the price of gasoline to drive every morning .
you don 't notice it , but when the aggregate comes up you 're dead . alright ?
so the price of oil , much like lots of other curves that we 've seen , goes along a depletion curve .
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .
and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
you think , well it 's been up , it 's been down , its been up , it 's going to keep on going up and down .
here is the problem : at 147 dollars a barrel , which we were in six months ago , the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil .
then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --
sometimes it 's 40 , sometimes it 's 50 .
now we 're running a stimulus package .
it 's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package .
we 're going to revive the economy . hopefully it happens between now and 2015 , somewhere in that space .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now .
that 's another 30 percent demand on oil .
that is another 25 million barrels a day .
that 's all the u.s. usage today .
in other words at some point when we 've recovered we go up to the peak .
and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel .
we take our money and we give it away .
you know what happens at that point ?
we go back down . it 's going to go up and down .
and the downs are going to be much longer
and the ups are going to be much shorter .
and that 's the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we 've got .
now we actually looked at what the answer would be .
right ? remember in the campaign : one million hybrid cars by 2015 .
that is 0.5 percent of the u.s. oil consumption .
that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world .
that won 't do much difference .
we looked at an mit study : ten million electric cars on the global roads .
ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then .
that is the most pessimistic number you can have .
it 's also the most optimistic number
because it means we will scale this industry from 100 thousand cars is 2011 , to 10 million cars by 2016 -- 100 x growth in less than five years .
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .
we have 10 million cars by region .
that 's an enormous amount of cars .
china is adding those cars -- india , russia , brazil .
we have all these regions .
europe has solved it . they just put a tax on gasoline .
they 'll be the first in line to get off
because their prices are high .
china solves it by an edict . at some point they 'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city , and that will be it .
the indians don 't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we 're the only ones who don 't have the price set right .
we don 't have the industry set right .
we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s .
now where is the car industry on that ?
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
they basically looked at it and said , " car 1.0 we 'll solve everything within the car itself . "
no infrastructure , no problem .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
all this stuff that happens around .
we are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 -- a whole new market , a whole new business model .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you 'll pay for the miles .
and some of it will go back to the car maker .
some of it will go back to your own pocket .
but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars .
you 're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .
in denmark , we will drive all the cars in denmark from windmills , not from oil .
in israel , we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel .
and people said , " oh that 's a very very large space that you 're asking for . "
and we said , " what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
and they said , " we tried . there isn 't any . "
we said , " no no , but what if we prove it ? "
and they said , " well you can dig . " and we decided to dig up ,
instead of digging down .
these are perfect matches to one another .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years .
that 's one percent a year .
now when we 're looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
and those are not 20 percent by 2020 .
the two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --
and scale it infinity .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year
we can 't stop thinking of padding co2 .
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
one car emits four tons .
and actually 700 and change million cars today emit 2.8 billion tons of co2 .
that 's , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world 's co2 emissions .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we 're going to go to zero before the world ends .
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s .
i shared it with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr . , who is one of my idols .
i told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we 're going to send a man to the moon , and we 'll do it by the end of the decade .
we didn 't say we 're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
he actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
200 years ago , in parliament , in great britain , there was a long argument
over economy versus morality .
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --
25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the u.k. came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves .
and there was an argument . should we stop using slaves ?
and what would it do to our economy ?
and people said , " well we need to take time to do it .
let 's not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids
and keep the slaves .
and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery ,
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year .
and the u.k. had 100 years of economic growth .
we have to make the right moral decision .
we have to make it immediately .
we need to have presidential leadership
just like we had in israel that said we will end oil .
and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years , but within this presidential term
because if we don 't , we will lose our economy , right after we 'd lost our morality .
thank you all very much .

richard dawkins on militant atheism
that splendid music , the coming-in music -- " the elephant march " from " aida " -- is the music i 've chosen for my funeral -- -- and you can see why . it 's triumphal .
i won 't feel anything , but if i could , i would feel triumphal at having lived at all , and at having lived on this splendid planet , and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here in the first place , before not being here .
can you understand my quaint english accent ?
like everybody else , i was entranced yesterday by the animal session .
robert full and frans lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed .
the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of the mustang , " the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth . " now of course , we know that he didn 't really mean that , but in this country at the moment , you can 't be too careful .
i 'm a biologist , and the central theorem of our subject : the theory of design , darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .
in professional circles everywhere , it 's of course universally accepted .
in non-professional circles outside america , it 's largely ignored .
but in non-professional circles within america , it arouses so much hostility -- -- that it 's fair to say that american biologists are in a state of war .
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
if you want to know what i have to say about darwinism itself , i 'm afraid you 're going to have to look at my books , which you won 't find in the bookstore outside .
contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism , called " intelligent design , " or id .
don 't be fooled . there 's nothing new about id .
it 's just creationism under another name , rechristened -- i choose the word advisedly -- -- for tactical , political reasons .
the arguments of so-called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
there is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science , and i try to do all i can to help them , but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists .
they see us as rocking the boat , and you can understand why .
creationists , lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case , fall back on the popular phobia against atheism .
teach your children evolution in biology class , and they 'll soon move on to drugs , grand larceny and sexual pre-version .
in fact , of course , educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support of evolution .
this book , " finding darwin 's god , " by kenneth miller , is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know , and it 's all the more effective because it 's written by a devout christian .
people like kenneth miller could be called a " godsend " to the evolution lobby -- -- because they expose the lie that evolutionism is , as a matter of fact , tantamount to atheism . people like me , on the other hand , rock the boat .
but here , i want to say something nice about creationists .
it 's not a thing i often do , so listen carefully .
i think they 're right about one thing .
i think they 're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
i 've already said that many individual evolutionists , like the pope , are also religious , but i think they 're deluding themselves .
i believe a true understanding of darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith .
now , it may sound as though i 'm about to preach atheism , and i want to reassure you that that 's not what i 'm going to do .
in an audience as sophisticated as this one , that would be preaching to the choir .
no , what i want to urge upon you --
-- instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism .
but that 's putting it too negatively .
if i was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith , i would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science , and indeed science generally , but evolution in particular , to inspire and enthrall , precisely because it is atheistic .
now , the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things .
statistical improbability in the direction of good design -- " complexity " is another word for this .
the standard creationist argument -- there is only one ; they all reduce to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability .
living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance ; therefore , they must have had a designer .
this argument of course , shoots itself in the foot .
any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself , and that 's before we even start on the other things he 's expected to do , like forgive sins , bless marriages , listen to prayers --
favor our side in a war --
-- disapprove of our sex lives and so on .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can 't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex , thereby simply compounding the problem .
darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
essentially , it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .
but here , i only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant , so parsimonious , so powerful , so economically powerful .
it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge .
the god theory is not just a bad theory .
it turns out to be , in principle , incapable of doing the job required of it .
so , returning to tactics and the evolution lobby , i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do .
my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby .
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion ,
and i 'm going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams , a dear friend who , if he never came to ted , certainly should have been invited .
richard dawkins : he was . good . i thought he must have been .
he begins this speech which was tape-recorded in cambridge shortly before he died .
he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof , and then he goes on .
i quote , " religion doesn 't seem to work like that .
it has certain ideas at the heart of it , which we call ' sacred ' or ' holy . ' what it means is : here is an idea or a notion that you 're not allowed to say anything bad about .
you 're just not . why not ? because you 're not .
why should it be that it 's perfectly legitimate to support the republicans or democrats , this model of economics versus that , macintosh instead of windows , but to have an opinion about how the universe began , about who created the universe -- no , that 's holy .
so , we 're used to not challenging religious ideas and it 's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it . " he meant me , not that one .
" everybody gets absolutely frantic about it , because you 're not allowed to say these things , yet when you look at it rationally , there is no reason why those ideas shouldn 't be as open to debate as any other , except that we 've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn 't be . " and that 's the end of the quote from douglas .
in my view , not only is science corrosive to religion ; religion is corrosive to science .
it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial , supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp .
it teaches them to accept authority , revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .
there 's douglas adams , magnificent picture from his book , " last chance to see . "
now , there 's a typical scientific journal , the quarterly review of biology .
and i 'm going to put together , as guest editor , a special issue on the question , " did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs ? "
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , " iridium layer at the k-t boundary , potassium-argon dated crater in yucatan , indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
perfectly ordinary scientific paper .
now , the next one , " the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction " -- -- ... " that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
" it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
" professor hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith " -- -- ... " that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
" professor hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . "
that 's inconceivable , of course .
but suppose --
-- in 1987 , a reporter asked george bush , sr. whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists .
mr. bush 's reply has become infamous .
" no , i don 't know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
this is one nation under god . " bush 's bigotry was not an isolated mistake , blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted .
he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal .
he really meant it .
more to the point , he knew it posed no threat to his election , quite the contrary .
democrats as well as republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected . both parties invoke " one nation under god . "
what would thomas jefferson have said ?
incidentally , i 'm not usually very proud of being british , but you can 't help making the comparison .
in practice , what is an atheist ?
an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh the way any decent christian feels about thor or baal or the golden calf .
as has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . some of us just go one god further .
and however we define atheism , it 's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic , unelectable non-citizen .
nevertheless , it 's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as mr. hitler or miss beelzebub .
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way-out minority .
natalie angier wrote a rather sad piece in the new yorker , saying how lonely she felt as an atheist .
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority , but actually , how do american atheists stack up numerically ?
the latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading .
christianity , of course , takes a massive lion 's share of the population , with nearly 160 million .
but what would you think was the second largest group , convincingly outnumbering jews with 2.8 million , muslims at 1.1 million , and hindus , buddhists and all other religions put together ?
the second largest group , of nearly 30 million , is the one described as non-religious or secular .
you can 't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of , for example , the jewish lobby .
the state of israel seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote , while at the same time consigning the non-religious to political oblivion .
this secular non-religious vote , if properly mobilized , is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote .
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
well , so much for quantity . how about quality ?
is there any correlation , positive or negative , between intelligence and tendency to be religious ?
the survey that i quoted , which is the aris survey , didn 't break down its data by socio-economic class or education , iq or anything else .
but a recent article by paul g. bell in the mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind .
mensa , as you know , is an international organization for people with very high iq .
and from a meta-analysis of the literature , bell concludes that , i quote , " of 43 studies carried out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief and one 's intelligence or educational level , all but four found an inverse connection .
that is , the higher one 's intelligence or educational level , the less one is likely to be religious . "
well , i haven 't seen the original 42 studies and i can 't comment on that meta-anaysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines .
and i know that there are , if i could put a little plug here , there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question , and i put the suggestion up -- for what it 's worth .
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group , namely , top scientists .
in 1998 , larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists , those who 'd been honored by election to the national academy of sciences , and among this select group , belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent .
about 20 percent are agnostic , and the rest could fairly be called atheists .
similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .
among biological scientists , the figures are even lower : 5.5 percent , only , believe in god . physical scientists : it 's 7.5 percent .
i 've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but i 'd be surprised if they were different .
so , we 've reached a truly remarkable situation , a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate .
a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe , which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally , is so abhorrent to the american electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public .
if i 'm right , this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it -- the intelligentsia -- unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs .
to put it bluntly , american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest .
i 'm not a citizen of this country , so i hope it won 't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done .
and i 've already hinted what that something is .
from what i 've seen of ted , i think this may be the ideal place to launch it .
again , i fear it will cost money .
we need a consciousness-raising , coming-out campaign for american atheists .
this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago , although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will .
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
on the contrary , they 'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children ,
the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product ,
the kinds of people who are sitting in this room .
there should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
there could be non-linearities , threshold effects .
when a critical mass has been attained , there 's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment .
and again , it will need money .
i suspect that the word " atheist " itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means , and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .
so , what other words might be used to smooth the path , oil the wheels , sugar the pill ? darwin himself preferred " agnostic " -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley , who coined the term .
darwin said , " i have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a god .
i think that generally an ' agnostic ' would be the most correct description of my state of mind . "
he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling .
aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism -- incidentally , giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate " das kapital " to darwin , which he didn 't . it was actually edward aveling .
what happened was that aveling 's mistress was marx 's daughter , and when both darwin and marx were dead , marx 's papers became muddled up with aveling 's papers and a letter from darwin saying , " my dear sir , thank you very much but i don 't want you to dedicate your book to me , " was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to marx , and that gave rise to this whole myth , which you 've probably heard .
it 's a sort of urban myth , that marx tried to dedicate " kapital " to darwin .
anyway , it was aveling , and when they met , darwin challenged aveling , " why do you call yourselves atheists ? "
" ' agnostic , ' " retorted aveling , " was simply ' atheist ' writ respectable , and ' atheist ' was simply ' agnostic ' writ aggressive . "
darwin complained , " but why should you be so aggressive ? "
darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote , " ripe for it . "
which is , of course , our old friend , the " don 't rock the boat " argument .
it 's not recorded whether aveling told darwin to come down off his high horse .
but in any case , that was more than 100 years ago . you think we might have grown up since then .
now , a friend , an intelligent lapsed jew , who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity , describes himself as a " tooth fairy agnostic . "
he won 't call himself an atheist because it 's , in principle , impossible to prove a negative , but agnostic on its own might suggest that god 's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence .
so , my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy , but it isn 't very likely , is it ? like god .
hence the phrase , " tooth fairy agnostic . " bertrand russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about mars .
you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about mars , but that doesn 't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence .
the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn 't stop at tooth fairies and teapots . it 's infinite .
if you want to believe one particular one of them -- unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or yahweh -- the onus is on you to say why .
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
we , who are atheists , are also a-fairiests and a-teapotists .
but we don 't bother to say so , and this is why my friend uses " tooth fairy agnostic " as a label for what most people would call atheist .
nonetheless , if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly , we 're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than " tooth fairy " or " teapot agnostic . "
so , how about " humanist " ?
this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place .
my problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism .
one of the things we 've learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins , some close , some distant .
and there are other possibilities like " naturalist , "
but that also has problems of confusion , because darwin would have thought naturalist -- " naturalist " means , of course , as opposed to " supernaturalist " --
and it is used sometimes --
darwin would have been confused by the other sense of " naturalist , " which he was , of course , and i suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism .
such people might be those belonging to the british lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile .
i think the best of the available alternatives for " atheist " is simply " non-theist . "
it lacks the strong connotation that there 's definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
it 's completely compatible with the god of the physicists .
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word " god , " they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep , mysterious part of physics which we don 't yet understand .
" non-theist " will do for all that , yet unlike " atheist , " it doesn 't have the same phobic , hysterical responses .
but i think , actually , the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word " atheism " itself , precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia .
critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word " atheist " than with the word " non-theist , " or some other non-confrontational word .
but if we did achieve it with that dread word -- " atheist " itself -- the political impact would be even greater .
now , i said that if i were religious , i 'd be very afraid of evolution . i 'd go further .
i would fear science in general if properly understood .
and this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting , more poetic , more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination .
as carl sagan , another recently dead hero , put it , " how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded , ' this is better than we thought !
the universe is much bigger than our prophet said , grander , more subtle , more elegant ? ' instead they say , ' no , no , no !
my god is a little god , and i want him to stay that way . '
a religion , old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths . "
now , this is an elite audience , and i would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious .
many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion , but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do .
if you 're one of them , and of course many of you may not be , but if you are one of them , i 'm asking you to stop being polite , come out and say so , and if you happen to be rich , give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference .
the religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations such as the templeton foundation and the discovery institute .
we need an anti-templeton to step forward .
if my books sold as well as stephen hawking 's books , instead of only as well as richard dawkins ' books , i 'd do it myself .
people are always going on about , " how did september the 11th change you ? "
well , here 's how it changed me .
let 's all stop being so damned respectful .
thank you very much .

ngozi okonjo-iweala : want to help africa ? do business here
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scared . i don 't know if i 'm scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this .
and i don 't have any smart technology for you to look at .
there are no slides , so you 'll just have to be content with me .
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .
already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time : the africa of hiv / aids , the africa of malaria , the africa of poverty , the africa of conflict , and the africa of disasters .
while it is true that those things are going on , there 's an africa that you don 't hear about very much .
and sometimes i 'm puzzled , and i ask myself why .
this is the africa that is changing , that chris alluded to .
this is the africa of opportunity .
this is the africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies .
and this is the africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this . that 's what i want to talk about today .
and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa .
on 15th of september 2005 , mr. diepreye alamieyeseigha , a governor of one of the oil-rich states of nigeria , was arrested by the london metropolitan police on a visit to london .
he was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family .
this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people : mr. nuhu ribadu .
alamieyeseigha was arraigned in london .
due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . but what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .
today , alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail .
this is a story about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders .
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they 'll benefit just a few of the elite .
and therefore , when you hear about the corrupt africa -- corruption all the time -- i want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries , and that some successes are emerging .
does it mean the problem is over ? the answer is no .
there 's still a long way to go , but that there 's a will there .
and that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight .
so when you hear about corruption , don 't just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can 't operate in any african country because of the overwhelming corruption . that is not the case .
there 's a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . in others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go .
but the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
the results are showing : independent monitoring by the world bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 african countries .
and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance .
that is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa .
that 's the image : african countries . but let me say this : if alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in london -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries ' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they 're able to do this , what is that ? is that not corruption ?
in this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
so when we talk about this kind of corruption , let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money 's going and what can be done to stop it .
i 'm working on an initiative now , along with the world bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries ' moneys -- to get that sent back .
because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .
the second thing i want to talk about is the will for reform .
africans , after -- they 're tired , we 're tired of being the subject of everybody 's charity and care .
we are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform .
and what is happening in many african countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us . we have to do it .
we can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
we have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information .
and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent , nigeria .
in fact , if you 're not in nigeria , you 're not in africa .
i want to tell you that .
one in four sub-saharan africans is nigerian , and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people . you 'll never be bored .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
and with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
not the international monetary fund . not the world bank , where i worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .
no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
we put together a program that would , one : get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in .
the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it 's inefficient and incompetent .
so we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
we -- as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?
having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
you couldn 't get it . you had to bribe .
you had to do everything to get your phone .
when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million gsm lines , and counting .
nigeria 's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world , after china . we are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms . and nobody knows , except a few smart people .
the smartest one , first to come in , was the mtn company of south africa .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country , with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita .
so the market is there .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies , and three or four others have come in .
but there 's a huge market out there , and people don 't know about it , or they don 't want to know .
so privatization is one of the things we 've done .
the other thing we 've also done is to manage our finances better .
because nobody 's going to help you and support you if you 're not managing your own finances well .
and nigeria , with the oil sector , had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well .
so what did we try to do ? we introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price .
before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in , because oil is the biggest , most revenue-earning sector in the economy : 70 percent of our revenues come from oil .
we de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
we didn 't know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
but what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
when they crashed , we crashed .
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
that smoothened out . we were able to save , just before i left , 27 billion dollars . whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when i arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
and that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
we brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
and we had gdp grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now .
so all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil .
agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
as telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and i could go on and on . and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
we have opportunities in solid minerals . we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored . and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible , that wouldn 't happen . so we 've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
there was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping malls as you know them here .
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
so , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . financial services : we had 89 banks . too many not doing their real business .
we consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
the banks -- these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside .
barclays bank of the u.k. is bringing in 500 million .
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
and i can go on . dollars , on and on , into the system .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
so in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
in tourism , in many african countries , a great opportunity .
and that 's what many people know east africa for : the wildlife , the elephants , and so on .
but managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important .
so what am i trying to say ? i 'm trying to tell you that there 's a new wave on the continent .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two-thirds of african countries have had multi-party democratic elections .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
i 'm trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum .
this is better than the performance of many oecd countries .
so it 's clear that things are changing .
conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible , of course , of which is darfur .
and , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected .
but you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries , not one country .
and if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there 's plenty of opportunity .
and i want to just make one point about this investment .
the best way to help africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
and the best way to do that is by helping create jobs .
there 's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children 's lives . that 's not what i 'm saying . that is fine .
but imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn 't that a wonderful opportunity ? isn 't that the way to go ?
and i want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women .
i have a cd here . i 'm sorry that i didn 't say anything on time .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
it says , " africa : open for business . " and this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year .
understand that the woman who made it is going to be in tanzania , where they 're having the session in june .
but it shows you africans , and particularly african women , who against all odds have developed businesses , some of them world-class .
one of the women in this video , adenike ogunlesi , making children 's clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business .
mixing african materials , such as we have , with materials from elsewhere .
so , she 'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs ,
has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal-mart .
for 10,000 pieces .
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
and the women are diligent . they are focused ; they work hard .
i could go on giving examples : beatrice gakuba of rwanda , who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the dutch auction in amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her .
however , many of these are starved for capital to expand , because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary . nobody thinks in terms of a market .
nobody thinks there 's opportunity .
but i 'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now , will miss it forever .
so if you want to be in africa , think about investing .
think about the beatrices , think about the adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
so i invite you to explore the opportunities .
when you go to tanzania , listen carefully , because i 'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent , for the people and for yourselves .
thank you very much .

yochai benkler on the new open-source economics
one of the problems of writing , and working , and looking at the internet is that it 's very hard to separate fashion from deep change .
and so , to start helping that , i want to take us back to 1835 .
in 1835 , james gordon bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in new york city .
and it cost about 500 dollars to start it , which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today .
by 15 years later , by 1850 , doing the same thing -- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper -- would come to cost two and a half million dollars .
10,000 , two and a half million , 15 years .
that 's the critical change that is being inverted by the net .
and that 's what i want to talk about today , and how that relates to the emergence of social production .
starting with newspapers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
now , the term " information society , " " information economy , " for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after
the industrial revolution . but in fact , for purposes of understanding what 's happening
today , that 's wrong . because for 150 years , we 've had an information economy .
it 's just been industrial ,
which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars , and later , more for the telegraph , and the radio transmitter , and the television , and eventually the mainframe .
and that meant they were market based , or they were government owned , depending on what kind of system they were in . and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years .
now , let me tell you a different story . around june 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bombshell .
the japanese had , for the first time , created the fastest supercomputer -- the nec earth simulator -- taking the primary from the u.s. , and about two years later -- this , by the way , is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running --
sigh of relief : ibm [ blue gene ] has just edged ahead of the nec earth simulator .
all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period , there 's another supercomputer running in the world -- seti @ home . four and a half million users around the world , contributing their leftover computer cycles , whenever their computer isn 't working , by running a screen saver , and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .
what this picture suggests to us is that we 've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it 's become less capital intensive -- that there 's less money that 's required -- but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
they 're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .
and computation , storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet .
what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution , the most important means , the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember , we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies , and there more than anywhere else , are in the hands of the population at large . this is completely different than what we 've seen since the industrial revolution . so we 've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we 've got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major input --
which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- is not something that 's the same or fungible among people .
any one of you who has taken someone else 's job , or tried to give yours to someone else , no matter how detailed the manual , you cannot transmit what you know , what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances .
in that we 're unique , and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine .
what 's the effect of this ? so , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software .
this is market share of apache web server -- one of the critical applications in web-based communications .
in 1995 , two groups of people said , " wow , this is really important , the web ! we need a much better web server ! "
one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided , you know , we really need this , we should write one , and what are we going to do with what -- well , we 're gonna share it ! and other people will be able to develop it .
the other was microsoft .
now , if i told you that 10 years later , the motley crew of people , who didn 't control anything that they produced , acquired 20 percent of the market and was the red line , it would be amazing ! right ?
think of it in minivans . a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota . right ?
but , in fact , of course , the story is it 's the 70 percent , including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application on which web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form , in direct competition with microsoft . not in a side issue -- in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the net .
software has done this in a way that 's been very visible , because it 's measurable . but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web .
so , nasa , at some point , did an experiment where they took images of mars that they were mapping , and they said , instead of having three or four fully trained ph.d.s doing this all the time , let 's break it up into small components , put it up on the web , and see if people , using a very simple interface , will actually spend five minutes here , 10 minutes there , clicking . after six months , 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in , which was , quote , " practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained ph.d. , " once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average .
now , if you have a little girl , and she goes and writes to -- well , not so little , medium little -- tries to do research on barbie .
and she 'll come to encarta , one of the main online encyclopedias . this is what you 'll find out about barbie . this is it , there 's nothing more to the definition , including , " manufacturers " -- plural -- " now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls , like this black barbie . " which is vastly better than what you 'll find in the encyclopedia.com , which is barbie , klaus .
on the other hand , if they go to wikipedia , they 'll find a genuine article -- and i won 't talk a lot about wikipedia , because jimmy wales is here -- but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica , differently written , including the controversies over body image and commercialization , the claims about the way in which she 's a good role model , etc .
another portion is not only how content is produced , but how relevance is produced .
the claim to fame of yahoo ! was , we hire people to look -- originally , not anymore -- we hire people to look at websites and tell you -- if they 're in the index , they 're good . this , on the other hand , is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project ,
each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about , to say , this is good . so , this is the open directory project , with 60,000 volunteers , each one spending a little bit of time , as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees . no one owns it , no one owns the output , it 's free for anyone to use and it 's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting .
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what 's relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page rank .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we 're going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- vanity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we 're going to count those , and count them up .
and again , here , you see barbie.com , but also , very quickly , adiosbarbie.com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture , which is the classic market-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relevance , basic human expression .
but remember , the computers were also physical . just physical materials -- our pcs -- we share them together . we also see this in wireless .
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license , they transmitted in an area , and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .
what we 're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we 're developing algorithms to let people own machines , like wi-fi devices , and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle : when i 'm listening , when i 'm not using , i can help you transfer your messages ;
and when you 're not using , you 'll help me transfer yours .
and this is not an idealized version . these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented , at least for public security .
if in 1999 i told you , let 's build a data storage and retrieval system .
it 's got to store terabytes . it 's got to be available 24 hours a day , seven days a week . it 's got to be available from anywhere in the world .
it has to support over 100 million users at any given moment . it 's got to be robust to attack , including closing the main index , injecting malicious files , armed seizure of some major nodes . you 'd say that would take years .
it would take millions . but of course , what i 'm describing is p2p file sharing .
right ? we always think of it as stealing music , but fundamentally , it 's a distributed data storage and retrieval system , where people , for very obvious reasons , are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something .
so , essentially what we 're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework . it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which
you could divide things . they could be market based , or non-market based ; they could be decentralized , or centralized .
the price system was a market-based and decentralized system .
if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them , you had firms , if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market .
it was too expensive to have decentralized social production , to have decentralized action in society . that was not about society itself .
that was , in fact , economic .
but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
not that it 's the first time that we do nice things to each other , or for each other , as social beings . we do it all the time .
it 's that it 's the first time that it 's having major economic impact .
what characterizes them is decentralized authority .
you don 't have to ask permission , as you do in a property-based system .
may i do this ? it 's open for anyone to create and innovate and share , if they want to , by themselves or with others , because property is one mechanism of coordination . but it 's not the only one .
instead , what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market : information flows to decide what are interesting problems ; who 's available and good for something ; motivation structures -- remember , money isn 't always the best motivator .
if you leave a $ 50 check after dinner with friends , you don 't increase the probability of being invited back .
and if dinner isn 't entirely obvious , think of sex .
it also requires certain new organizational approaches .
and in particular , what we 've seen is task organization .
you have to hire people who know what they 're doing .
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
five minutes , instead of watching tv ?
five minutes i 'll spend just because it 's interesting . just because it 's fun .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social relations .
so , a new social phenomenon is emerging .
it 's creating , and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .
peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry ; free and open source software taking market share from microsoft ; skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms ; wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .
but it 's also a new source of opportunities for businesses .
as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging , you have new opportunities . some of them are toolmakers .
instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they 'll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools . there 's a new set of values , a new set of things people value .
you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration .
like wikipedia , like the open directory project , you 're beginning to build platforms , and you see that as a model .
and you see surfers , people who see this happening , and in some sense build it into a supply chain , which is a very curious one . right ?
you have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
that 'll give me something i can use , and i 'm going to contract with someone .
i will deliver something based on what happens . it 's very scary -- that 's what google does , essentially .
that 's what ibm does in software services , and they 've done reasonably well .
so , social production is a real fact , not a fad .
it is the critical long-term shift caused by the internet .
social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some contexts , it 's even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower transaction costs . it 's sustainable and growing fast .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
so next time you open the paper , and you see an intellectual property decision , a telecoms decision , it 's not about something small and technical .
it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other , and the way information , knowledge and culture will be produced .
because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes , or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model , and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see .
thank you .

seth berkley explains how smart advances in vaccine design , production and distribution are bringing us closer than ever to eliminating a host of global threats -- from aids to malaria to flu pandemics .

seth berkley : hiv and flu -- the vaccine strategy
do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
most of us worry about things we can 't control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in haiti .
but what really threatens humanity ?
a few years ago , professor vaclav smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
he called these , " massively fatal discontinuities , " meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the earth .
but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold ,
but it can be a death sentence .
every year , 36,000 people in the united states die of seasonal flu .
in the developing world , the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher .
you know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus
and then we get a pandemic .
in 1918 , a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .
it spread like wildfire
and some died within hours of developing symptoms .
are we safer today ?
well , we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared , but this threat could reappear at any time .
the good news is that we 're at a moment in time when science , technology , globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility : the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth . we can do this .
we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines ,
and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
but with new or better vaccines for malaria , tb , hiv , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time .
so , i 'm here to trumpet vaccines for you . but first , i have to explain why they 're important
because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
when they work , they can make history , but after a while you can barely hear them .
now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children .
but when was the last time you worried about smallpox , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
we don 't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
now , it 's interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we 're still threatened by things like hiv and flu .
why is that ?
well , here 's the dirty little secret . until recently , we haven 't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
you took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
this worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural immunity .
so let 's explore how vaccines work .
they basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed .
now , when you get a viral infection , what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength , and that might be too late .
when you 're pre-immunized , what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .
so that 's really how vaccines work .
now , let 's take a look at a video that we 're debuting at ted , for the first time , on how an effective hiv vaccine might work .
narrator : a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader .
after hiv penetrates the body 's mucosal barriers , it infects immune cells to replicate .
the invader draws the attention of the immune system 's front-line troops .
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
memory cells generated by the hiv vaccine are activated when they learn hiv is present from the front-line troops .
these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
memory b cells turn into plasma cells , which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto hiv to prevent it from infecting cells , while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected .
the virus is defeated .
without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
by that time , the battle against hiv would already have been lost .
seth berkley : really cool video , isn 't it ?
the antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work .
so the real question then is : how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and hiv ?
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they 're always changing .
so let 's take a look at the flu virus .
in this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you .
and also , what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus .
when these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don 't know what they 're looking at anymore .
so that 's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
it 's also why in the spring , we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year , put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall .
even worse , the most common influenza -- influenza a -- also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans , and they can recombine in those particular animals .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
so , you 've got this situation :
in 2003 , we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
this year 's h1n1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in mexico .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
and so , in a sense , our luck is holding out , but you know , another wild bird could fly over at anytime .
now let 's take a look at hiv .
as variable as flu is , hiv makes flu look like the rock of gibraltar .
the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted .
it mutates furiously ,
it has decoys to evade the immune system ,
it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it
and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
here 's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv , a much wilder target . in the video a moment ago , you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells .
now realize that in a recently infected person , there are millions of these ships ; each one is just slightly different .
finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder .
now , in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids , we 've developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together .
these drugs aren 't cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv , at least for those who can access them .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in september , we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in thailand .
for the first time , we saw an aids vaccine work in humans -- albeit , quite modestly --
and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
but in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual .
now , what does this mean ?
we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models , they provide full protection from infection .
in addition , these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto ,
and what 's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
it 's like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it 's still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
so what we 've got is a situation .
the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine ,
and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
this strategy , working backwards
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research .
it 's called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
so think of it this way .
we 've got these new antibodies we 've identified , and we know that they latch onto many , many variations of the virus .
we know that they have to latch onto a specific part ,
so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part , present that through a vaccine , what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies .
and that would create a universal hiv vaccine .
now , it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site ,
and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this , we 'd love to hear about it .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
they 're currently making a cocktail -- an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat severe , overwhelming cases of flu .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
let me give you another example .
we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
notice these other , smaller protuberances .
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
now it turns out that these spots also don 't change much when the virus mutates .
if you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
so if this works in humans , what we 're talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn 't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
we really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
of course , the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it .
so to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
so i want you to think back a few months ago .
in june , the world health organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years .
the u.s. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by october 15th for the flu peak .
vaccines were promised to developing countries .
hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing .
so what happened ?
well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce them ,
in the early 1940s . it was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
for most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
luckily for us , we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances .
so today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
almost nothing has changed .
the system is reliable
but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
so , here 's an alarming thought .
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks , and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines .
so , dan [ barber ] , if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm , i know where to get them .
so right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains ,
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
but this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the u.s. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
and the process still takes more than half a year .
so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
well , with the new technologies emerging now , i hope we can say definitively , " yes . "
imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we 're currently spending now in the united states .
with a range of new technologies , we could .
here 's an example : a company i 'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system .
if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they 've created a very powerful flu fighter .
this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , e. coli . now , as you know , bacteria reproduce quickly --
it 's like making yogurt --
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories , in a few weeks , with no eggs , for a fraction of the cost of current methods .
so here 's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
and , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the e. coli method i just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
the developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're leapfrogging the west .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap , billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them .
now think of where this leads us .
new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
some day , perhaps soon , we 'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
luckily , this year 's flu was relatively mild .
i say , " luckily " in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated .
so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology ,
and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
instead of having vaclav smil 's " massively fatal discontinuity " of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
what the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
thank you very much .
chris anderson : thank you .
thank you . so , the science is changing .
in your mind , seth -- i mean , you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on , let 's start with hiv , for a game-changing vaccine that 's actually out there and usable ?
sb : the game change can come at any time , because the problem we have now is we 've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans ; we just need a better one .
and with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
ca : in your gut , do you think it 's probably going to be at least another five years ?
sb : you know , everybody says it 's 10 years , but it 's been 10 years every 10 years .
so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
ca : and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
sb : i think flu is different . i think what happened with flu is we 've got a bunch -- i just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
they look good . the problem has been that , what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that 's what we were comfortable with .
you also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
that 's what europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available ,
but , going back to what michael specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn 't really want that to happen .
ca : and malaria 's even further behind ?
sb : no , malaria , there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now .
it probably isn 't the perfect vaccine , but it 's moving along .
ca : seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
you 've been slaving away at this for more than a decade , and i salute you and your colleagues for what you do .
the world needs people like you . thank you .
sb : thank you .

george ayittey on cheetahs vs. hippos
well , first of all , let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact , ted global -- for putting this conference together .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
think african governments will put together a conference like this ?
you think the a.u. will put together a conference like this ?
even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid .
i would also like to pay homage and honor to the ted fellows june arunga , james shikwati , andrew , and the other ted fellows .
i call them the cheetah generation .
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .
they understand what accountability and democracy is .
they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them .
that 's the cheetah generation ,
and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs .
in contrast , of course , we have the hippo generation .
the hippo generation are the ruling elites . they are stuck in their intellectual patch . complaining about colonialism and imperialism , they wouldn 't move one foot .
if you ask them to reform the economies , they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo .
now , there are a lot of africans who are very angry , angry at the condition of africa .
now , we 're talking about a continent that is not poor .
it is rich in mineral resources , natural mineral resources .
but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty .
that 's what makes a lot of africans very angry . and in a way , africa is more than a tragedy , in more ways than one .
there 's another enduring tragedy , and that tragedy is that there are so many people , so many governments , so many organizations who want to help the people in africa . they don 't understand .
now , we 're not saying don 't help africa .
helping africa is noble .
but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd .
it 's like the blind leading the clueless .
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
africa 's begging-bowl leaks .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa ?
it 's taken out of africa .
that 's what the world bank says .
look at africa 's begging-bowl .
it leaks horribly .
there are people who think that we should pour more money , more aid into this bowl which leaks .
what are the leakages ?
corruption alone costs africa 148 billion dollars a year .
yes , put that aside .
capital flight out of africa , 80 billion a year .
put that aside .
let 's take food imports .
every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food . just add that up , all these leakages .
that 's far more than the 50 billion tony blair wants to raise for africa .
now , back in the 1960s africa not only fed itself , it also exported food .
not anymore .
we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong . you know it , i know it , but let 's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day here .
let 's move on , and flip over to the next chapter ,
and that 's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter .
the next chapter begins with first of all , asking ourselves this fundamental question , " whom do we want to help in africa ? "
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
now , the previous speaker before me , idris mohammed , indicated that we 've had abysmal leadership in africa .
that characterization , in my view , is even more charitable .
i belong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , " since 1960 , we 've had exactly 204 african heads of state , since 1960 . "
and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders , just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
everybody mentioned nelson mandela , of course .
kwame nkrumah , nyerere , kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin . i let that pass .
my point is , they couldn 't go beyond 15 .
even if they had been able to name me 20 , what does that tell you ?
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people .
and if you look at them , the slate of the post-colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads ,
swiss-bank socialists , crocodile liberators , vampire elites , quack revolutionaries .
now , this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries .
the second false premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people , serves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
there is one particular quote -- a lesotho chief once said that " here in lesotho , we 've got two problems : rats and the government . "
what you and i understand as a government doesn 't exist in many african countries .
in fact , what we call our governments are vampire states .
vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people .
government is the problem in africa .
a vampire state is the government -- -- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves , their cronies , and tribesmen and exclude everybody else .
the richest people in africa are heads-of-state and ministers , and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself .
where do they get their money ?
by creating wealth ?
no .
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
that 's not wealth creation . it 's wealth redistribution .
the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people , we must know where the african people are .
take any african economy .
an african economy can be broken up into three sectors .
there is the modern sector , there is the informal sector and the traditional sector .
the modern sector is the abode of the elites .
it 's the seat of government .
in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
it 's dysfunctional .
it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems , which the elites themselves don 't understand .
that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector , claiming innocent lives .
now the modern sector , of course , is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into .
more than 80 percent of ivory coast 's development went into the modern sector .
the other sectors , the informal and the traditional sectors , are where you find the majority of the african people ,
the real people in africa . that 's where you find them .
now , obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people , you go where the people are .
but that 's not what we did .
as a matter of fact , we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors .
now , traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture , which is one of the reasons why africa can 't feed itself , and that 's why it must import food .
all right , you cannot develop africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors .
and you can 't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .
these two sectors , let me describe to you , have their own indigenous institutions .
first one is the political system .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
if you look into their traditional systems , africans organize their states in two types .
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn 't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
these societies are the ibo , the somali , the kikuyus , for example . they have no chiefs .
the other ethnic groups , which did have chiefs , made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power .
in ashanti tradition , for example , the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders .
without the council the chief can 't pass any law , and if the chief doesn 't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .
if not , the people will abandon the chief , go somewhere else and set up a new settlement .
and even if you look in ancient african empires , they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle , which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority , decentralization of power .
now , this is what i have described to you . this is part of africa 's indigenous political heritage .
now , compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa .
it is a total far cry .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
it 's owned by extended families .
you see , in the west , the basic economic and social unit is the individual .
the american will say , " i am because i am , and i can damn well do anything i want , anytime . "
the accent is on the " i. "
in africa , the africans say , " i am , because we are . "
the " we " connotes community -- the extended family system .
the extended family system pools its resources together .
they own farms . they decide what to do , what to produce .
they don 't take any orders from their chiefs . they decide what to do .
and when they produce their crops , they sell the surplus on marketplaces .
when they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them .
so , in a nutshell , what we had in traditional africa was a free-market system .
there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent .
timbuktu was one great big market town .
kano , salaga -- they were all there .
even if you go to west africa , you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women .
so , it 's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .
the market is not alien to africa .
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .
nonsense .
and even then , what kind of socialism did they practice ?
the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss-bank socialism , which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa 's treasuries for deposit in switzerland .
that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries .
what do we do now ?
go back to africa 's indigenous institutions , and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors , the traditional sectors . that 's where you find the african people .
and i 'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector , about the boat-building that i , myself , tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in .
could you please show that ?
the men are going fishing in these small boats .
yes , it 's an enterprise .
this is by a local ghanaian entrepreneur , using his own capital .
he 's getting no assistance from the government , and he 's building a second , bigger boat .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .
it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians .
it also means that he will be able to generate wealth .
and then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy .
all that you need to do , all that the elites need to do , is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient .
now , it is not just this informal sector . there is also traditional medicine .
80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed . now , this is an area -- i mean , there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area .
this is where we need to mobilize africans , in the diaspora especially , to invest in this .
we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora , not only to go into the traditional sectors , but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within .
we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana .
and i know that with the cheetahs , we can take africa back one village at a time .
thank you very much .

stewart brand on squatter cities
basically , there 's a major demographic event going on .
and it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . so the world now is a map of connectivity .
it used to be that paris and london and new york were the largest cities .
what we have now is the end of the rise of the west . that 's over .
the aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
so what 's really going on ? well , villages of the world are emptying out .
the question is , why ?
and here 's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free , they said in renaissance germany . so some people go to places like shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
and these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
they 're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
they 're the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
they have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
one-sixth of the gdp in india is coming out of mumbai .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
what 's going on in the street in mumbai ?
al gore knows . it 's basically everything .
there 's no unemployment in squatter cities . everyone works .
one-sixth of humanity is there . it 's soon going to be more than that .
so here 's the first punch line :
cities have defused the population bomb .
and here 's the second punch line .
that 's the news from downtown . here it is in perspective .
stars have shined down on earth 's life for billions of years .
now we 're shining right back up .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / eli _ pariser _ beware _ online _ filter _ bubbles.html
as web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes , there 's a dangerous unintended consequence : we get trapped in a " filter bubble " and don 't get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview . eli pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy .
culture , global issues , journalism , politics , technology

eli pariser : beware online " filter bubbles "
mark zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed .
and the journalist was asking him , " why is this so important ? "
and zuckerberg said , " a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa . "
and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like .
so when i was growing up in a really rural area in maine , the internet meant something very different to me .
it meant a connection to the world .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online , and it 's invisible .
and if we don 't pay attention to it , it could be a real problem .
so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time -- my facebook page .
i 'm progressive , politically -- big surprise -- but i 've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives .
i like hearing what they 're thinking about ; i like seeing what they link to ; i like learning a thing or two .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , i was clicking more on my liberal friends ' links than on my conservative friends ' links .
and without consulting me about it , it had edited them out .
they disappeared .
so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the web .
google 's doing it too .
if i search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results .
even if you 're logged out , one engineer told me , there are 57 signals that google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using to where you 're located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results .
think about it for a second : there is no standard google anymore .
and you know , the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see .
you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's .
but a couple of weeks ago , i asked a bunch of friends to google " egypt " and to send me screen shots of what they got .
so here 's my friend scott 's screen shot .
and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot .
when you put them side-by-side , you don 't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are .
but when you do read the links , it 's really quite remarkable .
daniel didn 't get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results .
scott 's results were full of them .
and this was the big story of the day at that time .
that 's how different these results are becoming .
so it 's not just google and facebook either .
this is something that 's sweeping the web .
there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
yahoo news , the biggest news site on the internet , is now personalized -- different people get different things .
huffington post , the washington post , the new york times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways .
and this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see .
as eric schmidt said , " it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them . "
so i do think this is a problem .
and i think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what i call a filter bubble .
and your filter bubble is your own personal , unique universe of information that you live in online .
and what 's in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do .
but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in .
and more importantly , you don 't actually see what gets edited out .
so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix .
and they were looking at the netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
they enter the queue , they just zip right out .
so " iron man " zips right out , and " waiting for superman " can wait for a really long time .
what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
you know we all want to be someone who has watched " rashomon , " but right now we want to watch " ace ventura " for the fourth time .
so the best editing gives us a bit of both .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
and instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food .
what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong .
in a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society , there were these gatekeepers , the editors , and they controlled the flows of information .
and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was awesome .
but that 's not actually what 's happening right now .
what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they 're going to decide what we get to see and what we don 't get to see , then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance .
we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important -- this is what ted does -- other points of view .
and the thing is , we 've actually been here before as a society .
in 1915 , it 's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities .
then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
that , in fact , you couldn 't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information ,
that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
it wasn 't perfect , but it got us through the last century .
and so now , we 're kind of back in 1915 on the web .
and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing .
i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google -- larry and sergey -- people who have helped build the web as it is , and i 'm grateful for that .
but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility .
we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn 't .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
we need it to connect us all together .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
and it 's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one .
thank you .

al gore on averting climate crisis
thank you so much , chris . and it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice . i 'm extremely grateful .
i have been blown away by this conference , and i want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what i had to say the other night .
and i say that sincerely , partly because -- -- i need that ! put yourselves in my position !
i flew on air force two for eight years .
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !
i 'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me .
it 's a true story -- every bit of this is true .
soon after tipper and i left the -- -- white house -- -- we were driving from our home in nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of nashville -- driving ourselves .
i know it sounds like a little thing to you , but -- -- i looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me .
there was no motorcade back there .
you 've heard of phantom limb pain ? this was a rented ford taurus . it was dinnertime , and we started looking for a place to eat .
we were on i-40 . we got to exit 238 , lebanon , tennessee .
we got off the exit , started looking for a -- we found a shoney 's restaurant .
low-cost family restaurant chain , for those of you who don 't know it .
we went in and sat down at the booth , and the waitress came over ,
made a big commotion over tipper . she took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us ,
and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
she said " yes , that 's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper . " and the man said , " he 's come down a long way , hasn 't he ? " there 's been kind of a series of epiphanies .
the very next day , continuing a totally true story ,
i got on a g-5 to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria , in the city of lagos , on the topic of energy .
i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nashville .
i told it pretty much the same way i 've just shared it with you :
tipper and i were driving ourselves , shoney 's , low-cost family restaurant chain , what the man said -- they laughed .
i gave my speech , then went back out to the airport to fly back home .
i fell asleep on the plane , until during the middle of the night , we landed on the azores islands for refueling .
i woke up , they opened the door , i went out to get some fresh air ,
and i looked and there was a man running across the runway .
and he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , " call washington ! call washington ! "
and i thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in washington ?
then i remembered it could be a bunch of things .
but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in nigeria had already written a story about my speech .
and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states of america
-- it was printed in monterey , i checked . and the story began , " former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday , ' my wife tipper and i have opened a low-cost family restaurant , named shoney 's , and we are running it ourselves . ' " before i could get back to u.s. soil , david letterman and jay leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef 's hat , tipper was saying , " one more burger , with fries ! "
three days later , i got a nice , long , handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague bill clinton saying , " congratulations on the new restaurant , al ! "
we like to celebrate each other 's successes in life .
i was going to talk about information ecology .
but i was thinking that since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted , that maybe i could talk about that another time . chris anderson : it 's a deal !
al gore : i want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on .
what can you do about the climate crisis ? i want to start with -- i 'm going to show some new images , and i 'm going to recapitulate just four or five .
now , the slide show . i update the slide show every time i give it .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
it 's like beachcombing , you know ? every time the tide comes in and out , you find some more shells .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
this is just for the united states of america . historical average for january is 31 degrees . last month was 39.5 degrees .
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i 'm kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides , and then i 'm going to go into new material about what you can do .
but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these .
first of all , this is where we 're projected to go with the u.s. contribution to global warming , under business as usual . efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit . efficiency and conservation : it 's not a cost ; it 's a profit . the sign is wrong .
it 's not negative ; it 's positive . these are investments that pay for themselves .
but they are also very effective in deflecting our path .
cars and trucks -- i talked about that in the slideshow , but i want you to put it in perspective .
it 's an easy , visible target of concern , and it should be , but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .
cars and trucks are very significant , and we have the lowest standards in the world , and so we should address that . but it 's part of the puzzle .
other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks !
renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference , and with what vinod , and john doerr , and others , many of you here -- a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it .
carbon capture and sequestration -- that 's what ccs stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe .
not quite there yet .
ok . now , what can you do ? reduce emissions in your home .
most of these expenditures are also profitable .
insulation , better design , buy green electricity where you can .
i mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid . use light rail .
figure out some of the other options that are much better . it 's important .
be a green consumer . you have choices with everything you buy , between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis .
consider this . make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life . those of you who are good at branding , i 'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people .
it is easier than you think . it really is .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
it means : reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make , and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced . and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. there is a carbon calculator . participant productions convened , with my active involvement , the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator .
you can very precisely calculate what your co2 emissions are , and then you will be given options to reduce .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral . again , some of us have done that , and it 's not as hard as you think . integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations , whether you are from the technology , or entertainment , or design and architecture community .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
listen , if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance , don 't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management .
over time , people do what you pay them to do . and if they judge how much they 're going to get paid on your capital that they 've invested , based on the short-term returns , you 're going to get short-term decisions .
a lot more to be said about that .
become a catalyst of change . teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago , except it 's a lot more entertaining . and it comes out in may .
many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it .
consider sending somebody to nashville . pick well .
and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow , re-purposed , with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach ,
and -- it 's not just the slides , it 's what they mean . and it 's how they link together .
and so i 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it , en masse , in communities all across the country ,
and we 're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge .
working with larry lessig , it will be , somewhere in that process , posted with tools and limited-use copyrights , so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way .
where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm 's length from politics ?
it doesn 't mean that if you are a republican that i 'm trying to convince you to be a democrat . we need republicans as well . this used to be a bipartisan issue , and i know that in this group it really is . become politically active .
make our democracy work the way it 's supposed to work .
support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions , global warming pollution , and trading it . here 's why : as long as the united states is out of the world system , it 's not a closed system .
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who 's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
once it 's a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring .
we have to change the minds of the american people . because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
and in our modern country , the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did .
it 's now repetition of short , hot-button , 30-second , 28-second television ads .
we have to buy a lot of those ads .
let 's rebrand global warming , as many of you have suggested .
i like " climate crisis " instead of " climate collapse , " but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
somebody said the test we 're facing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination .
that 's really true . i said the other night , and i 'll repeat now : this is not a political issue .
again , the republicans here , this shouldn 't be partisan .
you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do .
this is an opportunity . not just this , but connected to the ideas that are here , to bring more coherence to them .
we are one .
thank you very much , i appreciate it .

the gulf oil spill dwarfs comprehension , but we know this much : it 's bad . carl safina scrapes out the facts in this blood-boiling cross-examination , arguing that the consequences will stretch far beyond the gulf -- and many so-called solutions are making the situation worse .
disaster relief , energy , environment , oceans , oil , pollution

carl safina : the oil spill 's unseen culprits , victims
this is the ocean as i used to know it .
and i find that since i 've been in the gulf a couple of times , i really kind of am traumatized
because whenever i look at the ocean now , no matter where i am , even where i know none of the oil has gone , i sort of see slicks ,
and i 'm finding that i 'm very much haunted by it .
but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context , not just about the oil eruption , but what it means and why it has happened .
first , just a little bit about me .
i 'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing
ever since i was a little kid ,
and because i did , i wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that i so loved .
and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing ,
and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly .
now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on , that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it .
it 's like you dipped a marble in water .
and the same thing with the atmosphere : if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
so we live on the most fragile , little soap bubble you can imagine ,
a very sacred soap bubble , but one that is very , very easy to affect .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere greatly .
carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up .
we 're warming the climate .
so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization .
beyond warming , we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so , and already affecting animals .
now in the laboratory , if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is -- not 8.1 , which is the normal ph of seawater -- but 7.5 , it dissolves in about three days .
if you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1 , put it in a ph of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies .
and already , commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places .
coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem .
so this really matters .
now , let 's take a little tour around the gulf a little bit .
one of the things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really aquatic people .
and they can handle water .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes . when the water goes down , they know what to do .
but when it 's something other than water , and their water habitat changes , they don 't have many options .
in fact , those entire communities really don 't have many options .
they don 't have another thing they can do .
they can 't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn 't one in their community .
if you go to the gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
you see a lot of oil on the ocean .
you see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
if you go to the site of the blowout , it looks pretty unbelievable .
it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car , and you just dumped it in the ocean .
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there 's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .
parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere .
it 's really messy .
if you go to the places where it 's just arriving , like the eastern part of the gulf , in alabama , there 's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach .
and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach . they 're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag .
they have thousands and thousands of plastic bags .
i don 't know what they 're going to do with all that stuff .
meanwhile , there are still people trying to use the beach .
they don 't see the little , tiny sign that says : " stay out of the water . "
their kids are in the water ; they 're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals . it 's a mess .
if you go to the place where the oil has been a while , it 's an even bigger mess .
and there 's basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
you see people who are really shell-shocked .
they are very hardworking people .
all they know about life is they get up in the morning , and if their engine starts , they go to work .
they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf .
they 're finding that their world is really collapsing .
and so you can see , literally , signs of their shock , signs of their outrage , signs of their anger , and signs of their grief .
these are the things that you can see .
there 's a lot you can 't see , also , underwater .
what 's going on underwater ?
well , some people say there are oil plumes .
some people say there are not oil plumes .
and congressman markey asks , you know , " is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes ? "
but i couldn 't take a submarine ride -- especially between the time i knew i was coming here and today -- so i had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the gulf of mexico .
so this is the gulf of mexico , sparkling place full of fish .
i created a little oil spill in the gulf of mexico . and i learned -- in fact , i confirmed -- the hypothesis that oil and water don 't mix until you add a dispersant ,
and then they start mixing .
and you add a little energy from the wind and the waves , and you get a big mess ,
a big mess that you can 't possibly clean , you can 't touch , you can 't extract and , i think most importantly -- this is what i think -- you can 't see it .
i think it 's being hidden on purpose .
now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess , that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream .
but as many people have said , there 's a large attempt to suppress what 's going on .
personally , i think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body , because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene .
but you can see it .
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface ,
and then it is attacked , because they don 't want the evidence , in my opinion .
okay .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
so do sea turtles .
when it breaks up , it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .
turtles eat it . it gets in the gills of fish . these guys have to swim around through it .
i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here .
a writer named ted williams called me , and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw , because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine .
he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago -- like about a week ago -- and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what 's going on .
that guide 's entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
he has no bookings left .
everybody wanted their deposit back . everybody is fleeing .
that 's the story of thousands of people .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat ,
and it was splattering oil out its blowhole .
and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolphins scare fish .
so he moved away from it , turned around a few minutes later , it was right next to the side of the boat again .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that .
and he felt that --
he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
now , in the exxon valdez spill , about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months .
their numbers have never recovered .
so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable .
it 's going to take longer for some things . and some things , i think , will probably come back a little faster .
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .
so the gulf is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean .
these tuna swim the entire ocean .
they get in the gulf stream . they go all the way to europe .
when it comes time to spawn , they come inside ,
and these two tuna that were tagged ,
you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick .
they 're probably having , at the very least , a catastrophic spawning season this year .
i 'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water .
they don 't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway .
but these are really high-performance athletic animals .
i don 't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
i don 't know if it 'll affect the adults .
if it 's not , it 's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae , i would certainly think .
but if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down ,
that 's what we 've done to this species through overfishing over many decades .
so while the oil spill , the leak , the eruption , is a catastrophe , i think it 's important to keep in mind that we 've done a lot to affect what 's in the ocean for a very , very long time .
it 's not like we 're starting with something that 's been okay .
we 're starting with something that 's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .
if you look around at the birds ,
there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year , but then leave .
and they populate much larger areas .
so for instance , most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds .
they were all on the gulf in may , while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places .
down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings .
they breed in the high arctic , and they winter down in southern south america .
but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the arctic .
i saw birds that breed in greenland in the gulf ,
so this is a hemispheric issue .
the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways . the biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
i think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of .
even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor , at least they shot back .
and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
there was nothing ready ,
and , you know , as we can see by what they 're doing . mainly what they 're doing is booms and dispersants .
the booms are absolutely not made for open water .
they don 't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated .
they get near shore . look at these two boats .
that one on the right is called fishing fool .
and i think , you know , that 's a great name for boats that think that they 're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface .
the dispersants make the oil go right under the booms .
the booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
so it 's just absolutely crazy .
here are shrimp boats employed .
there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets .
here they are working .
you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom .
all they 're doing is stirring it .
it 's just ridiculous .
also , for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms , there 's adjacent shoreline that doesn 't have any booms .
there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them .
and that lower photo , that 's a bird colony that has been boomed .
everybody 's trying to protect the bird colonies there .
well , as an ornithologist , i can tell you that birds fly , and that -- and that booming a bird colony doesn 't do it ; it doesn 't do it .
these birds make a living by diving into the water .
in fact , really what i think they should do , if anything -- they 're trying so hard to protect those nests -- actually , if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave , and that would be better for them this year .
as far as cleaning them , i don 't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds .
it 's really , really important that we express our compassion .
i think that 's the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
it 's really important to get those images and to show it .
but really , where are those birds going to get released to ?
it 's like taking somebody out of a burning building , treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building , because the oil is still gushing .
i refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
i think that this is the result of gross negligence .
not just b.p .
b.p. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could .
and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that 's supposed to be our government , protecting us .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know , if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for , and who has gotten above the laws .
now there are things that we can do in the future .
we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil , oil might start coming out of one of them .
and you 'd have some idea of what to do .
that 's certainly one of the things we need to do .
but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it 's our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
so i think that the oil blowout , the bank bailout , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people .
and even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years , there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from , buying the government out from under us .
now this has been a problem for a very , very long time .
you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of america ,
and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country .
okay , people who say they 're conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic , they would tell these corporations to go to hell .
that 's what it would really mean to be conservative .
so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it 's our government safeguarding our interests
and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
i think there are signs of hope .
we seem to be waking up a little bit .
the glass-steagall act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen , and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts -- that was put in effect in 1933 , was systematically destroyed .
back in place ,
but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
so it 's a continued fight .
it 's a historic moment right now .
we 're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have noted today .
there 's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this .
we 've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling .
the first offshore wells were called whales .
the first offshore drills were called harpoons .
we emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
now are we stuck with this ?
ever since we lived in caves , every time we wanted any energy , we lit something on fire , and that is still what we 're doing . we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
and people say we can 't have clean energy because it 's too expensive .
who says it 's too expensive ?
people who sell us fossil fuels .
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
energy is always a moral issue .
it 's an issue that is moral right now .
it 's a matter of right and wrong .
thank you very much .

and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
what do you guys think ?
are you more than your genes ?
yes ?
i think some people agree with me .
i think we should make a statement .
i think we should say it all together .
all right : " i 'm more than my genes " -- all together .
everybody : i am more than my genes .
sebastian seung : what am i ?
i am my connectome .
now , since you guys are really great , maybe you can humor me and say this all together too .
right . all together now .
everybody : i am my connectome .
ss : that sounded great .
you know , you guys are so great , you don 't even know what a connectome is , and you 're willing to play along with me .
i could just go home now .
well , so far only one connectome is known , that of this tiny worm .
its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons .
and in the 1970s and ' 80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
in this diagram , every node is a neuron , and every line is a connection .
this is the connectome of the worm c. elegans .
your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections .
there 's a diagram like this for your brain , but there 's no way it would fit on this slide .
your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters .
that 's a lot of information .
what 's in that information ?
we don 't know for sure , but there are theories .
since the 19th century , neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories -- the information that makes you , you -- maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain 's neurons .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they 're also encoded in the connections between your neurons .
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypothesis : i am my connectome .
i didn 't ask you to chant it because it 's true ; i just want you to remember it .
and in fact , we don 't know if this hypothesis is correct , because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it .
finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor .
and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own , we need more sophisticated technologies , that are automated , that will speed up the process of finding connectomes .
and in the next few minutes , i 'll tell you about some of these technologies , which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators .
now you 've probably seen pictures of neurons before .
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes .
they extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
but this is just a single neuron .
in order to find connectomes , we have to see all the neurons at the same time .
so let 's meet bobby kasthuri , who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university .
bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain .
and we 're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution , so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that 's because we have to work in three dimensions .
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
and still , you may not see the branches .
so we start at the top , and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red ,
and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice .
and we keep on doing that , slice after slice .
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
and we can do that for another neuron in green .
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations , and these are what are called synapses .
let 's zoom in on one synapse ,
and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron .
you should see small circles --
these are called vesicles .
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter .
and so when the green neuron wants to communicate , it wants to send a message to the red neuron , it spits out neurotransmitter .
at the synapse , the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone .
so you see how to find a synapse .
how can we find an entire connectome ?
well , we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse .
if we can do that throughout all the images , we could find a connectome .
now , at this point , you 've learned the basics of neurons and synapses .
and so i think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
according to this self-help book , guys brains are like waffles ; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes .
girls ' brains are like spaghetti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
you guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life .
but seriously , what 's wrong with this ?
you already know enough to tell me -- what 's wrong with this statement ?
it doesn 't matter whether you 're a guy or girl , everyone 's brains are like spaghetti .
or maybe really , really fine capellini with branches .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons , because there can be synapses at these points of contact .
by now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you .
i assure you , this is very tiny . it 's just six microns on a side .
so , here 's how it stacks up against an entire neuron .
and you can tell that , really , only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube .
and a neuron , well , that 's smaller than brain .
and that 's just a mouse brain --
it 's a lot smaller than a human brain .
so when show my friends this , sometimes they 've told me , " you know , sebastian , you should just give up .
neuroscience is hopeless . "
because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you don 't really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed .
in the 17th century , the mathematician and philosopher , blaise pascal , wrote of his dread of the infinite , his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space .
and , as a scientist , i 'm not supposed to talk about my feelings --
too much information , professor .
but may i ?
i feel curiosity , and i feel wonder , but at times i have also felt despair .
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
it 's absurd .
how could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this ?
and yet , i persist in this quixotic endeavor .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
someday , a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images .
and some day , artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome .
i do not know , but i hope that i will live to see that day ,
because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time .
it will take the work of generations to succeed .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we 're aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome .
for now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it 's actually worth taking seriously .
as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood , your personal identity changes slowly .
likewise , every connectome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
synapses can be created , and they can be eliminated .
and synapses can grow larger , and they can grow smaller .
second question : what causes these changes ?
well , it 's true .
to some extent , they are programmed by your genes .
but that 's not the whole story , because there are signals , electrical signals , that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .
these signals are called neural activity .
and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences .
and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
and if you put those two facts together , it means that your experiences can change your connectome .
and that 's why every connectome is unique , even those of genetically identical twins .
the connectome is where nature meets nurture .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
what 's in this picture ?
a cool and refreshing stream of water , you say .
what else is in this picture ?
do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed .
without it , the water would not know in which direction to flow .
and with the stream , i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity .
neural activity is constantly changing .
it 's like the water of the stream ; it never sits still .
the connections of the brain 's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows .
and so the connectome is like bed of the stream ;
but the metaphor is richer than that ,
because it 's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water , but over long timescales , the water also reshapes the bed of the stream .
and as i told you just now , neural activity can change the connectome .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
neural activity is its water , and the connectome is its bed .
so let 's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science .
suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work .
how will we go about testing the hypothesis " i am my connectome ? "
well , i propose a direct test .
let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
according to a theory that dates back to the 19th century , such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain .
because , if the first neurons in the chain are activated , through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons , which are activated , and so on down the line , like a chain of falling dominoes .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes .
but it won 't be easy , because they 're not going to look like this .
they 're going to be scrambled up .
so we 'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain .
and if we can do that , the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .
and if that were successful , that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome .
what a mess --
have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
i hope not .
but if you have , you know it 's very easy to make a mistake .
the branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain .
can anyone guess : what 's the total length of wires in your brain ?
i 'll give you a hint . it 's a big number .
i estimate , millions of miles ,
all packed in your skull .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain .
and indeed , the popular press loves headlines like , " anorexic brains are wired differently , " or " autistic brains are wired differently . "
these are plausible claims , but in truth , we can 't see the brain 's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true .
and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain , to see mental disorders in connectomes .
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication .
philosophers know this game very well .
if you believe that i am my connectome , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome .
i mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species .
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics .
if you pay 100,000 dollars , you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse , awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you .
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ?
or will they someday chuckle over our graves ?
i don 't know --
i prefer to test their beliefs , scientifically .
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain .
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains .
resurrection might succeed for the body , but not for the mind .
on the other hand , if the connectome is still intact , we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily .
i 've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small , and propels us to the world of the far future .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
as we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the african savanna , what distinguished us was our larger brains .
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
i believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists , but for all of us .
and i 'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today .
thank you .

zach kaplan and keith schacht demo toys from the future
zach kaplan : keith and i lead a research team .
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
of these six , the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding .
it comes from a company in japan called geltech . now go ahead and open it up .
keith schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft , but it 's also a strong magnet .
zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this .
we spent a long time thinking about why this is , and it 's just recently that we realized : it 's when we see something unexpected , it changes our understanding of the way things work .
as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time , if you assume that all magnets had to be hard , then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work .
zk : now , it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are .
but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible , we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world .
so , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors .
if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise , and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed .
imagine taking the same material , but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
for me , i really love this idea .
if you come to my apartment and see my closet , i 'm sure you 'd figure out why : it 's a mess .
ks : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference .
zk : it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l.a. , and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola .
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , the directors bureau . as we were talking , roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side .
and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand -- and you know , we shared the same ideas . and you could see it in his face :
roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder ; he opens it up and keith and i look in , and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on .
these things just get him really excited . and so we 're looking at these concepts , and we were just like , whoa , this guy 's good .
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
when we were going in the car back to the airport , we were thinking : why was this so powerful ?
and as we thought about it more , we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience , just as if you saw it on tv . so , for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future .
narrator : do you have a need for speed ?
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast , so tall , that when you hit the bottom , it uses brakes to stop .
aqua rocket : coming this summer .
ks : now , we showed the concept to a few people before this , and they asked us , when 's it coming out ?
so i just wanted to let you know , it 's not actually coming out , just the concept is .
zk : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
so i just want to quickly explain how this would work .
this is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board .
now this is important for two reasons .
one : the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that , if it were to hit the rider in the head , it wouldn 't injure him .
in addition , you can see from the diagram on the right , the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .
so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down .
the force of the water rushing down , in addition to that repulsion force , would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market .
it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .
when you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube .
and i 'm going to kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint .
ks : so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal , it 's not a magnetic material . but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you . now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
now , i 'm not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling , the greater the stopping force .
zk : now , our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole ,
and i have it right here in my pocket .
there 're a few different versions of it .
ks : some of them automatically unroll like this one .
they can be made to automatically roll up , or they can be made stable , like zach 's , to hold any position in between .
zk : as we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these , or how they 're being applied currently -- he was telling us that , in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then , when they 're out on the field , erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base .
in our brainstorms , we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal : so at the end of the game , you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag .
ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don 't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this .
man : i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house -- i do it that way .
woman : i 'd make my very own walking stick .
woman : i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree .
woman : an olive server .
man : some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
woman : i would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... yeah .
zk : now , for our next technology we 're going to do a little demonstration , and so we need a volunteer from the audience .
you sir , come on up .
come on up . tell everybody your name .
steve jurvetson : steve .
zk : it 's steve . all right steve , now , follow me .
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign .
right there . that 's great .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
ks : no , not yet .
zk : i 'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
ks : little bit -- that 's perfect , just perfect .
now , zach , we 're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future .
so here , come on up to the front . all right , so now if you 'll see here -- no , no , it 's ok .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
sj : it 's cold .
ks : now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it 's a dry liquid developed by 3m .
it 's perfectly clear , it 's odorless , it 's colorless .
it 's so safe you could drink this stuff .
and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water .
all right , well thanks for coming up .
zk : wait , wait , steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
sj : excellent , thank you .
ks : thanks for coming up . let 's give him a big round of applause .
so what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer .
now , the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics , that we 'd get him wet , that we 'd hurt the books or the computers . it works because it 's non-conductive .
so you can see here , you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage .
you can circulate it to draw the heat away .
but today it 's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid .
again , it 's perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn 't hurt anything .
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game . so during halftime , it could rain down on the players , cool everyone down , and in a matter of minutes it would dry . wouldn 't hurt the court .
zk : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical . one of their r & d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
we have a video to show you .
ks : so you see there , it didn 't bounce back . now , this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing .
it 's technically called , " shape-retaining property . " now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .
zk : for example , you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist , but doesn 't use a buckle .
taking it a little further , if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet , and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table , so that way on a windy day it wouldn 't blow away .
for our next technology , it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself , because it 's an ink .
so , we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper .
ks : as this paper is bending , the resistance of the ink changes .
so with simple electronics , you can detect how much the page is being bent .
now , to think about the potential for this , think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards , on the back of cereal boxes , board games . any place you use ink , you could change the way you interact with it .
zk : so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .
this could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
you see the dark line on the side and the top . as you turn the pages of the book , the book can actually detect what page you 're on , based on the curvature of the pages .
in addition , if you were to fold in one of the corners , then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes .
ks : for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
old milk carton : oh yeah , it smells good .
who are you ?
new milk carton : i 'm new milk .
omc : i used to smell like you .
narrator : fresh watch , from inventables dairy farms .
packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off .
don 't let milk spoil your morning .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
ks : now the way it works : there 's a matrix of color dyes .
and these dyes change color in response to odors .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
but like in the milk commercial , if you know what odor you want to detect , then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor .
zk : right . it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself , and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible ,
beyond just detecting spoiled food . it 's really where the significance of it lies .
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn , how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene ?
and he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ;
if there were no dead policemen , it was ok to go .
i mean , this is a true story . they 're using policemen as canaries .
but more seriously , they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans , and say if it 's safe for the firemen .
in addition , he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing , where they 're working on medical equipment . so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .
this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
currently , they 're using a method of trial and error , but this could tell you precisely what disease you have .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . prior to seeing this , we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole couldn 't fit in your pocket ;
something as inexpensive as ink couldn 't sense the way paper is being bent ;
every one of these things -- and we 're constantly trying to find more .
zk : this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing .
i 'm sure it 's obvious to you now , but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why . i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson , over downstairs by the escalators , and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box , one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that doesn 't get wet . he said that he was playing with it with his son .
and you know , his son was mesmerized , because he would dunk it in the water , he would take it out and it was bone dry . a few weeks later , he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother 's hair , and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , " look , hydrophobic string . "
i mean , after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me .
thank you very much .
ks : thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / dan _ barber _ s _ surprising _ foie _ gras _ parable.html
at the taste3 conference , chef dan barber tells the story of a small farm in spain that has found a humane way to produce foie gras . raising his geese in a natural environment , farmer eduardo sousa embodies the kind of food production barber believes in .

dan barber 's foie gras parable
i went to spain a few months ago and i had the best foie gras of my life .
the best culinary experience of my life .
because what i saw , i 'm convinced , is the future of cooking .
ridiculous , right ?
foie gras and the future of cooking .
there 's not a food today that 's more maligned than foie gras , right ?
i mean , it 's crucified .
it was outlawed in chicago for a while .
it 's pending here in california , and just recently in new york .
it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu , you risk being attacked .
really , it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef .
i 'm not saying that there 's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras .
the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage , which is the force feeding .
basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat .
more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime .
its liver expands by eight times .
suffice to say it 's like -- it 's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .
the problem for us chefs is that it 's so freakin ' delicious .
i mean , i love the stuff .
it is fatty , it 's sweet , it 's silky , it 's unctuous .
it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible .
can we produce a menu that 's delicious without foie gras ?
yes , sure .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
not a lot of people are doing it .
and for good reason .
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras .
natural foie gras .
what 's natural about foie gras ?
to take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall , geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter .
and the rest of the year they 're free to roam around eduardo 's land and eat what they want .
so no gavage , no force feeding , no factory-like conditions , no cruelty .
and it 's shockingly not a new idea .
his great-granddad started -- pateria de sousa -- in 1812 .
and they 've been doing it quietly ever since .
that is until last year , when eduardo won the coup de coeur , the coveted french gastronomic prize .
it 's like the olympics of food products .
he placed first for his foie gras .
big , big problem .
as he said to me , that really pissed the french off .
he said it sort of gleefully .
it was all over the papers .
i read about it . it was in le monde .
" spanish chef accused ... " -- and the french accused him .
" spanish chef accused of cheating . "
they accused him of paying off the judges .
they implicated actually , the spanish government , amazingly .
huh , amazing .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
couldn 't find a shred of evidence .
now , look at the guy .
he doesn 't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his foie gras .
so that died down , and very soon afterward , new controversy .
he shouldn 't win because it 's not foie gras .
it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage .
there 's no force feeding .
so by definition , he 's lying and should be disqualified .
as funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , i would have said , " that 's kind of true . "
you know , foie gras by definition , force feeding , it 's gavage , and that 's what you get when you want foie gras .
that is , until i went to eduardo 's farm in extremadura , 50 miles north of seville , right on the portugal border .
i saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time , like everything beautiful in nature , is utterly simple .
and he said to me , really from the first moment , my life 's work is to give the geese what they want .
he repeated that about 50 times in the two days i was with him .
i 'm just here to give the geese what they want .
actually , when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone
taking pictures of them
like his children in the grass .
amazing .
he 's really just in love with -- he 's at one with -- he 's the goose whisperer .
and when i was speaking to him , you know , i thought , like i 'm speaking to you now , right , but sort of in the middle of my questions , my excited questions , because the more i got to know him and his system , the more exciting this whole idea became .
he kept going like this to me .
and i thought , ok , excited jew from new york , right ?
i 'm talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , i slowed down .
and finally , by the end of the day i was like , ed-uar-do , you know like this ?
but he was still going like this .
i figured it out .
i was speaking too loudly .
so i hushed my voice .
i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper .
and he stopped doing this .
and amazingly , the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around -- " get the hell away from this kid ! " --
when i lowered my voice , they all came right up to us .
right up to us , like right up to here .
right along the fence line .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
the fence -- like this conception of fence that we have it 's totally backward with him .
the electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside .
he rewired it . he invented it .
i 've never seen it . have you ?
you fence in animals . you electrify the inside .
he doesn 't .
he electrifies only the outside .
why ?
because he said to me that he felt like the geese -- and he proved this actually , not just a conceit , he proved this -- the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks .
even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else .
he felt like they felt manipulated .
so he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .
now , what happened ?
they ate , and he showed me on a chart , how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers .
the landscape is incredible .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
it really is the garden of eden .
there 's figs and everything else there for the taking .
and the irony of ironies is because extremadura , the area -- what does extremadura mean ?
extra hard land , right ?
extra difficult . extra hard .
but over four generations , he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu . upgrades the life for these geese .
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .
another irony , the double irony is that on the figs and the olives , eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras .
he doesn 't care .
he lets them take what they want and he says , " usually , it 's about 50 percent . they 're very fair . "
the other 50 percent , he takes and he sells and he makes money on them .
part of the income for his farm .
a big part of his income for his farm .
but he never controls it .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
his biggest obstacle , really , was the marketplace , which demands these days bright yellow foie gras .
that 's how i 've been trained .
you want to look and see what good foie gras is , it 's got to be bright yellow .
it 's the indication that it 's the best foie gras .
well , because he doesn 't force feed , because he doesn 't gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
or they were .
but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush .
the lupin bush , it 's all around extremadura .
he let it go to seed , he took the seeds , he planted it on his 30 acres , all around .
and the geese love the lupin bush .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
and when they eat the seeds , their foie gras turns yellow .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen .
so i 'm listening to all this , you know , and i 'm like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
is he like , you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything , and it was always nature .
it was never him .
and i was like , you know , i always get a little , like , weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves .
because , really , they want you to look at themselves , right ?
but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape .
so it 's like , here i am , i 'm on the fence about this guy , but increasingly , eating up his every word .
and we 're sitting there , and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance , so i look over .
and he grabs my arm and the translator 's , and ducks us under a bush and says , " watch this . "
" shush , " he says again for the 500th time to me .
" shush , watch this . "
and this squadron of geese come over .
[ clapping ] and they 're getting louder , louder , louder , like really loud , right over us .
and like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they 're called back -- and they 're called back and back and back .
and then they circle around .
and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese .
[ clapping ] and the wild geese are calling down .
[ clapping ] and it 's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land .
and i 'm just saying , " no way . "
no way .
and i look at eduardo , who 's near tears looking at this , and i say , " you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ? "
and he says , " no , no , no .
they 've come to stay . "
they 've come to stay ?
it 's like the dna of a goose is to fly south in the winter , right ?
i said that . i said " isn 't that what they 're put on this earth for ?
to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ? "
he said , " no , no , no .
their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life .
to happiness .
they find it here .
they don 't need anything more . "
they stop . they mate with his domesticated geese , and his flock continues .
think about that for a minute .
it 's brilliant , right ?
imagine -- i don 't know , imagine a hog farm in , like , north carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay .
so how did it taste ?
i finally got to taste it before i left .
he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras , confit de foie gras .
it was incredible .
and the problem with saying that , of course , is that you know , at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .
and i 'd like to make a metaphor , but i don 't have one really .
i was drinking this guy 's kool-aid so much , he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like , this guy 's a genius , you know ?
i 'm really in love with him at this point .
but it truly was the best foie gras of my life .
so much so that i don 't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment .
i 'd had something that was called foie gras .
but this was transformative . really transformative .
and i say to you , i might not stick to this , but i don 't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo .
it was sweet , it was unctuous .
it had all the qualities of foie gras , but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty .
and you could taste herbs , you could taste spices .
and i kept -- i said , you know , i swear to god i tasted star anise .
i was sure of it .
and i 'm not like some super taster , you know ?
but i can taste things .
there 's 100 percent star anise in there .
and he says , " no . "
and i ended up like going down the spices , and finally , it was like , ok , salt and pepper , thinking he 's salted and peppered his liver .
but no .
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras , he sticks them in this jar
and he confits it .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what ?
we went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
he doesn 't need salt and pepper .
and he doesn 't need spices , because he 's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors
that his geese love to gorge on .
i turned to him at the end of the meal , and it 's a question i asked several times , and he hadn 't , kind of , answered me directly , but i said , " now look , you 're in spain , some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- ferran adria , the preeminent chef of the world today , not that far from you .
how come you don 't give him this ?
how come no one 's really heard of you ? "
and it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my excitement , he answered me directly and he said , " because chefs don 't deserve my foie gras . "
and he was right .
he was right .
chefs take foie gras and they make it their own .
they create a dish where all the vectors point at us .
with eduardo it 's about the expression of nature .
and as he said , i think fittingly , it 's a gift from god , with god saying , you 've done good work .
simple .
i flew home , i 'm on the flight with my little black book and i took , you know , pages and pages of notes about it .
i really was moved .
and in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ?
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
he said , " i think it 's an insult to history . "
and i wrote , insult to history .
i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing my hair out .
it 's like , why didn 't i follow up on that ?
what the hell does that mean ?
insult to history .
so i did some research when i got back , and here 's what i found .
the history of foie gras .
jews invented foie gras .
true story .
true story .
by accident .
they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz .
gotten sick of the chicken fat .
they were looking for an alternative .
and they saw in the fall that there was this natural , beautiful , sweet , delicious fat from geese .
and they slaughtered them , used the fat throughout the winter for cooking .
the pharaoh got wind of this -- this is true , right off the internet .
the pharaoh got -- i swear to god .
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he tasted it and fell in love with it .
he started demanding it .
and he didn 't want it just in the fall , he wanted it all year round .
and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone .
and the jews , fearing for their life , had to come up with an ingenious idea , or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh 's wishes , of course .
and they invented , what ? gavage .
they invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives , and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver , and the good stuff they kept for themselves .
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
that 's the history of foie gras .
and if you think about it , it 's the history of industrial agriculture .
it 's the history of what we eat today .
most of what we eat today .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
all of it , our food system .
that 's also an insult to history .
it 's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
whether we 're talking about beef cattle or we 're talking about chickens , or we 're talking about broccoli or brussels sprouts , or in the case of this morning 's new york times , catfish -- which wholesale are going out of business .
whatever it is , it 's a mindset that is reminiscent of general motors .
it 's rooted in extraction .
take more , sell more , waste more .
and for the future it won 't serve us .
jonas salk has a great quote .
he said , " if all the insects disappeared , life on earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years .
if human beings disappeared , life on earth as we know it would flourish . "
and he 's right .
we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
really new .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food .
we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
listening as janine benyus , one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says , " listening to nature 's operating instructions . "
that 's what eduardo does , and does so brilliantly .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , i think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
whether we 're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras .
and it 's also almost always , and i haven 't found an example otherwise , but almost always , the most delicious choice .
that 's serendipitous .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / amit _ sood _ building _ a _ museum _ of _ museums _ on _ the _ web.html
imagine being able to see artwork in the greatest museums around the world without leaving your chair . driven by his passion for art , amit sood tells the story of how he developed art project to let people do just that .

amit sood : building a museum of museums on the web
my name is amit .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who 's actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i 'm going to focus on the demo .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it 's access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education -- i 'm not complaining -- but i didn 't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
and so when i started traveling and going to these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i 'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we 've had since launch .
so , simple : you come to googleartproject.com .
you look around at all these museums here .
you 've got the uffizi , you 've got the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
i 'm going to actually get to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
click and , bang , you 're in this museum .
it doesn 't matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn 't really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you 're in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . i haven 't come to the best part .
so now i 'm in front of one of my favorite paintings , " the harvesters " by pieter bruegel at the met .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i 'm going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
and i get a lot of people asking me : " what do you get for 10 billion pixels ? " so i 'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , " hold on . that sounds interesting . " went in , and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday .
and apparently it was quite popular .
i don 't know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
now just to give you some perspective , i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let 's just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
so another one of my favorites , " the starry night . "
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
i 'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i 'm really going to get to the cracks .
this is " the starry night , " i think , never seen like this before .
i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature .
there 's a lot of other stuff here , but i don 't have time .
this is the real cool part . it 's called collections .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn 't matter if you 're rich , if you 're poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn 't matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and i 've created this , called the power of zoom -- you can just zoom around .
this is " the ambassadors , " based in the national gallery .
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you 're feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn 't , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
i probably shouldn 't say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that 's been my humbling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is , " did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? " and the answer is no .
it 's to supplement the experience .
and that 's it . thank you .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / philippe _ starck _ thinks _ deep _ on _ design.html
designer philippe starck -- with no pretty slides to show -- spends 18 minutes reaching for the very roots of the question " why design ? " listen carefully for one perfect mantra for all of us , genius or not .

philippe starck thinks deep on design
you will understand nothing with my type of english .
it 's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people .
i must tell you i am like that , not very comfortable , because usually , in life , i think my job is absolutely useless .
i mean , i feel useless .
now after carolyn , and all the other guys , i feel like shit .
and definitively , i don 't know why i am here , but -- you know the nightmare you can have , like you are an impostor , you arrive at the opera , and they push you , " you must sing ! "
i don 't know .
so , so , because i have nothing to show , nothing to say , we shall try to speak about something else .
we can start , if you want , by understanding -- it 's just to start , it 's not interesting , but -- how i work .
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known , i mean , yes , lemon squeezer , toilet brush , toothpick , beautiful toilet seats , and why not -- a toothbrush ?
i don 't try to design the toothbrush .
i don 't try to say , " oh , that will be a beautiful object , " or something like that .
that doesn 't interest me .
because there is different types of design .
the one , we can call it the cynical design , that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the ' 50s , who said , what is ugly is a bad sale , la laideur se vend mal , which is terrible .
it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing , for producer to make product more sexy , like that , they sell more : it 's shit , it 's obsolete , it 's ridiculous .
i call that the cynical design .
after , there is the narcissistic design : it 's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers .
after , there is people like me , who try to deserve to exist , and who are so ashamed to make this useless job , who try to do it in another way , and they try , i try , to not make the object for the object but for the result , for the profit for the human being , the person who will use it .
if we take the toothbrush -- i don 't think about the toothbrush . i think , " what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth ? "
and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth , i must imagine : who owns this mouth ?
what is the life of the owner of this mouth ? in what society [ does ] this guy live ?
what civilization creates this society ?
what animal species creates this civilization ?
when i arrive -- and i take one minute , i am not so intelligent -- when i arrive at the level of animal species , that becomes real interesting .
me , i have strictly no power to change anything .
but when i come back , i can understand why i shall not do it , because today to not do it , it 's more positive than do it , or how i shall do it .
but to come back , where i am at the animal species , there is things to see .
there is things to see , there is the big challenge .
the big challenge in front of us .
because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call " the big image . " the big image is our story , our poetry , our romanticism .
our poetry is our mutation , our life .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appears four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
voice offstage : four point five .
yes , point five , ok , ok , ok ! i 'm a designer , that 's all , of christmas gifts .
and before , there was this soup , called " soupe primordiale , " this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud , no life , nothing .
so then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive -- pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies .
some million years after -- pshoo-shoo , bloop-bloop -- ah , wake up !
at the end , finally , that succeeds , and life appears .
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
even , i think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what i mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-monkey , and the fun is , the super-monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
can you imagine ? from that stupid bacteria to us , with a microphone , with a computer , with an ipod : four billion years .
and we know , and especially carolyn knows , that when the sun will implode , the earth will burn , explode , i don 't know what , and this is scheduled for four , four billion years ?
yes , she said , something like that . ok , that means we are at half of the story .
fantastic ! it 's a beauty !
can you imagine ? it 's very symbolic .
because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today .
and today , we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years .
and this territory is fantastic .
that is our poetry . that is our beautiful story .
it 's our romanticism . mu-ta-tion . we are mutants .
and if we don 't deeply understand , if we don 't integrate that we are mutants , we completely miss the story .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
we have a way to look at earth like that , you know , " i am the man . the final man .
you know , we mutate during four billion years before , but now , because it 's me , we stop . fin .
for the end , for the eternity , it is one with a red jacket . "
something like that . i am not sure of that .
because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that .
there is so many things to do ; it 's so fresh .
and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius , but everybody is obliged to participate .
and to participate , for a mutant , there is a minimum of exercise , a minimum of sport .
we can say that .
the first , if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do , is the duty of vision .
i can explain you . i shall try .
if you walk like that , it 's ok , it 's ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
and you will fall , and you will die . dangerous .
that 's why , perhaps , you will try to have this angle of vision .
ok , i can see , if i found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
i raise the angle of vision , but it 's still very -- selfish , selfish , egoiste -- yes , selfish .
you , you survive . it 's ok .
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , " i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you ,
i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , " something like that .
i live in society ; i live in community .
it 's ok . you start to be in the territory of intelligence , we can say .
from this level , the more you can raise this angle of view , the more you will be important for the society .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
the more you will rise , to see far and high , like that , the more you will be important for the story of our mutation .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
from this to here , that , it 's genius .
ptolemy , eratosthenes , einstein , things like that .
nobody 's obliged to be a genius .
it 's better , but nobody .
take care , in this training , to be a good mutant . there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , " ah ! my god , there is god . ah ! god ! "
god is a trap . god is the answer when we don 't know the answer .
that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don 't understand , you go , " ah , it 's god , it 's god . " that 's ridiculous .
that 's why -- jump , like that ? no , don 't jump .
come back . because , after , there is another trap .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself .
it 's called schizophrenia , and you are dead also .
that 's why every morning , now , because you are a good mutant , you will raise your angle of view .
out , more of the horizontal . you are an intelligence .
never forget -- like that , like that .
it 's very , very , very important .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
it 's because we -- if we look from far , we see our line of evolution .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .
from far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
it 's made of light and shadow .
we can say light is civilization , shadow is barbaria .
and it 's very important to know where we are .
because some cycle , there is a spot in the cycle , and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle .
that means , we can imagine -- i don 't say it was fantastic , but in the ' 80s , there was not too much war , like that , it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized .
in this case , people like me are acceptable .
we can say , " it 's luxurious time . "
we have time to think , we have time to i don 't know what , speak about art and things like that .
it 's ok . we are in the light .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to shadow , we fall so fast to barbaria .
with many , many , many , many face of barbaria .
because it 's not , the barbaria we have today , it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think .
there is different type of barbaria .
that 's why we must adapt .
that means , when barbaria is back , forget the beautiful chairs , forget the beautiful hotel , forget design , even -- i 'm sorry to say -- forget art .
forget all that . there is priority ; there is urgency .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radicalization ,
i 'm sorry if that 's not very english .
you must go back to fight , to battle .
that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job .
that 's why i am here , to try to do it the best possible .
but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that 's why i 'm the best -- it 's nothing .
because it 's not the right time .
that 's why i say that . i say that , because , i repeat , nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason , the reason of our beautiful dream , of this civilization .
and because we must all work to finish this story .
because the scenario of this civilization -- about love , progress , and things like that -- it 's ok , but there is so many different , other scenarios of other civilizations .
this scenario , of this civilization , was about becoming powerful , intelligent , like this idea we have invented , this concept of god .
we are god now . we are . it 's almost done .
we have just to finish the story .
that is very , very important .
and when you don 't understand really what 's happened , you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
and you can fall , and it 's very dangerous .
no , you must really understand that .
because we have almost finished , i 'll repeat this story .
and the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization ,
and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story , a new poetry , a new romanticism .
with billions of people who have been born , worked , lived and died before us , these people who have worked so much , we have now bring beautiful things , beautiful gifts , we know so many things .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed . now you have a duty : invent a new story . invent a new poetry .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
we give you white pages . invent .
we give you the best tools , the best tools , and now , do it .
that 's why i continue to work , even if it 's for toilet brush .

the days are past when a person , company or brand could tightly control their reputation -- online chatter and spin mean that if you 're relevant , there 's a constant , free-form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim leberecht offers three big ideas about accepting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an impetus to recommit to your values .

tim leberecht : 3 ways to lose control of your brand
companies are losing control .
what happens on wall street no longer stays on wall street .
what happens in vegas ends up on youtube .
reputations are volatile . loyalties are fickle .
management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff .
a recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm .
however , in the same survey , only four percent of employees agreed .
companies are losing control of their customers and their employees .
but are they really ?
i 'm a marketer , and as a marketer , i know that i 've never really been in control .
your brand is what other people say about you when you 're not in the room , the saying goes .
hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
they can listen and join the conversation .
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
they can design for it . but how ?
first of all , they can give employees and customers more control .
they can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas , knowledge , content , designs and product .
they can give them more control over pricing , which is what the band radiohead did with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album " in rainbows . " buyers could determine the price , but the offer was exclusive , and only stood for a limited period of time .
the album sold more copies than previous releases of the band .
the danish chocolate company anthon berg opened a so-called " generous store " in copenhagen .
it asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
it turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
companies can even give control to hackers .
when microsoft kinect came out , the motion-controlled add-on to its xbox gaming console , it immediately drew the attention of hackers .
microsoft first fought off the hacks , but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits .
the sense of co-ownership , the free publicity , the added value , all helped drive sales .
the ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
outdoor clothier patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out ebay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones .
in an even more radical stance against consumerism , the company placed a " don 't buy this jacket " advertisement during the peak of shopping season .
it may have jeopardized short-term sales , but it builds lasting , long-term loyalty based on shared values .
research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive .
the brazilian company semco group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries .
hulu and netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier .
take the travel service nextpedition .
nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
it does not tell the traveler where she 's going until the very last minute , and information is provided just in time . similarly , dutch airline klm launched a surprise campaign , seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination .
u.k.-based interflora monitored twitter for users who were having a bad day , and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers .
is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? yes .
force them to help others .
a recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity .
at frog , the company i work for , we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees , helping them get to know each other fast .
by applying a strict process , we give them less control , less choice , but we enable more and richer social interactions .
companies are the makers of their fortunes , and like all of us , they are utterly exposed to serendipity .
that should make them more humble , more vulnerable and more human .
at the end of the day , as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies ' behavior in broad daylight , staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition .
or as the ballet dancer alonzo king said , " what 's interesting about you is you . "
for the true selves of companies to come through , openness is paramount , but radical openness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
" a smile is a door that is half open and half closed , " the author jennifer egan wrote .
companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . they can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
or they can simply smile , and remain open to all possibilities .
thank you .

wael ghonim is the google executive who helped jumpstart egypt 's democratic revolution ... with a facebook page memorializing a victim of the regime 's violence . speaking at tedxcairo , he tells the inside story of the past two months , when everyday egyptians showed that " the power of the people is stronger than the people in power . "

wael ghonim : inside the egyptian revolution
this is revolution 2.0 .
no one was a hero . no one was a hero .
because everyone was a hero .
everyone has done something .
we all use wikipedia .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content ,
and at the end of the day you 've built the largest encyclopedia in the world .
from just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world .
and in the egyptian revolution , the revolution 2.0 , everyone has contributed something , small or big . they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .
it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill .
everything was going bad .
everything was going wrong .
we only ranked high when it comes to poverty , corruption , lack of freedom of speech , lack of political activism .
those were the achievements of our great regime .
yet , nothing was happening .
and it 's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated .
in fact , people were extremely frustrated .
but the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear .
everyone was scared .
not everyone . there were actually a few brave egyptians that i have to thank for being so brave -- going into protests as a couple of hundred , getting beaten up and arrested .
but in fact , the majority were scared .
everyone did not want really to get in trouble .
a dictator cannot live without the force .
they want to make people live in fear .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , blackberry , sms .
it 's helping all of us to connect .
platforms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , " wow , i 'm not alone .
there are a lot of people who are frustrated . " there are lots of people who are frustrated .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
there are lots of people who care about their freedom .
they probably have the best life in the world .
they are living in happiness . they are living in their villas .
they are happy . they don 't have problems .
but they are still feeling the pain of the egyptian .
a lot of us , we 're not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man who 's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country .
the internet has played a great role , helping these people to speak up their minds , to collaborate together , to start thinking together .
it was an educational campaign .
khaled saeed was killed in june 2010 .
i still remember the photo .
i still remember every single detail of that photo .
the photo was horrible .
he was tortured , brutally tortured to death .
but then what was the answer of the regime ?
" he choked on a pile of hash " --
that was their answer : " he 's a criminal .
he 's someone who escaped from all these bad things . " but people did not relate to this .
people did not believe this .
because of the internet , the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth .
and everyone started to think that " this guy could be my brother . " he was a middle-class guy .
his photo was remembered by all of us .
a page was created .
an anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page , and there was no plan .
" what are we going to do ? " " i don 't know . " in a few days , tens of thousands of people there -- angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs , " enough .
get those who killed this guy . to just bring them to justice . " but of course , they don 't listen .
it was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership .
everyone was an owner in this page .
people started contributing ideas .
in fact , one of the most ridiculous ideas was , " hey , let 's have a silent stand .
let 's get people to go in the street , face the sea , their back to the street , dressed in black , standing up silently for one hour , doing nothing and then just leaving , going back home . "
for some people , that was like , " wow , silent stand .
and next time it 's going to be vibration . " people were making fun of the idea .
but actually when people went to the street -- the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria -- it felt like -- it was amazing . it was great
because it connected people from the virtual world , bringing them to the real world , sharing the same dream , the same frustration , the same anger , the same desire for freedom .
and they were doing this thing .
but did the regime learn anything ? not really .
they were actually attacking them .
they were actually abusing them , despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were -- they were not even protesting .
and things had developed until the tunisian revolution .
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
in fact , the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing .
people were taking shots and photos ; people were reporting violations of human rights in egypt ; people were suggesting ideas , they were actually voting on ideas , and then they were executing the ideas ; people were creating videos .
everything was done by the people to the people , and that 's the power of the internet .
there was no leader .
the leader was everyone on that page .
the tunisian experiment , as amir was saying , inspired all of us , showed us that there is a way .
yes we can . we can do it .
we have the same problems ; we can just go in the streets .
and when i saw the street on the 25th , i went back and said , " egypt before the 25th is never going to be egypt after the 25th .
the revolution is happening .
this is not the end , this is the beginning of the end . " i was detained on the 27th night .
thank god i announced the locations and everything .
but they detained me .
and i 'm not going to talk about my experience , because this is not about me .
i was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
and i did not really hear anything . i did not know anything .
i was not allowed to speak with anyone .
and i went out .
the next day i was in tahrir .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i never had in my mind to see this egyptian , the amazing egyptian .
the fear is no longer fear .
it 's actually strength -- it 's power .
people were so empowered .
it was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights .
completely opposite .
extremism became tolerance .
who would [ have ] imagined before the 25th , if i tell you that hundreds of thousands of christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of muslims are going to protect them , and then hundreds of thousands of muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of christians are going to protect them -- this is amazing .
all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda , or mainstream media , are proven wrong .
this whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the egyptian man , the egyptian woman , how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream .
when i saw that , i went back and i wrote on facebook .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what 's going on , regardless of the details .
i said that , " we are going to win .
we are going to win because we don 't understand politics .
we 're going to win because we don 't play their dirty games .
we 're going to win because we don 't have an agenda .
we 're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts .
we 're going to win because we have dreams .
we 're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams . " and that 's actually what happened . we won .
and that 's not because of anything , but because we believed in our dream .
the winning here is not the whole details of what 's going to happen in the political scene .
the winning is the winning of the dignity of every single egyptian .
actually , i had this taxi driver telling me , " listen , i am breathing freedom .
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . " for me that 's winning , regardless of all the details .
my last word to you is a statement i believe in , which egyptians have proven to be true ,
that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power .
thanks a lot .

at tedxrainier , patricia kuhl shares astonishing findings about how babies learn one language over another -- by listening to the humans around them and " taking statistics " on the sounds they need to know . clever lab experiments show how 6-month-old babies use sophisticated reasoning to understand their world .

patricia kuhl : the linguistic genius of babies
i want you to take a look at this baby .
what you 're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch .
but today i 'm going to talk to you about something you can 't see -- what 's going on up in that little brain of hers .
the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what 's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
and what we 're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the " celestial openness " of the child 's mind .
what we see here is a mother in india ,
and she 's speaking koro , which is a newly discovered language .
and she 's talking to her baby .
what this mother -- and the 800 people who speak koro in the world -- understands [ is ] that , to preserve this language , they need to speak it to the babies .
and therein lies a critical puzzle .
why is it that you can 't preserve a language by speaking to you and i , to the adults ?
well , it 's got to do with your brain .
what we see here is that language has a critical period for learning .
the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
and you 'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language .
babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven , and then there 's a systematic decline .
after puberty , we fall off the map .
no scientists dispute this curve , but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way .
work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development -- and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language .
we think , by studying how the sounds are learned , we 'll have a model for the rest of language , and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social , emotional and cognitive development .
so we 've been studying the babies using a technique that we 're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
the baby sits on a parent 's lap , and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from " ah " to " ee . " if they do so at the appropriate time , the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum .
a six-monther adores the task .
what have we learned ?
well , babies all over the world are what i like to describe as " citizens of the world . " they can discriminate all the sounds of all languages , no matter what country we 're testing and what language we 're using ,
and that 's remarkable because you and i can 't do that .
we 're culture-bound listeners .
we can discriminate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages .
so the question arises : when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are ?
and the answer : before their first birthdays .
what you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in tokyo and the united states , here in seattle , as they listened to " ra " and " la " -- sounds important to english , but not to japanese .
so at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent .
two months later something incredible occurs .
the babies in the united states are getting a lot better , babies in japan are getting a lot worse , but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn .
so the question is : what 's happening during this critical two-month period ?
this is the critical period for sound development , but what 's going on up there ?
so there are two things going on .
the first is that the babies are listening intently to us , and they 're taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they 're taking statistics .
so listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in english and then in japanese . english mother : ah , i love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice .
japanese mother : [ japanese ] patricia kuhl : during the production of speech , when babies listen , what they 're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear .
and those distributions grow .
and what we 've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics , and the statistics of japanese and english are very , very different . english has a lot of rs and ls . the distribution shows .
and the distribution of japanese is totally different , where we see a group of intermediate sounds , which is known as the japanese " r. "
so babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are .
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
we 're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development .
so what we 're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
we 're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize .
it 's raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them , one after the other , depending on who they 're speaking to .
so we asked ourselves , can the babies take statistics on a brand new language ?
and we tested this by exposing american babies who 'd never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period .
we knew that , when monolinguals were tested in taipei and seattle on the mandarin sounds , they showed the same pattern .
six to eight months , they 're totally equivalent .
two months later , something incredible happens .
but the taiwanese babies are getting better , not the american babies .
what we did was expose american babies during this period to mandarin .
it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions .
here 's what it looked like in the laboratory .
mandarin speaker : [ mandarin ] pk : so what have we done to their little brains ?
we had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn 't improve your mandarin skills .
so a group of babies came in and listened to english .
and we can see from the graph that exposure to english didn 't improve their mandarin .
but look at what happened to the babies exposed to mandarin for 12 sessions .
they were as good as the babies in taiwan who 'd been listening for 10-and-a-half months .
what it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language .
whatever you put in front of them , they 'll take statistics on .
but we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise .
so we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage , the same 12 sessions , but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen . what did we do to their brains ?
what you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever .
it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .
the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
we want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions , as opposed to in front of human beings .
thankfully , we have a new machine , magnetoencephalography , that allows us to do this .
it looks like a hair dryer from mars . but it 's completely safe , completely non-invasive and silent .
we 're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 squids -- these are superconducting quantum interference devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking .
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an meg machine while they are learning .
so this is little emma .
she 's a six-monther .
and she 's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears .
you can see , she can move around .
we 're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap ,
so she 's free to move completely unconstrained .
it 's a technical tour de force .
what are we seeing ?
we 're seeing the baby brain .
as the baby hears a word in her language
the auditory areas light up , and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence , getting the brain coordinated with its different areas , and causality , one brain area causing another to activate .
we are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child 's brain development .
we 're going to be able to see a child 's brain as they experience an emotion , as they learn to speak and read , as they solve a math problem , as they have an idea .
and we 're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning .
just as the poets and writers described , we 're going to be able to see , i think , that wondrous openness , utter and complete openness , of the mind of a child .
in investigating the child 's brain , we 're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
thank you .

joan halifax : compassion and the true meaning of empathy
i want to address the issue of compassion .
compassion has many faces .
some of them are fierce ; some of them are wrathful ; some of them are tender ; some of them are wise .
a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , " love and compassion are necessities .
they are not luxuries .
without them , humanity cannot survive . " and i would suggest , it is not only humanity that won 't survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we 've heard today .
it is the big cats , and it 's the plankton .
two weeks ago , i was in bangalore in india .
i was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of bangalore .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragile , obviously in the latter phase of active dying .
i looked into her face .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
and i remembered a line from the mahabharata , the great indian epic : " what is the most wondrous thing in the world , yudhisthira ? " and yudhisthira replied , " the most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don 't realize it can happen to us . " i looked up .
tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around bangalore .
i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
i watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
my gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person .
and it reminded me of something that i had just been present for .
every year or so , i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau .
and we run clinics in these very remote regions where there 's no medical care whatsoever .
and on the first day at simikot in humla , far west of nepal , the most impoverished region of nepal , an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags .
and he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes .
the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
again , the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara .
it was the young women , the health aids , who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds . i know those hands and eyes ; they touched me as well .
they touched me at that time .
they have touched me throughout my 68 years .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
she had phenomenal strength .
and it was really her strength , i believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
so we can ask : what is compassion comprised of ?
and there are various facets .
and there 's referential and non-referential compassion .
but first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
it is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that i 'm not separate from this suffering .
but that is not enough , because compassion , which activates the motor cortex , means that we aspire , we actually aspire to transform suffering .
and if we 're so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
but compassion has another component , and that component is really essential .
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
now i worked with dying people for over 40 years .
i had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security [ prison ] for six years .
and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
it is there within every human being .
but the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
i had that condition , to a certain extent , from my own childhood illness .
eve ensler , whom you 'll hear later , has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through .
and what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies , and those enemies are things like pity , moral outrage , fear .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
and in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
the very word terror is global .
the very feeling of terror is global .
so our work , in a certain way , is to address this imago , this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe .
now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities .
for example : a person who is cultivating compassion , when they are in the presence of suffering , they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do .
however , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
this is called resilience .
many of us think that compassion drains us , but i promise you it is something that truly enlivens us .
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration .
it hooks up all parts of the brain .
another , which has been discovered by various researchers at emory and at davis and so on , is that compassion enhances our immune system .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons , of the toxins of our world .
but compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobilizes our immunity .
you know , if compassion is so good for us , i have a question .
why don 't we train our children in compassion ?
if compassion is so good for us , why don 't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they 're supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
and if compassion is so good for us , why don 't we vote on compassion ?
why don 't we vote for people in our government based on compassion ,
so that we can have a more caring world ?
in buddhism , we say , " it takes a strong back and a soft front . " it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions .
and that is the mental quality of equanimity .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an undefended heart .
and the archetype of this in buddhism is avalokiteshvara , kuan-yin . it 's a female archetype : she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
she stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liberation , and in the palm of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
i say that , for thousands of years , women have lived , exemplified , met in intimacy , the archetype of avalokitesvara , of kuan-yin , she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered , unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .
they have infused societies with kindness , and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half . and they have actualized compassion through direct action .
jody williams called it : it 's good to meditate .
i 'm sorry , you 've got to do a little bit of that , jody .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
but the other side of the equation is you 've got to come out of your cave .
you have to come into the world like asanga did , who was looking to realize maitreya buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave .
he said , " i 'm out of here . " he 's going down the path .
he sees something in the path .
he looks , it 's a dog , he drops to his knees .
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
the wound is just filled with maggots .
he puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots , so as not to harm them .
and at that moment , the dog transformed into the buddha of love and kindness .
i believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men -- with their fathers , with their sons , with their brothers , with the plumbers , the road builders , the caregivers , the doctors , the lawyers , with our president , and with all beings .
the women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire .
may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere .
thank you .

a founding member of the axis of evil comedy tour , standup comic maz jobrani riffs on the challenges and conflicts of being iranian-american -- " like , part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program ; the other part thinks i can 't be trusted ... "
comedy , entertainment , politics
935
maz jobrani : did you hear the one about the iranian-american ?
i was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour .
the other founding members included ahmed ahmed , who is an egyptian-american , who actually had the idea to go to the middle east and try it out .
before we went out as a tour , he went out solo and did it first .
then there was aron kader , who was the palestinian-american .
and then there was me , the iranian-american of the group .
now , being iranian-american presents its own set of problems , as you know .
those two countries aren 't getting along these days .
so it causes a lot of inner conflict , you know , like part of me likes me , part of me hates me .
part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program , the other part thinks i can 't be trusted with one .
these are dilemmas i have every day .
but i was born in iran ; i 'm now an american citizen , which means i have the american passport , which means i can travel .
because if you only have the iranian passport , you 're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms , you know -- syria , venezuela , north korea .
so anyone who 's gotten their passport in america will tell you , when you get your passport , it still says what country you were born in .
so i remember getting my american passport .
i was like , " woohoo ! i 'm going to travel . "
and i opened it up , it said , " born in iran . " i 'm like , " oh , come on , man . "
" i 'm trying to go places . "
but what 's interesting is , i 've never had trouble traveling in any other western countries with my american passport , even though it says , " born in iran . " no problems .
where i 've had some problems is some of the arab countries , because i guess some of the arab countries aren 't getting along with iran either .
and so i was in kuwait recently , doing a comedy show with some other american comedians .
they all went through , and then the border patrol saw my american passport .
" ah ha ! american , great . "
then he opened it up . " born in iran ? wait . "
and he started asking me questions .
he said , " what is your father 's name ? "
i said , " well , he 's passed away , but his name was khosro . "
he goes , " what is your grandfather 's name ? "
i said , " he passed away a long time ago .
his name was jabbar . "
he says , " you wait . i 'll be back , " and he walked away .
and i started freaking out , because i don 't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into .
thought the guy was going to come back and be like , " we 've been looking for you for 200 years . "
" your grandfather has a parking violation . it 's way overdue .
you owe us two billion dollars . "
but as you can see , when i talk , i speak with an american accent , which you would think as an iranian-american actor , i should be able to play any part , good , bad , what have you .
but a lot of times in hollywood , when casting directors find out you 're of middle eastern descent , they go , " oh , you 're iranian . great .
can you say ' i will kill you in the name of allah ? ' " " i could say that , but what if i were to say , ' hello . i 'm your doctor ? ' "
they go , " great . and then you hijack the hospital . "
like i think you 're missing the point here .
don 't get me wrong , i don 't mind playing bad guys .
i want to play a bad guy . i want to rob a bank .
i want to rob a bank in a film . i want to rob a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , with a gun , not with a bomb strapped around me , right .
because i imagine the director : " maz , i think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him . "
" why would i do that ?
if i want the money , why would i kill myself ? "
right .
" gimme all your money , or i 'll blow myself up . "
" well , then blow yourself up .
just do it outside , please . "
but the fact is , there 's good people everywhere .
that 's what i try and show in my stand-up . there 's good people everywhere .
all it takes in one person to mess it up . like a couple months ago in times square in new york , there was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .
now , i happened to be in times square that night doing a comedy show .
and a few months before that , there was a white american guy in austin , texas who flew his airplane into the irs building , and i happened to be in austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show .
now i 'll tell you , as a middle eastern male , when you show up around a lot of these activities , you start feeling guilty at one point .
i was watching the news . i 'm like , " am i involved in this crap ? "
" i didn 't get the memo . what 's going on ? "
but what was interesting was , the pakistani muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle easterners and pakistanis from all over the world .
and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .
my question is : why would you take credit for a failed car bombing ?
" we just wanted to say we tried . "
" and furthermore , it is the thought that counts . "
" and in conclusion , win some , lose some . "
but what happened was , when the white guy flew his plane into the building , i know all my middle eastern and muslim friends in the states were watching tv , going , " please , don 't be middle eastern .
don 't be hassan . don 't be hussein . "
and the name came out jack . i 'm like , " woooo !
that 's not one of us . "
but i kept watching the news in case they came back , they were like , " before he did it , he converted to islam . "
" damn it ! why jack ? why ? "
but the fact is , i 've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world , and i did a lot of shows in the middle east .
i just did a seven-country solo tour .
i was in oman , and i was in saudi arabia .
i was in dubai .
and it 's great , there 's good people everywhere .
and you learn great things about these places .
i encourage people always to go visit these places .
for example , dubai -- cool place .
they 're obsessed with having the biggest , tallest , longest , as we all know .
they have a mall there , the dubai mall .
it is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
i was walking . i heard " beep , beep . "
i 'm like , " what are you doing here ? "
he goes , " i 'm going to the zara store . it 's three miles away .
and what 's crazy -- there 's a recession going on , even in dubai , but you wouldn 't know by the prices .
like in the dubai mall , they sell frozen yogurt by the gram .
it 's like a drug deal .
i was walking by . the guy goes , " psst . habibi , my friend . "
" you want some frozen yogurt ?
come here . come here . come here .
i have one gram , five gram , 10 gram . how many gram do you want ? "
i bought five grams . 10 dollars . 10 dollars ! i said , " what 's in this ? "
he 's like , " good stuff , man . columbian . top of the line . top of the line . " the other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the middle east , sometimes in latin american countries , south american countries -- a lot of times when they build stuff , there 's no rules and regulations .
for example , i took my two year-old son to the playground at the dubai mall .
and i 've taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the united states .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
not in the middle east .
i put my two year-old on the slide ; he went frrmrmm ! he took off . i went down . i go , " where 's my son ? "
" on the third floor , sir . on the third floor . "
" you take a taxi . you go to zara . make a left . "
" try the yogurt . it 's very good . little expensive . "
but one of the things i try to do with my stand-up is to break stereotypes .
and i 've been guilty of stereotyping as well .
i was in dubai . and there 's a lot of indians who work in dubai .
and they don 't get paid that well .
and i got it in my head that all the indians there must be workers .
and i forgot there 's obviously successful indians in dubai as well .
i was doing a show , and they said , " we 're going to send a driver to pick you up . "
so i went down to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
i go , " he 's got to be my driver . "
because he was standing there in like a cheap suit , thin mustache , staring at me .
so i went over , " excuse me , sir , are you my driver ? "
he goes , " no , sir . i own the hotel . "
i go , " i 'm sorry . then why were you staring at me ? "
he goes , " i thought you were my driver . "
i 'll leave you guys with this : i try , with my stand-up , to break stereotypes , present middle easterners in a positive light -- muslims in a positive light -- and i hope that in the coming years , more film and television programs come out of hollywood presenting us in a positive light .
who knows , maybe one day we 'll even have our own james bond , right .
" my name is bond , jamal bond . "
til then , i 'll keep telling jokes . i hope you keep laughing .
have a good day . thank you .

marco tempest : the magic of truth and lies
so the type of magic i like , and i 'm a magician , is a magic that uses technology to create illusions .
so i would like to show you something i 've been working on .
it 's an application that i think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular .
it synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices .
and i borrowed these three ipods from people here in the audience to show you what i mean .
and i 'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject : deception .
one of my favorite magicians is karl germain .
he had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .
but it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .
announcer : ladies and gentlemen , the creation of life .
marco tempest : when asked about deception , he said this : announcer : magic is the only honest profession .
a magician promises to deceive you -- and he does .
mt : i like to think of myself as an honest magician .
i use a lot of tricks , which means that sometimes i have to lie to you .
now i feel bad about that .
but people lie every day .
hold on .
girl in phone : hey , where are you ?
mt : stuck in traffic . i 'll be there soon .
you 've all done it .
lady : i 'll be ready in just a minute , darling .
man : it 's just what i 've always wanted .
woman : you were great .
mt : deception , it 's a fundamental part of life .
now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they ask told the truth .
we deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses .
the chinese general sun tzu said that all war was based on deception .
oscar wilde said the same thing of romance .
some people deceive for money .
let 's play a game .
three cards , three chances .
announcer : one five will get you 10 , 10 will get you 20 .
now where 's the lady ?
where is the queen ?
mt : this one ?
sorry . you lose .
well , i didn 't deceive you .
you deceived yourself .
self-deception .
that 's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth .
sometimes it 's hard to tell the two apart .
compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception .
they believe they can win .
they forget the times they lose .
the brain is very good at forgetting .
bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
bad experiences quickly disappear .
which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos , we are so wonderfully optimistic .
our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures ;
why we believe romeo when he says he loves juliet ;
and why single notes of music , when played together , become a sonata and conjure up meaning .
that 's " clair de lune . "
its composer called debussy said that art was the greatest deception of all .
art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth .
and when you give yourself over to that deception , it becomes magic .
thank you . thank you very much .

loretta napoleoni : the intricate economics of terrorism
i 'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
15 years ago i received a phone call from a friend .
at the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in italian jails .
he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades .
now , as many of you may remember , the red brigades was a terrorist , marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s .
as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody , not even with their lawyers .
they sat in silence through their trails , waving occasionally at family and friends .
in 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .
and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk , and tell their story .
and i was one of those people .
when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me , he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name .
in particular , one person had put it forward .
she was my childhood friend .
she had joined the red brigades and became a leader of the organization .
naturally , i didn 't know that until the day she was arrested .
in fact , i read it in the newspaper .
at the time of the phone call i just had a baby ,
i successfully completed a management buyout to the company i was working with , and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons .
but this is exactly what i did because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist , and why she 'd never tried to recruit me .
so , this is exactly what i did .
now , i found the answer very quickly . i actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist .
the center committee of the red brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist .
my friend , on the other hand , she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders .
she also embraced violence . because she believed that the only way to unblock what , at the time , was known as a blocked democracy , italy , a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
they were constantly short of cash .
they were constantly searching for cash .
now , contrary to what many people believe , terrorism is actually a very expensive business .
i 'll give you an idea .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
this is roughly between 100 and 150 million , today .
now , you know , if you live underground it 's really hard to produce this amount of money .
but this also explains why , when i was interviewing the red brigades , and then , later on , other arms organizations , including members of al-zarqawi group in the middle east , everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology , or politics .
because they had no idea .
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
all the others do , day in and day out , is search for money .
once , for example , i was interviewing this part-timer from the red brigades .
it was a psychiatrist . he loved sailing .
he was a really keen sailor . and he had this beautiful boat .
and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades
and he went sailing , every summer , back and forth from lebanon , where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo , and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms .
for that service the red brigades were actually paid a fee , which went to fund their organization .
so , because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms , all of the sudden i thought , maybe there is something here .
maybe there is a link , a commercial link , between one organization and another one .
but it was only when i interviewed mario moretti , the head of the red brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro , italian former prime minister , that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
i was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in italy . and as we were eating , i had the distinct feeling that i was back in the city of london , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
so , i decided that i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism .
naturally , nobody wanted to fund my research .
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
you know , that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money , thinking about the economics of terrorism .
so , in the end , i took a decision that , in retrospect , did change my life .
i sold my company , and funded the research myself .
and what i discovered is this parallel reality , another international economic system , which runs parallel to our own , which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii .
and what is even more shocking is that this system has followed , step by step , the evolution of our own system , of our western capitalism .
and there are three main stages .
the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
the second one is the privatization of terrorism .
and the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
so , state sponsor of terrorism , feature of the cold war . this is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy , along the periphery of the sphere of influence , fully funding arms organizations .
a mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
so , the link between crime and terror is established very early on .
and here is the best example , the contras in nicaragua , created by the cia , legally funded by the u.s. congress , illegally funded by the reagan administration via covert operation , for example , the iran-contra affair .
then comes the late 1970s , early ' 80s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
so , they gain independence from the sponsor , and start funding themselves .
now , again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities .
so , arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from bekaa valley , which is the valley between lebanon and syria .
and the ira , which control the private transportation system in northern ireland , did exactly the same thing .
so , every single time that somebody got into a taxi in belfast without knowing , actually , was funding the ira .
but the great change came , of course , with globalization and deregulation .
this is when arms organization were able to link up , also financially , with each other .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
and together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel .
this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization al qaeda .
this is an organization that can raise money across border .
but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
now , deregulation also brought back rogue economics .
so what is rogue economics ?
rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .
it comes back at times of great transformation , globalization being one of those transformations .
it is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy , and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us .
it has happened before in history .
it has happened with the fall of the roman empire .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
and it actually happened again , with the fall of the berlin wall .
now , i calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9-11 .
and it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars .
it is trillions , it 's not billions .
this is about twice the gdp of the united kingdom , soon will be more , considering where this country is going .
now , until 9-11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the u.s. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u.s. dollars
and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states .
the entry point , of course , of most of this money were the off-shore facilities .
so , this was a vital injection of cash into the u.s. economy .
now , when i went to look at the figures of the u.s. money supply ,
the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars , which , of course , reflects the growth of the economy .
so , when i went to look at those figures , i noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states , never to come back .
these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers , in cash of course .
these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
so , you see , what is the relationship ?
the united states actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world .
what does it mean ? that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .
it can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world .
this privilege is called seigniorage .
no other country can do that .
all the other countries , for example the united kingdom , can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders .
so , here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime , terror , and illegal economy , and our economy .
the u.s. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
this is how close we are with this world .
now , this situation changed , of course , after 9-11 , because george bush launched the war on terror .
part of the war on terror was the introduction of the patriot act .
now , many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
but there is a section of the patriot act which refers specifically to finance .
and it is , in fact , an anti-money-laundering legislation .
what the patriot act did was to prohibit u.s. bank , and u.s.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .
it closed that door between the money laundering in dollars , and the u.s. economy .
it also gave the u.s. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .
now , you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking .
all the bankers said to their clients , " get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else . "
now , the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
and this is what people did .
nobody wants the u.s. monetary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their clientele .
the same thing happened , of course , in the world of crime and terror .
people simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the united states into europe .
why did this happen ? this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation .
it was introduced only in the united states .
and it was introduced only for the u.s. dollars .
in europe , a similar legislation was not introduced .
so , within six months europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
so , this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror , and our own life .
so , why did i tell you this story ?
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
you got to question everything that is told to you , including what i just told you today .
this is the only way for you to step into the dark side , and have a look at it .
and believe me , it 's going to be scary .
it 's going to be frightful , but it 's going to enlighten you .
and , above all , it 's not going to be boring .

roz savage : why i 'm rowing across the pacific
hi , my name is roz savage and i row across oceans .
four years ago , i rowed solo across the atlantic , and since then , i 've done two out of three stages across the pacific , from san francisco to hawaii and from hawaii to kiribati .
and tomorrow , i 'll be leaving this boat to fly back to kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the pacific .
cumulatively , i will have rowed over 8,000 miles , taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
we have a bit of a love / hate thing going on .
i feel a bit about it like i did about a very strict math teacher that i once had at school .
i didn 't always like her , but i did respect her ,
and she taught me a heck of a lot .
so today i 'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they 've taught me , and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now .
now , some of you might be thinking , " hold on a minute . she doesn 't look very much like an ocean rower .
isn 't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys ? "
you 'll notice , they 've all got something that i don 't .
well , i don 't know what you 're thinking , but i 'm talking about the beards .
and no matter how long i 've spent on the ocean , i haven 't yet managed to muster a decent beard ,
and i hope that it remains that way .
for a long time , i didn 't believe that i could have a big adventure .
the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this .
i didn 't look the part .
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
so for 11 years , i conformed .
i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do .
i was working in an office in london as a management consultant .
and i think i knew from day one that it wasn 't the right job for me .
but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years , until i reached my mid-30s and i thought , " you know , i 'm not getting any younger .
i feel like i 've got a purpose in this life , and i don 't know what it is , but i 'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it .
so , fast forward a few years .
i 'd gone through some changes .
to try and answer that question of , " what am i supposed to be doing with my life ? "
i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary , the one that i wanted , a life of adventure , and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice , normal , pleasant life , but it wasn 't where i wanted to be by the end of my life .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , " oh boy , i 'm on totally the wrong track here .
if i carry on living as i am now , i 'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years , or 10 years , or at the end of my life . "
i made a few changes , let go of some loose trappings of my old life , and through a bit of a leap of logic , decided to row across the atlantic ocean .
the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua ,
it 's about 3,000 miles ,
and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done .
sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i 'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
and my timing was not great either :
2005 , when i did the atlantic , was the year of hurricane katrina .
there were more tropical storms in the north atlantic than ever before , since records began .
and pretty early on , those storms started making their presence known .
all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across .
oars are not supposed to look like this .
but what can you do ? you 're in the middle of the ocean . oars are your only means of propulsion .
so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on .
so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it .
then , when that gave out , i sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those .
and then when those gave out , i cannibalized one of the broken oars .
i 'd never been very good at fixing stuff when i was living my old life ,
but it 's amazing how resourceful you can become when you 're in the middle of the ocean and there 's only one way to get to the other side .
and the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits .
i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom .
i really struggled psychologically , totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge , realizing that , if i carried on moving at two miles an hour , 3,000 miles was going to take me a very , very long time .
there were so many times when i thought i 'd hit that limit , but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy .
and eventually after 103 days at sea , i arrived in antigua .
i don 't think i 've ever felt so happy in my entire life .
it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one .
i was euphoric .
and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering , i just felt like a movie star .
it was absolutely wonderful .
and i really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it .
so this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind .
number one that i get asked : what do you eat ?
a few freeze-dried meals , but mostly i try and eat much more unprocessed foods .
so i grow my own beansprouts .
i eat fruits and nut bars , a lot of nuts . and generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
with my eyes shut . ha-ha .
i suppose what you mean is : what happens to the boat while i 'm sleeping ?
well , i plan my route so that i 'm drifting with the winds and the currents while i 'm sleeping .
on a good night , i think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction .
worst ever , 13 miles in the wrong direction .
that 's a bad day at the office .
what do i wear ?
mostly , a baseball cap , rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown , depending on whether i went backwards overnight --
and lots of sun lotion .
do i have a chase boat ?
no i don 't . i 'm totally self-supporting out there .
i don 't see anybody for the whole time that i 'm at sea , generally .
and finally : am i crazy ?
well , i leave that one up to you to judge .
so , how do you top rowing across the atlantic ?
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really , really big .
i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps . i don 't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle ,
and we 've cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world . whereas if you look in google earth , this is how the pacific looks .
it pretty much covers half the planet .
you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there .
it is really big --
65 million square miles --
and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles .
unfortunately , ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line .
by the time i get to australia , if i get to australia , i will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all .
so , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in , i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .
the first attempt didn 't go so well .
in 2007 , i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours .
a bit like being in a washing machine .
boat got a bit dinged up , so did i .
i blogged about it . unfortunately , somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving .
the first i knew about this was when the coast guard plane turned up overhead .
i tried to tell them to go away .
we had a bit of a battle of wills .
i lost and got airlifted .
awful , really awful .
it was one of the worst feelings of my life ,
as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if i would ever see her again .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
but what do you do ?
fall down nine times , get up 10 .
so , the following year , i set out and , fortunately , this time made it safely across to hawaii .
but it was not without misadventure .
my watermaker broke ,
only the most important piece of kit that i have on the boat .
powered by my solar panels , it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater .
but it doesn 't react very well to being immersed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
fortunately , help was at hand .
there was another unusual boat out there at the same time , doing as i was doing , bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch , that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre .
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .
they were going very slowly .
partly , they 'd had a bit of a delay .
they 'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone , and they were starting to sink .
so they 'd had to pull in and do all the lids up .
but , as i was approaching the end of my water reserves , luckily , our courses were converging .
they were running out of food ; i was running out of water .
so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up .
and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge .
i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 :
it was like two snails in a mating dance .
but , eventually , we did manage to meet up and joel hopped overboard , caught us a beautiful , big mahi-mahi , which was the best food i 'd had in , ooh , at least three months .
fortunately , the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier .
when they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance .
it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it , and then we come along and eat that poor critter , and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well .
so there are very real implications for human health .
i eventually made it to hawaii still alive .
and , the following year , set out on the second stage of the pacific , from hawaii down to tarawa .
and you 'll notice something about tarawa ; it is very low-lying .
it 's that little green sliver on the horizon ,
which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
this is big trouble for these guys .
they 've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level .
and also , as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change , they 're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef , which will contaminate their fresh water supply .
i had a meeting with the president there , who told me about his exit strategy for his country .
he expects that within the next 50 years , the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to new zealand or australia .
and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves ;
if the places where i 'd been born and gone to school and got married , if all those places were just going to disappear forever . how , literally , ungrounded that would make me feel .
very shortly , i 'll be setting out to try and get to australia , and if i 'm successful , i 'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the pacific .
and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
if the atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
i think there are probably three key points here .
the first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves .
for so long , i told myself that i couldn 't have an adventure because i wasn 't six foot tall and athletic and bearded .
and then that story changed .
i found out that people had rowed across oceans .
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
so even though i didn 't grow any taller , i didn 't sprout a beard , something had changed : my interior dialogue had changed .
at the moment , the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff , that we need oil .
but what about if we just change that story ?
we do have alternatives ,
and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives , those sustainable ones , to create a greener future .
the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions .
we might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean , that it can 't really make a difference .
but it does . generally , we haven 't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters .
yes , there have been the exxon valdezes and the chernobyls , but mostly it 's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals , day after day and year after year .
and , by the same token , we can turn that tide .
we can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions .
and when we do that , we 're not just one person .
anything that we do spreads ripples .
other people will see if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
maybe if we all start doing this , we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line .
that 's just one example .
this is a world-wide community .
the other point : it 's about taking responsibility .
for so much of my life , i wanted something else to make me happy .
i thought if i had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life , then i could be happy .
but when i wrote that obituary exercise , i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future .
i couldn 't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me .
and i suppose i 'm a selfish environmentalist . i plan on being around for a long time , and when i 'm 90 years old , i want to be happy and healthy .
and it 's very difficult to be happy on a planet that 's racked with famine and drought .
it 's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we 've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
so , shortly , i 'm going to be launching a new initiative called eco-heroes .
and the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day .
it 's meant to be a bit of a game .
we 're going to make an iphone app out of it .
we just want to try and create that awareness because , sure , changing a light bulb isn 't going to change the world , but that attitude , that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug , that is what could change the world .
i really believe that we stand at a very important point in history .
we have a choice . we 've been blessed , or cursed , with free will .
we can choose a greener future ,
and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time .
thank you .

reed kroloff on modern and romantic architecture
to be new at ted -- it 's like being the last high-school virgin .
you know that all of the cool people are -- they 're doing it .
and you 're on the outside , you 're at home . you 're like the raspyni brothers , where you 've got your balls in cold water . and -- -- you just play with your fingers all day . and then you get invited .
and you 're on the inside , and it 's everything you hoped it would be .
it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over . and it 's only taken five minutes .
and you want to go back and do it again . but i really appreciate being here . and thank you , chris , and also , thank you , deborah patton , for making this possible .
so anyway , today we 'll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
and if you put creation and optimism together , you 've got two choices that you can talk about .
you can talk about creationism -- which i think wouldn 't go down well with this audience , at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations , spelled the british way , with an s , instead of a z .
and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today .
but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up ted , small-scale architecture -- at the present time can 't really happen without a conversation about this , the world trade center , and what 's been going on there , what it means to us .
because if architecture is what i believe it to be , which is the built form of our cultural ambitions , what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else 's cultural ambitions relative to us ? and our own opportunity to make something new there ?
this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .
i think that the world trade center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that i don 't think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
i don 't remember , in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture , a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning , fire exiting , safety concerns and whether carpet burns .
these are just not things we talked about very often .
and yet , now , it 's talked about all the time .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way , we 're going to think about it like this .
how many of you saw usa today , today ? there it is . looks like that .
there 's the world trade center site , on the front cover .
they 've made a selection .
they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind , the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture .
child-prodigy piano player , he started on the squeezebox , and moved to a little more serious issue , a bigger instrument , and now to an even larger instrument , upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic , as you see here .
he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition , after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go , " oh , i 'm really sorry , we screwed up . "
right . can we do this again from the top , except use some people with a vague hint of talent , instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time , real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities .
let 's bring in some real architects for a change .
and so we got this , or we had a choice of that . oh , stop clapping .
it 's too late . that is gone .
this was a scheme by a team called think , a new york-based team , and then there was that one , which was the libeskind scheme .
this one , this is going to be the new world trade center :
a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it .
now , i don 't know what you think , but i think this is a pretty stupid decision , because what you 've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever .
but that 's what we 're going to do .
but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically .
and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects , in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large , technical answer that can solve all problems , be they social , be they physical , be they chemical -- or something that 's more of a romantic solution .
now , i don 't mean romantic as in , this is a nice place to take someone on a date .
i mean romantic in the sense of , there are things larger and grander than us .
so , in the american tradition , the difference between the technocratic and the romantic , would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states , that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states , as a really , truly , technocratic solution , a bowing to the -- in jefferson 's time -- current , popular philosophy of rationalism .
or the way we went to describe that later : manifest destiny .
now , which would you rather be ? a grid , or manifest destiny ?
manifest destiny .
it 's a big deal . it sounds big , it sounds important , it sounds solid . it sounds american . ballsy , serious , male .
and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
we all want to go out and buy an audi tt , don 't we ?
everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one .
and then they hopped in it , turned the little electronic key , rather than the real key , zipped home on their new superhighway , and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
why do we all want to do that ? i even owned a tudor thing once myself .
it 's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger , sort of more romantic image of where we are .
so we 're going to go straight into this .
can i have the lights off for a moment ?
i 'm going to talk about two architects very , very briefly that represent the current split , architecturally , between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution .
and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today . one very young , one a little more mature .
this is the work of a firm called shop , and what you 're seeing here , is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park .
does everybody know what a camera obscura is ?
yeah , it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it 's sort of a little movie , without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .
this is just the outline of it , and you can see , does it look like a regular building ? no .
it 's actually non-orthogonal : it 's not up and down , square , rectangular , anything like that , that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building .
the computer revolution , the technocratic , technological revolution , has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings , traditionally shaped buildings , in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this .
what 's interesting about it is not the shape .
what 's interesting about it is how it 's made . how it 's made .
a brand-new way to put buildings together , something called mass customization . no , it is not an oxymoron .
what makes the building expensive , in the traditional sense , is making individual parts custom , that you can 't do over and over again .
that 's why we all live in developer houses .
they all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times .
that 's because it 's cheaper .
mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer , a program that says , manufacture these parts .
the computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment 's notice ,
because the computer is just a machine .
it doesn 't care . it 's manufacturing the parts .
it doesn 't see any excess cost . it doesn 't spend any extra time .
it 's not a laborer -- it 's simply an electronic lathe , so the parts can all be cut at the same time .
meanwhile , instead of sending someone working drawings , which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life , what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions , like you used to get when you were a child , when you bought little models that said , " bolt a to b , and c to d. "
and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site , to that builder , and a set of these instruction manuals .
just simple " bolt a to b " and they will be able to put them together . here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that 's what will happen in the end .
you 're underneath it , looking up into the lens of the camera obscura .
lest you think this is all fiction , lest you think this is all fantasy , or romance , these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 , which is a museum in brooklyn , new york , as part of their young architects summer series .
and they said , well , it 's summer , what do you do ?
in the summer , you go to the beach .
and when you go to the beach , what do you get ? you get sand dunes .
so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .
they took photographs , they fed the photographs into their computer program , and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions , using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood .
and those are the pieces of wood . those are the instructions .
these are the pieces , and here 's a little of that blown up .
what you can see is there 's about six different colors , and each color represents a type of wood to be cut , a piece of wood to be cut .
all of which were delivered by flat bed , on a truck , and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people , only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
and here comes dune-scape , coming up out of the courtyard , and there it is fully built .
there are only 16 different pieces of wood ,
only 16 different assembly parts here .
looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside .
it has its own built-in swimming pool , very , very cool .
it 's a great place for parties -- it was , it was only up for six weeks . it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas , where lots of interesting things went on , all summer long .
now , lest you think that this is only for the light at heart , or just temporary installations , this is the same firm working at the world trade center , replacing the bridge that used to go across west street , that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side .
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufactured .
and they were able to do it . that was their design , using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts , a couple of struts , like this , some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck .
they were able to create that .
they were able to create something wonderful .
they 're now building a 16-story building on the side of new york , using the same technology .
here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night . it 's self-lit , you don 't need any overhead lighting , so the neighbors don 't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face .
here it is going across . and there , down the other side , and you get the same kind of grandeur .
now , let me show you , quickly , the opposite , if i may .
woo , pretty , huh . this is the other side of the coin .
this is the work of david rockwell from new york city , whose work you can see out here today .
the current king of the romantics , who approaches his work in a very different fashion .
it 's not to create a technological solution , it 's to seduce you into something that you can do , into something that will please you , something that will lift your spirits , something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his nobu restaurant in new york , which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition .
" when it 's all said and done , it 's got to look like seaweed , " said the owner .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
i want you to know the room you 're looking at is stark white .
every single surface of this restaurant is white .
the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting .
it 's all about sensuality . it 's all about transforming .
watch this -- i 'm not touching any buttons , ladies and gentlemen .
this is happening by itself .
it transforms through the magic of lighting .
it 's all about sensuality . it 's all about touch .
rosa mexicano restaurant , where he transports us to the shores of acapulco , up on the upper west side , with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go , like that .
let 's see it one more time .
okay , just to make sure that you 've enjoyed it .
and finally , it 's about comfort , it 's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn 't have felt good before .
it 's about bringing nature to the inside .
in the guardian tower of new york , converted to a w union square -- i 'm sorry i 'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself .
it 's about stimulation .
this is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste . fizzy , fresh , soft , luscious , juicy , smooth , big and sweet wines , all explained to you by color and texture on the wall . and finally , it 's about entertainment , as in his headquarters for the cirque du soleil , orlando , florida , where you 're asked to enter the greek theater , look under the tent and join the magic world of cirque du soleil .
and i think i 'll probably leave it at that . thank you very much .

eddi reader sings " kiteflyer 's hill "
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer 's hill where i used to go and spend hours going " when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? "
so this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who i 've got over .
but this is " kiteflyer 's hill . "
it 's a beautiful song written by a guy called martin evan , actually , for me .
boo hewerdine , thomas dolby ,

ravin agrawal : 10 young indian artists to watch
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .
contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before .
i thought it might be interesting , even for the many long-time collectors here with us at ted , local collectors , to have an outside view of 10 young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know .
the first is bharti kher .
the central motif of bharti 's practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche , as she calls it , by exploding it into something spectacular .
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
she says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis , and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand .
our next artist , balasubramaniam , really stands at the crossroads of sculpture , painting and installation , working wonders with fiberglass .
since bala himself will be speaking at ted i won 't spend too much time on him here today , except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible .
brooklyn-based chitra ganesh is known for her digital collages , using indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material .
these comics are a fundamental way that children , especially in the diaspora , learn their religious and mythological folk tales .
i , for one , was steeped in these .
chitra basically remixes and re-titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics .
and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
as you can see , he 's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art , and his home city of mumbai is an ever-present element in his work .
he really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban bombay .
he also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin .
here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot .
this next artist , n.s. harsha , actually has a studio right here in mysore .
he 's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .
he creates these fine , delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect , whether on the roof of a temple in singapore , or in his increasingly ambitious installation work , here with 192 functioning sewing machines , fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations .
mumbai-based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women .
she too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas , but in a very different way than chitra ganesh .
in this particular work , she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen , and provocative .
raqib shaw is kolkata-born , kashmir-raised , and london-trained .
he too is reinventing the miniature tradition .
he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch , but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth .
he actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect .
i 'm kind of cheating with this next artist since raqs media collective are really three artists working together .
raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in india today , working across photography , video and installation .
they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization , and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work .
here , they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens , in which the city itself may have been the culprit .
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art , subodh gupta .
he was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases , paintings of everyday objects , the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian .
he celebrates these local and mundane objects globally , and on a grander and grander scale , by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations .
and finally number 10 , last and certainly not least , ranjani shettar , who lives and works here in the state of karnataka , creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial , and brings , like subodh , the local global .
these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye .
and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space , and interact with the objects .
and light and shadow are a very important part of her work .
she also explores themes of consumerism , and the environment , such as in this work , where these basket-like objects look organic and woven , and are woven , but with the strips of steel , salvaged from cars that she found in a bangalore junkyard .
10 artists , six minutes , i know that was a lot to take in .
but i can only hope i 've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .
thank you very much for looking and listening .

al seckel says our brains are mis-wired
we 're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture , just for ted -- and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted , and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness -- or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there 's something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it 's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way . you go see a movie . and it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn 't expect -- and you find a joyful experience . you look at those sort of illusions in my book and it 's not as what you 'd expect . and there 's something joyful about it . and it 's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . so , what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if i can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . i mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but i 'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so i can make the audience here happy .
so i 'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations . first of all , i want to show you the particular illusion here . i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other . these are all perceptual tricks . these are real objects that i 'm going to show you . now i 'm going to show you how it is done . i 've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience . i want you to see how this illusion is constructed , and it 's going to rotate so you see that it 's inside out . now watch , as it rotates back , how quickly your perception snaps . ok now .
watch it as it rotates back again . and this is a very bright audience , all right ? see if you can stop it from happening , even though you know 100 percent it 's true that -- bam ! you can 't undo it . what does that tell you about yourselves ? we 're going to do it again . no doubt about it . see if you can stop it from happening . no . it 's difficult .
and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation , about shape , about color and so forth and it 's very primal . and
it 's an interesting question to ponder , why these things -- we find these things joyful . why would we find them joyful ? so , here 's something that
lionel did a while ago . i like these sort of
little things like this .
again , this is not an optical trick . this is what you would see . in other words , it 's not a camera cut . it 's a perceptual trick .
ok . we can violate your expectations about shape .
we can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents . what do you see here ?
how many of you here see dolphins ? raise your hand if you see dolphins . ok , those people who raised their hands , afterwards , the rest of the audience , go talk to them , all right ? actually , this is the best example of priming by experience that i know .
if you are a child under the age of 10 who haven 't been ruined yet , you will look at this image and see dolphins . now , some of you adults here are saying , " what dolphins ? what dolphins ? "
but in fact , if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words , the dark areas here -- i forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it , you 'll see a whole series of little dolphins . by the way , if you 're also a student at caltech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins . it 's based on experience .
now , something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design , too . this was done by saatchi and saatchi , and they actually got away with this ad in australia . so , if you look at this ad for beer , all those people are in sort of provocative positions . but they got it passed , and actually won the clio awards , so it 's funny how you can do these things .
remember that sort of , um . this is the joke i did when the florida ballot was going around . you know , count the dots for gore ; count the dots for bush ; count ' em again ...
you can violate your expectations about experience . here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine , but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate . this is something we 're building for , you know , amusement parks and that kind of stuff .
now let 's take a static image . can you see this ?
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
right . now , when -- it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . but the whole thing is actually flat . it 's painted . it 's trompe l 'oeil .
and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn 't respond .
now , you can make design mistakes . like this building in new york . so that when you see it from this side , it looks like the balconies tilt up , and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down . so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , " is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? " and i really say , " no . " i mean , women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn 't they ? however , this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males : in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues . they can match the hat .
okay , now getting to a part -- i want to show design in illusions . i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye . so that when you saw from one little angle was like
this . and this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .
but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with hans holbein 's " ambassadors . " and hans holbein worked for henry viii . this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull .
all right , now i 'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise . one of my favorites is scott kim . i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted that i hope you will enjoy . we have one here on ted and happiness .
ok now . arthur [ ganson ] hasn 't talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . and so , we -- scott created this wonderful tribute to arthur ganson .
well , there 's analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
and figure goes to ground . and for the musicians .
and of course , since happiness -- we want " joy to the world . " now , another great designer -- he 's very well known in japan -- shigeo fukuda . and he just builds some fantastic things . this is simply amazing . this is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle , you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano .
pianist transforms to violinist .
this is really wild . this assemblage of forks , knives and spoons and various cutlery , welded together . it gives a shadow of a motorcycle . you learn something in the sort of thing that i do , which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands .
ken knowlton does wonderful composite images , like creating jacques cousteau out of seashells -- un-retouched seashells , but just by rearranging
them . he did einstein out of dice because , after all , einstein said , " god does not play dice with the universe . " bert herzog out of un-retouched keyboards . will shortz , crossword puzzle . john
cederquist does these wonderful trompe l 'oeil cabinets .
now , i 'm going to skip ahead since i 'm sort of running
[ behind ] . i want to show you quickly what i 've
created , some new type of illusions . i 've done something with taking the pixar-type illusions . so you see these kids the same size here , running down the hall . the two table tops of the same size .
they 're looking out two directions at once . you
have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller . and
that 's something for you to think about , all
right ? so you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here . does everyone see that ? which is impossible . you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different
directions at once . now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape ? they are .
so , if you measured them , they would be . and as i say , those two figures are identical in size and shape .
and it 's interesting , by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion , how much stronger the illusions are . any case , i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness , and if you 're interested in seeing more cool effects , see me outside . i 'd be happy to show you lots of things .

eric berlow : how complexity leads to simplicity
do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you 're faced with a complex problem ?
well , i hope to change that in less than three minutes .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn 't always equal complicated .
so for me , a well-crafted baguette , fresh out of the oven , is complex , but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated .
i 'm an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
and i study that in the natural world , the interconnectedness of species .
so here 's a food web , or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california .
and this is what happens to that food web when it 's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before .
all the grayed-out species disappear .
some are actually on the brink of extinction .
and lakes with fish have more mosquitoes , even though they eat them .
these effects were all unanticipated , and yet we 're discovering they 're predictable .
so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we 're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn 't think of before .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park .
the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another , if you focus only on that link , and then you black box the rest , it 's actually less predictable than if you step back , consider the entire system -- all the species , all the links -- and from that place , hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .
and we 're discovering , with our research , that 's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees .
so the more you step back , embrace complexity , the better chance you have of finding simple answers , and it 's often different than the simple answer that you started with .
so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u.s. government .
this is a diagram of the u.s. counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan .
it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago . instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated .
and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government .
clearly a complex problem , but is it complicated ?
well , when i saw this in the front page of the times , i thought , " great . finally something i can relate to .
i can sink my teeth into this . "
so let 's do it . so here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network .
the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
and so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence .
within that sphere , most of those nodes are not actionable , like the harshness of the terrain , and a very small minority are actual military actions .
most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories : active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair , transparent economic development and provisioning of services .
i don 't know about this , but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds .
when you see a diagram like this , i don 't want you to be afraid .
i want you to be excited . i want you to be relieved .
because simple answers may emerge .
we 're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity .
so for any problem , the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity , the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most .
thank you .

margaret wertheim : the beautiful math of coral
i 'm here today , as june said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years .
we 're crocheting a coral reef .
and it 's a project that we 've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
it 's a project that now reaches across three continents ,
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics , marine biology , feminine handicraft and environmental activism .
it 's true .
it 's also a project that in a very beautiful way , the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth , which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in february 2009 -- which , as one of our previous speakers told us , is the 200th anniversary of the birth of charles darwin .
all of this i 'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes , i hope .
but let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across ,
and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
this is some more images of it .
that one on the right is about five feet high .
the work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
and indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this .
the totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
my sister and i started this project in 2005 because in that year , at least in the science press , there was a lot of talk about global warming , and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs .
corals are very delicate organisms ,
and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures .
it causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick .
and if the bleaching doesn 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
a great deal of this has been happening in the great barrier reef , particularly in coral reefs all over the world .
this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .
we have a new organization together called the institute for figuring , which is a little organization we started to promote , to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics .
and i went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
to our surprise , one of the first people who called was the andy warhol museum .
and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global warming , and they 'd like our coral reef to be part of it .
i laughed and said , " well we 've only just started it , you can have a little bit of it . " so in 2007 we had an exhibition , a small exhibition of this crochet reef .
and then some people in chicago came along and they said , " in late 2007 , the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming . and we 've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . " and i , naively by this stage , said , " oh , yes , sure . " now i say " naively " because actually my profession is as a science writer .
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .
i 've written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times .
so i had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
so i said yes to this proposition .
and i went home , and i told my sister christine .
and she nearly had a fit because christine is a professor at one of l.a. ' s major art colleges , calarts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
she thought i 'd gone off my head .
but she went into crochet overdrive .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center 's 3,000 square foot gallery .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
the people in chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs , what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef .
so we went and taught the techniques . we did workshops and lectures . and the people in chicago made a reef of their own .
and it was exhibited alongside ours .
there were hundreds of people involved in that .
we got invited to do the whole thing in new york , and in london , and in los angeles .
in each of these cities , the local citizens , hundreds and hundreds of them , have made a reef .
and more and more people get involved in this , most of whom we 've never met .
so the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic , ever-evolving creature , that 's actually gone way beyond christine and i .
now some of you are sitting here thinking , " what planet are these people on ?
why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
woolenness and wetness aren 't exactly two concepts that go together .
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
cast it in bronze . " but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure .
the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals , and kelps , and sponges and nudibranchs , is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .
and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet . it happens to be a fact .
it 's almost impossible to model this structure any other way ,
and it 's almost impossible to do it on computers .
so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody ?
the next few minutes is , we 're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug .
this sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century .
but not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .
in 1997 a mathematician at cornell , daina taimina , made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet .
the first one she did was knitting .
but you get too many stitches on the needle . so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing .
but what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure , that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model .
and indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se .
some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?
before hyperbolic geometry , mathematicians knew about two kinds of space : euclidean space , and spherical space .
and they have different properties .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , euclidean space is .
but mathematicians formalize this in a particular way .
and what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
so here we have a line and a point outside the line .
and euclid said , " how can i define parallel lines ?
i ask the question , how many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line ? " and you all know the answer . does someone want to shout it out ?
one . great . okay .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
it 's a definition really of euclidean space .
but there is another possibility that you all know of : spherical space .
think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball , the surface of the earth .
i have a straight line on my spherical surface .
and i have a point outside the line . how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface ?
now mathematicians have answered that question .
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it 's called a geodesic .
and on the surface of a sphere , a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .
so it 's like the equator or the lines of longitude .
so we ask the question again , " how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? " does someone want to guess ?
zero . very good .
now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative .
it 's a bit suspicious isn 't it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
two answers ? there may possibly be a third alternative .
to a mathematician if there are two answers , and the first two are zero and one , there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .
does anyone want to guess what it is ?
infinity . you all got it right . exactly .
there is , there 's a third alternative .
this is what it looks like .
there 's a straight line , and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line .
this is the drawing .
this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they 're sitting there feeling bamboozled . thinking , how can that be ? you 're cheating . the lines are curved .
but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a flat surface .
mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this .
how could they see this ?
what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered euclidean space .
then our mathematicians come along and said , " there 's this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . " but you don 't know what a sphere looks like .
and someone that comes along and says , " look here 's a ball . " and you go , " ah ! i can see it . i can feel it . i can touch it . i can play with it . " and that 's exactly what happened when daina taimina in 1997 , showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
i 've stitched euclid 's parallel postulate on to the surface .
and the lines look curved .
but look , i can prove to you that they 're straight because i can take any one of these lines , and i can fold along it .
and it 's a straight line .
so here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
and you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces .
the discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-euclidean geometry .
and this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe .
so there is this direct line between feminine handicraft , euclid and general relativity .
now , i said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible .
here 's two creatures who 've never heard of euclid 's parallel postulate -- didn 't know it was impossible to violate , and they 're simply getting on with it .
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .
their answer was interesting .
they said , " well i guess there aren 't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs . " and that 's true . but it also goes deeper than that .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was ,
what they thought it could and couldn 't do ,
what they thought it could and couldn 't represent .
even mathematicians , who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers , literally couldn 't see not only the sea slugs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those curly vegetables , they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry .
and so in some sense they literally , they had such a symbolic view of mathematics , they couldn 't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them .
it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders .
and so , too , we 've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .
we started out , chrissy and i and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
and all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own embellishments .
as it were , we have this ever-evolving , crochet taxonomic tree of life .
just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending , little embellishments and complexifications in the dna code lead to new things like giraffes , or orchids --
so too , do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life .
so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
there is the totality of all the people who have come to it . and their individual visions , and their engagement with this mathematical mode .
we have these technologies . we use them .
but why ? what 's at stake here ? what does it matter ?
for chrissy and i , one of the things that 's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge .
we live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations , equations , codes .
we live in a society that 's obsessed with presenting information in this way , teaching information in this way .
but through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics ,
which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space .
but you can do it through playing with material objects .
one of the ways that we 've come to think about this is that what we 're trying to do with the institute for figuring and projects like this , we 're trying to have kindergarten for grown-ups .
and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education , established by a man named friedrich froebel , who was a crystallographer in the 19th century .
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
he developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .
and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
the value of education is something that froebel championed , through plastic modes of play .
we live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks , where great minds go to think about the world .
they write these great symbolic treatises called books , and papers , and op-ed articles .
we want to propose , chrissy and i , through the institute for figuring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
but what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . -- all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
thank you very much .

vilayanur ramachandran tells us what brain damage can reveal about the connection between celebral tissue and the mind , using three startling delusions as examples .

vs ramachandran on your mind
well , as chris pointed out , i study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
and i just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
and this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which i think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we 'll understand how that happens .
ok , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
i mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
how does this happen ?
well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
one approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there 's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
what then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
what you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry 's doing to generate that particular function .
so that 's what we 're trying to do .
so let me give you a few striking examples of this .
in fact , i 'm giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome .
if you look at the first slide there , that 's the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , ok -- the lobes that constitute the brain .
and if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can 't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
and that 's been called the face area in the brain , because when it 's damaged , you can no longer recognize people 's faces .
you can still recognize them from their voice and say , " oh yeah , that 's joe , " but you can 't look at their face and know who it is , right ?
you can 't even recognize yourself in the mirror .
i mean , you know it 's you because you wink and it winks , and you know it 's a mirror , but you don 't really recognize yourself as yourself .
ok . now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
but there 's another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
this is called the capgras delusion ,
and that is a patient , who 's otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma ,
otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , " this looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she 's an impostor . she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother . " now , why does this happen ?
why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it 's not mother .
now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a freudian view , and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but i 'll just talk about guys . when you 're a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
this is the so-called oedipus complex of freud .
i 'm not saying i believe this , but this is the standard freudian view .
and then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
thank god , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
and then what happens is , there 's a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
and you say , " my god , if this is my mom , how come i 'm being sexually turned on ?
she 's some other woman . she 's an impostor . " it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
it 's very ingenious , as all freudian arguments are --
-- but didn 't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle .
he 'll say , " doctor , this is not fifi . it looks exactly like fifi , but it 's some other dog . " right ?
now , you try using the freudian explanation there .
you 'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
now , what 's really going on ?
so , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
you can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
i talked about that earlier .
now , when that area 's damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
but from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you 're looking at .
is it prey ? is it predator ? is it mate ?
or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a -- i don 't want to point to that , but --
or a shoe , or something like that ? ok ?
which you can completely ignore .
so if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
your heart starts beating faster . you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you 're going to create from muscular exertion .
and that 's fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
so i can determine , when you 're looking at something , whether you 're excited or whether you 're aroused , or not , ok ?
and i 'll get to that in a minute .
so my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his -- any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it 's processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , ok ?
and then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
but maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
so because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , " oh yeah , this looks like my mother . " but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , " but how come , if it 's my mother , i don 't experience a warmth ? " or terror , as the case may be ? right ?
and therefore , he says , " how do i account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
this can 't be my mother .
it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother . " how do you test this ?
well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , i can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . of course , you don 't sweat .
if i show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
and , believe it or not , if i show you a picture of your mother --
i 'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating .
you don 't even have to be jewish .
now , what happens if you show this patient ?
you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
there 's no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal -- he 'll laugh , he 'll cry , so on and so forth -- but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
it 's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
by the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone , and he says , " wow , mom , how are you ? where are you ? " there 's no delusion through the phone .
then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , " who are you ?
you look just like my mother . " ok ?
the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that 's not been cut by the accident .
so this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
when he sees her in person , he says it 's an impostor .
ok , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
and you all know what a phantom limb is .
when an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war -- for example , in the iraq war , it 's now a serious problem -- you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that 's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
in fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
i 've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy -- who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
and in fact , one student asked me the other day , " do they get phantom pms ? " a subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven 't pursued that .
ok , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
one of the things we 've found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
it 'll pat his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave goodbye .
these are very compelling , vivid sensations .
the patient 's not delusional .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it 's a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
but however , about half the patients , this doesn 't happen .
the phantom limb -- they 'll say , " but doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful .
if only i could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . " now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
it sounds like an oxymoron .
but when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
so the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
and this is a serious clinical problem .
patients become depressed .
some of them are driven to suicide , ok ?
so , how do you treat this syndrome ?
now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
when i looked at the case sheet , i found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
why does this happen ?
when the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , " move , " but it 's getting visual feedback saying , " no . " move . no . move . no . move . no .
and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain ,
and we call this learned paralysis , ok ?
the brain learns , because of this hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm . and then , when you 've amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , ok ?
now , how do you help these patients ?
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it 's obeying his command , right ?
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
how do you do that ? well , virtual reality .
but that costs millions of dollars .
so , i hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don 't tell my funding agencies .
ok ? what you do is you create what i call a mirror box .
you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient , derek , came in .
he had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
he had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
he had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn 't move it .
it was a paralyzed phantom arm .
so he came there , and i gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which i call a mirror box , right ?
and the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . and what does he experience ?
he looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he 's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
" now , " i said , " now , look , wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . " he 's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
that 's obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , " oh my god , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . " and remember , my first patient who came in -- -- thank you .
my first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and i said , " look at your reflection of your phantom . " and he started giggling , he says , " i can see my phantom . " but he 's not stupid . he knows it 's not real .
he knows it 's a mirror reflection , but it 's a vivid sensory experience .
now , i said , " move your normal hand and phantom . " he said , " oh , i can 't move my phantom . you know that . it 's painful . " i said , " move your normal hand . " and he says , " oh my god , my phantom is moving again . i don 't believe this !
and my pain is being relieved . " ok ?
and then i said , " close your eyes . " he closes his eyes .
" and move your normal hand . " " oh , nothing . it 's clenched again . " " ok , open your eyes . " " oh my god , oh my god , it 's moving again ! " so , he was like a kid in a candy store .
so , i said , ok , this proves my theory about learned paralysis
and the critical role of visual input ,
but i 'm not going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
it 's a completely useless ability , if you think about it .
but then i started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
so , i said , " look , derek " -- well , first of all , the guy can 't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- i said , " look , derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . " so he said ok , and he took it home .
i said , " look , it 's , after all , two dollars . take it home . " so , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , " doctor , you 're not going to believe this . " i said , " what ? " he said , " it 's gone . " i said , " what 's gone ? " i thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
he said , " no , no , no , you know this phantom i 've had for the last 10 years ?
it 's disappeared . " and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i 've changed this guy 's body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
and i said , " derek , does this bother you ? " he said , " no , last three days , i 've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
but the problem is i still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn 't reach . " " so , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so i can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? " he thought i was some kind of magician .
now , why does this happen ?
it 's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
it 's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
on the other hand , there 's no appropriate reception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
and your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
it goes into a sort of denial -- negates the signals .
and when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can 't have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
so , that 's the bonus .
now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
but , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
this has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
ok , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
he was a cousin of charles darwin .
he pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it 's colored .
five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , ok ?
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
or c sharp -- sometimes , tones evoke color .
c sharp is blue , f sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
why does this happen ?
this is called synesthesia . galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
in us , all the senses are distinct .
these people muddle up their senses .
why does this happen ?
one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
synesthesia runs in families , so galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
secondly , synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity -- synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
why would that be ?
i 'm going to answer that question .
it 's never been answered before .
ok , what is synesthesia ? what causes it ?
well , there are many theories .
one theory is they 're just crazy .
now , that 's not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
now , there may be some truth to this , because it 's much more common here in the bay area than in san diego .
ok . now , the third theory is that -- well , let 's ask ourselves what 's really going on in synesthesia . all right ?
so , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
so we said , there 's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
so , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that 's why you get synesthesia .
now remember -- why does this happen ?
why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
remember i said it runs in families ?
that gives you the clue . and that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
so , if there 's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas . and if it 's between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
if it 's between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
so far , so good .
now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , " it is the east , and juliet is the sun . " well , you don 't say , juliet is the sun , does that mean she 's a glowing ball of fire ?
i mean , schizophrenics do that , but it 's a different story , right ?
normal people say , she 's warm like the sun , she 's radiant like the sun , she 's nurturing like the sun .
instantly , you 've found the links .
now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it 's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
and , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
ok , it 's a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
the last demonstration -- can i take one minute ?
ok . i 'm going to show you that you 're all synesthetes , but you 're in denial about it .
here 's what i call martian alphabet . just like your alphabet , a is a , b is b , c is c. different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
here , you 've got martian alphabet .
one of them is kiki , one of them is buba .
which one is kiki and which one is buba ?
how many of you think that 's kiki and that 's buba ? raise your hands .
well , it 's one or two mutants .
how many of you think that 's buba , that 's kiki ? raise your hands .
ninety-nine percent of you .
now , none of you is a martian . how did you do that ?
it 's because you 're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you 're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
now , this is very important , because what it 's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it 's just -- it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
it 's a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that 's damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in buba kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
if you ask this guy , what -- " all that glitters is not gold , " what does that mean ? " the patient says , " well , if it 's metallic and shiny , it doesn 't mean it 's gold . you have to measure its specific gravity , ok ? "
so , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
so , this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower primates .
something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it 's the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . and something very interesting is going on .
and i think it 's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
all of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
thank you .

martin rees asks : is this our final century ?
if you take 10,000 people at random , 9,999 have something in common : their interests in business lie on or near the earth 's surface .
the odd one out is an astronomer , and i am one of that strange breed .
my talk will be in two parts . i 'll talk first as an astronomer , and then as a worried member of the human race .
but let 's start off by remembering that darwin showed how we 're the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning , to set our earth in a cosmic context .
and let me just run through a few slides .
this was the impact that happened last week on a comet .
if they 'd sent a nuke , it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday .
so that 's another project for nasa .
that 's mars from the european mars express , and at new year .
this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan , saturn 's giant moon .
it landed on the surface . this is pictures taken on the way down .
that looks like a coastline .
it is indeed , but the ocean is liquid methane -- the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade .
if we go beyond our solar system , we 've learned that the stars aren 't twinkly points of light .
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it . and we can see places where stars are forming , like the eagle nebula . we see stars dying .
in six billion years , the sun will look like that .
and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion , leaving remnants like that .
on a still bigger scale , we see entire galaxies of stars .
we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled .
and to the cosmologist , these galaxies are just the atoms , as it were , of the large-scale universe .
this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky .
through a small telescope , this would look quite blank ,
but you see here hundreds of little , faint smudges .
each is a galaxy , fully like ours or andromeda , which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us .
the stars in those galaxies probably don 't have planets around them .
there 's scant chance of life there -- that 's because there 's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron , the building blocks of planets and of life .
we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang -- a hot , dense state . so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos ?
i 'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time , which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out .
but you see , as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom , you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small , dense irregularities , and structures develop .
and we 'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe .
and we compare simulated universes like that -- i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky .
well , we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang , but we still don 't know what banged and why it banged .
that 's a challenge for 21st-century science .
if my research group had a logo , it would be this picture here : an ouroboros , where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets , stars and galaxies .
we know our universes are united though -- links between left and right .
the everyday world is determined by atoms , how they stick together to make molecules .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
and , as we 've learned in the last few years , galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter : particles in huge swarms , far smaller even than atomic nuclei .
but we 'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top .
the micro-world of the quantum is understood .
on the right hand side , gravity holds sway . einstein explained that .
but the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory -- symbolized , as it were , gastronomically at the top of that picture .
and until we have that synthesis , we won 't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom , quantum effects could shake everything .
and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small , which we don 't yet have .
one idea , incidentally -- and i had this hazard sign to say i 'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our big bang was not the only one .
one idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space , just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper .
you can imagine ants on one of them thinking it 's a two-dimensional universe , not being aware of another population of ants on the other .
so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours , but we 're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension , and we 're imprisoned in our three .
and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we 've normally called our universe -- the aftermath of our big bang . and here 's another picture .
bottom right depicts our universe , which on the horizon is not beyond that , but even that is just one bubble , as it were , in some vaster reality .
many people suspect that just as we 've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems , one galaxy to many galaxies , we have to go to many big bangs from one big bang ,
perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties .
well , let 's go back to this picture .
there 's one challenge symbolized at the top , but there 's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom .
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small , but we want to understand the very complex .
and the most complex things are ourselves , midway between atoms and stars .
we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of .
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .
we clearly have to be large , compared to atoms , to have layer upon layer of complex structure .
we clearly have to be small , compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we 'd be crushed by gravity . and in fact , we are midway .
it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us .
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
well , most of you anyway .
the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all , greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right .
and it 's this science , which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world , but also transforming our world faster than ever .
and more than that , it 's engendering new kinds of change .
and i now move on to the second part of my talk , and the book " our final century " was mentioned .
if i was not a self-effacing brit , i would mention the book myself , and i would add that it 's available in paperback .
and in america it was called " our final hour " because americans like instant gratification .
but my theme is that in this century , not only has science changed the world faster than ever , but in new and different ways .
targeted drugs , genetic modification , artificial intelligence , perhaps even implants into our brains , may change human beings themselves . and human beings , their physique and character , has not changed for thousands of years .
it may change this century .
it 's new in our history .
and the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming , mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented , too .
and so , this makes this coming century a challenge .
bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects , while , nonetheless , reducing pressure on energy and resources .
but they will have a dark side .
in our interconnected world , novel technology could empower just one fanatic , or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses , to trigger some kind on disaster .
indeed , catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure -- error rather than terror .
and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence .
in fact , some years ago , bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over , etc .
i don 't go along with all that , but it 's interesting that he had a simple solution .
it was what he called " fine-grained relinquishment . "
he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits . now , that 's absurdly naive for two reasons .
first , any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science .
we have to accept that there will be hazards .
and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post-war era , post-world war ii , when the nuclear scientists who 'd been involved in making the atomic bomb , in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers .
and they were inspired not by the young einstein , who did the great work in relativity , but by the old einstein , the icon of poster and t-shirt , who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws .
he was premature . but he was a moral compass -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control .
and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i 'm privileged to know , joe rothblatt .
equally untidy office there , as you can see .
he 's 96 years old , and he founded the pugwash movement .
he persuaded einstein , as his last act , to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell .
and he sets an example of the concerned scientist .
and i think to harness science optimally , to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed , we need latter-day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt .
we need not just campaigning physicists , but we need biologists , computer experts and environmentalists as well .
and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service , or company employees subject to commercial pressure .
i wrote my book , " our final century , " as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there 's one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that 's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .
the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the american bible belt , anyway -- but most people , even those who are familiar with evolution , aren 't mindful that even more time lies ahead .
the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years , but it 'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out .
on that schematic picture , a sort of time-lapse picture , we 're halfway .
and it 'll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on earth is vaporized .
there 's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun 's demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go , here on earth and probably far beyond .
so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our earth and beyond .
if you represent the earth 's lifetime by a single year , say from january when it was made to december , the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in june -- a tiny fraction of the year .
but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective , our century is very , very special ,
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .
as i should have shown this earlier , it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun ; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria .
when einstein died in 1955 , one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post .
the plaque reads , " albert einstein lived here . "
and i 'd like to end with a vignette , as it were , inspired by this image .
we 've been familiar for 40 years with this image : the fragile beauty of land , ocean and clouds , contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints .
but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar , not just for 40 years , but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our earth .
what would they have seen ?
over nearly all that immense time , earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually .
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions .
apart from those brief traumas , nothing happens suddenly .
the continental landmasses drifted around .
ice cover waxed and waned .
successions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history , the last one-millionth part , a few thousand years , the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before .
this signaled the start of agriculture .
change has accelerated as human populations rose .
then other things happened even more abruptly .
within just 50 years -- that 's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise , and ominously fast .
the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all tv and cell phones and radar transmissions . and something else happened .
metallic objects -- albeit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the earth .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth 's final doom in another six billion years .
but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the earth 's life ?
these human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed ?
if they continued their vigil , what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years ?
will some spasm foreclose earth 's future ?
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization , but for civilization to survive , we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein -- humane , global and farseeing .
and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth , far beyond the earth as depicted here .
thank you very much .

savage-rumbaugh 's work with bonobo apes , which can understand spoken language and learn tasks by watching , forces the audience to rethink how much of what a species can do is determined by biology -- and how much by cultural exposure .

susan savage-rumbaugh : the real-life culture of bonobos
i work with a species called " bonobo . "
and i 'm happy most of the time , because i think this is the happiest species on the planet .
it 's kind of a well-kept secret .
this species lives only in the congo .
and they 're not in too many zoos , because of their sexual behavior .
their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with .
but --
actually , we have a lot to learn from them , because they 're a very egalitarian society and they 're a very empathetic society .
and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside .
it permeates their entire life .
and it 's used for communication .
and it 's used for conflict resolution .
and i think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of , divided our lives up into lots of parts .
we divided our world up with lots of categories .
and so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit .
but i don 't think that we were that way initially .
there are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there 's something very , very special about man .
maybe it 's his ability to have causal thought .
maybe it 's something special in his brain that allows him to have language .
maybe it 's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics .
well , i don 't know . there were tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire .
they had no stone tools .
to our knowledge they had no music .
so when you compare them to the bonobo , the bonobo is a little hairier .
he doesn 't stand quite as upright .
but there are a lot of similarities .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
and i don 't really think it 's in our biology ; i think we 've attributed it to our biology , but i don 't really think it 's there .
so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo .
this is kanzi .
he 's a bonobo .
right now , he 's in a forest in georgia .
his mother originally came from a forest in africa .
and she came to us when she was just at puberty , about six or seven years of age .
now this shows a bonobo on your right , and a chimpanzee on your left .
clearly , the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking .
the bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy .
as you can see , there 's not a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked .
as they turn toward us you 'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn 't have to rotate quite so much from side to side .
so the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier .
and now we see all four .
video : narrator : the wild bonobo lives in central africa , in the jungle encircled by the congo river .
canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo , almost three decades ago .
bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee .
slim-bodied , bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk bidpedally .
what 's more , they are able to walk upright for long distances .
susan savage-rumbaugh : let 's go say hello to austin first and then go to the a frame .
ss : this is kanzi and i , in the forest .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
none of them are tricks .
they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously , by nhk of japan .
we have eight bonobos .
video : look at all this stuff that 's here for our campfire .
ss : an entire family at our research centre .
video : you going to help get some sticks ?
good .
we need more sticks , too .
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
that 's a wasps ' nest .
you can get it out .
i hope i have a lighter .
you can use the lighter to start the fire .
ss : so kanzi is very interested in fire .
he doesn 't do it yet without a lighter , but i think if he saw someone do it , he might be able to do --
make a fire without a lighter .
he 's learning about how to keep a fire going .
he 's learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
this is a smile on the face of a bonobo .
these are happy vocalizations .
video : you 're happy .
you 're very happy about this part .
you 've got to put some water on the fire . you see the water ?
good job .
ss : forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack .
but he likes to carry things from place to place .
video : austin , i hear you saying " austin . "
ss : he talks to other bonobos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
this is his sister .
this is her first time to try to drive a golf cart .
video : goodbye .
ss : she 's got the pedals down , but not the wheel .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
like us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
video : narrator : by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human , and documenting their development across two decades , scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution .
his name is nyota .
it means " star " in swahili .
panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
in the wild , the parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring .
here panbanisha uses scissors , instead of her hands , to groom nyota .
very impressive .
subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself .
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
he can now cut through tough animal hide .
ss : kanzi 's learned to make stone tools .
video : kanzi now makes his tools , just as our ancestors may have made them , two-and-a-half million years ago --
by holding the rocks in both hands , to strike one against the other .
he has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows , he can make much larger , sharper flakes .
kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough .
the tough hide is difficult to cut , even with a knife .
the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
kanzi 's rock is from gona , ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
the flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
compare them to the tools our ancestors used ; they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's .
panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods .
she keeps staring out the window .
ss : this is -- let me show you something we didn 't think they would do .
video : for several days now , panbanisha has not been outside .
ss : i normally talk about language .
video : then panbanisha does something unexpected .
ss : but since i 'm advised not to do what i normally do , i haven 't told you that these apes have language .
it 's a geometric language .
video : she takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor .
what is she writing ?
ss : she 's also saying the name of that , with her voice .
video : now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
ss : these are her symbols on her keyboard .
they speak when she touches them .
video : panbanisha is communicating to dr. sue where she wants to go .
" a frame " represents a hut in the woods .
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .
ss : very nice . beautiful , panbanisha .
ss : at first we didn 't really realize what she was doing , until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it .
video : this lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
the curved line is very similar to the lexigram .
the next symbol panbanisha writes represents " collar . "
it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out .
ss : that 's an institutional requirement .
video : this symbol is not as clear as the others , but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines .
researchers began to record what panbanisha said , by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .
panbanisha watched .
soon she began to write as well .
the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
how did they develop ?
ss : we found that the most important thing for permitting bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them .
it 's simply to use language around them , because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others , that are important to you , are saying to you .
once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
so we want to create an environment in which bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --
we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
narrator : this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha .
panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica , until nyota , now one year old , steals it .
then he peers eagerly into his mother 's mouth .
is he looking for where the sound came from ?
dr. sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano .
she wasn 't forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
researcher : go ahead . go ahead . i 'm listening .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
narrator : kanzi plays the xylophone ; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies dr. sue 's singing .
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
researcher : ok , now get the monsters . get them .
take the cherries too .
now watch out , stay away from them now .
now you can chase them again . time to chase them .
now you have to stay away . get away .
run away . run .
now we can chase them again . go get them .
oh no !
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
narrator : none of us , bonobo or human , can possibly even imagine ?
ss : so we have a bi-species environment , we call it a " panhomoculture . "
we 're learning how to become like them .
we 're learning how to communicate with them , in really high-pitched tones .
we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild .
and they 're learning to become like us .
because we believe that it 's not biology ; it 's culture .
so we 're sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / tim _ berners _ lee _ the _ year _ open _ data _ went _ worldwide.html
at ted2009 , tim berners-lee called for " raw data now " -- for governments , scientists and institutions to make their data openly available on the web . at ted university in 2010 , he shows a few of the interesting results when the data gets linked up .
internet , computers , statistics , visualizations , web
788
tim berners-lee : the year open data went worldwide
last year here at ted i asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined .
so , today i 'm back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement afoot , now , around the world .
the cry of " raw data now ! " which i made people make in the auditorium , was heard around the world .
so , let 's roll the video .
a classic story , the first one which lots of people picked up , was when in march -- on march 10th in fact , soon after ted -- paul clarke , in the u.k. government , blogged , " oh , i 've just got some raw data . here it is , it 's about bicycle accidents . "
two days it took the times online to make a map , a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected .
here 's more data , traffic survey data , again , put out by the u.k. government , and because they put it up using the linked data standards , then a user could just make a map , just by clicking .
does this data affect things ? well , let 's get back to 2008 .
look at zanesville , ohio .
here 's a map a lawyer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
and he got , from other data sources , information to show which houses are occupied by white people .
well , there was too much of a correlation , he felt , between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water , and the judge was not impressed either .
the judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars .
that 's the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
let 's look at some data from the u.k. now .
this is u.k. government data , a completely independent site , where does my money go . it allows anybody to go there and burrow down .
you can burrow down by a particular type of spending , or you can go through all the different regions and compare them .
so , that 's happening in the u.k. with u.k. government data .
yes , certainly you can do it over here .
here 's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .
take an arbitrary example , long beach , california , you can go and have a look at what recovery money they 've been spending on different things such as energy .
in fact , this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov , and data.gov.uk .
and i 'm delighted to see a great competition between the u.k. in blue , and the u.s. in red .
how can you use this stuff ?
well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses , you can make paper , print off a paper which has got very , very specific things about the bus stops , the things specifically near you .
on a larger scale , this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the afghan elections .
it allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at .
the red circles are polling stations , selected by your criteria .
and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors , like the threat level .
so , that was government data .
i also talked about community-generated data -- in fact i edited some . this is the wiki map , this is the open street map . " terrace theater " i actually put on the map because it wasn 't on the map before ted last year .
i was not the only person editing the open street map . each flash on this visualization -- put together by ito world -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the open street map .
let 's now spin the world during the same year .
every flash is an edit . somebody somewhere looking at the open street map , and realizing it could be better .
you can see europe is ablaze with updates .
some places , perhaps not as much as they should be .
here focusing in on haiti .
the map of port au-prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be , not as good as the map of california .
fortunately , just after the earthquake , geoeye , a commercial company , released satellite imagery with a license , which allowed the open-source community to use it .
this is january , in time lapse , of people editing ... that 's the earthquake .
after the earthquake , immediately , people all over the world , mappers who wanted to help , and could , looked at that imagery , built the map , quickly building it up .
we 're focusing now on port-au-prince .
the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [ satellite images ] .
so , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you 're doing relief work in port-au-prince .
witness the fact that it 's here on this garmin device being used by rescue team in haiti .
there 's the map showing , on the left-hand side , that hospital -- actually that 's a hospital ship .
this is a real-time map that shows blocked roads , damaged buildings , refugee camps --
it shows things that are needed [ for rescue and relief work ] .
so , if you 've been involved in that at all , i just wanted to say : whatever you 've been doing , whether you 've just been chanting , " raw data now ! " or you 've been putting government or scientific data online , i just wanted to take this opportunity to say : thank you very much , and we have only just started !

filmmaker david hoffman shares footage from his feature-length documentary sputnik mania , which shows how the soviet union 's launch of sputnik in 1957 led to both the space race and the arms race -- and jump-started science and math education around the world .

david hoffman shares his sputnik mania
fifty years ago in the old soviet union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
with it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
the rocket was huge .
and packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
on october 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
one of the russian scientists wrote at the time : " we are about to create a new planet that we will call sputnik .
in the olden days , explorers like vasco da gama and columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
now we have the good fortune to open up space .
and it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . "
you 're watching snippets from " sputnik , " my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
it tells the story of sputnik , and the story of what happened to america as a result .
for days after the launch , sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
but just three days later , on a day they called red monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile .
all hell broke loose .
sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit america -- historians say the equal of pearl harbor or 9 / 11 .
it provoked the missile gap .
it exploded an arms race .
it began the space race .
within a year , congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
for example , some here will remember this day , june 1958 , the national civil defense drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
or the gallup poll that showed that seven in 10 americans
believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
for example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik .
support for engineering , math and science -- education in general -- boomed .
and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa , and the internet , and , of course , nasa .
my feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
but it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for america .
" sputnik " will soon be released .
in closing , i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime tedster , jay walker .
and i 'd like to thank you all .
. thank you , chris .

steven strogatz on sync
i was trying to think , how is sync connected to happiness , and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing .
we like to dance together , we like singing together .
and so , if you 'll put up with this , i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today . the experiment is -- and i notice , by the way , that when you applauded , that you did it in a typical north american way , that is , you were raucous and incoherent .
you were not organized . it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison .
do you think you could do it ? i would like to see if this audience would -- no , you haven 't practiced , as far as i know -- can you get it together to clap in sync ?
whoa ! now , that 's what we call emergent behavior .
so i didn 't expect that , but -- i mean , i expected you could synchronize .
it didn 't occur to me you 'd increase your frequency .
it 's interesting .
so what do we make of that ? first of all , we know that you 're all brilliant .
this is a room full of intelligent people , highly sensitive .
some trained musicians out there .
is that what enabled you to synchronize ?
so to put the question a little more seriously , let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did , for spontaneous synchronization .
do you need , for instance , to be as smart as you are ?
do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize ?
do you need to be alive ? i mean , that 's a spooky thought , right ?
inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves .
it 's real . in fact , i 'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of , if not one of the most , perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
it 's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy .
i mean , i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it 's not .
but there is a countervailing force in the universe -- the tendency towards spontaneous order . and so that 's our theme .
now , to get into that , let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we 're talking about synchrony in nature , which is the glorious example of birds that flock together , or fish swimming in organized schools .
so these are not particularly intelligent creatures , and yet , as we 'll see , they exhibit beautiful ballets .
this is from a bbc show called " predators , " and what we 're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense .
when you 're small and vulnerable , like these starlings , or like the fish , it helps to swarm to avoid predators , to confuse predators .
let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous .
for a long time , biologists were puzzled by this behavior , wondering how it could be possible .
we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony .
these creatures are not choreographed .
they 're choreographing themselves .
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works .
i 'll show you a computer model made by iain couzin , a researcher at oxford , that shows how swarms work .
there are just three simple rules .
first , all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors .
second , all the individuals have a tendency to line up .
and third , they 're all attracted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart .
and when you build those three rules in , automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks .
now , fish like to stay close together , about a body length apart .
birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart .
but except for that difference , the rules are the same for both .
now , all this changes when a predator enters the scene .
there 's a fourth rule : when a predator 's coming , get out of the way .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
the prey move out in random directions , and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again , so there 's this constant splitting and reforming .
and you see that in nature .
keep in mind that , although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate , what 's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior .
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .
that is , out of the desire to save itself , each creature is following these rules , and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them .
even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group , they 're not .
you might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm , so you can think of several .
as i say , if you 're in a swarm , your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .
there are many eyes to spot danger .
and you 'll see in the example with the starlings , with the birds , when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them , that actually waves of panic can propagate , sending messages over great distances .
you 'll see -- let 's see , it 's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not .
information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism .
yes , it 's happening here .
see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm .
it 's beautiful . the birds are , we sort of understand , we think , from that computer model , what 's going on .
as i say , it 's just those three simple rules , plus the one about watch out for predators .
there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this .
we don 't , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
i 'm a mathematician . we would like to be able to understand better .
i mean , i showed you a computer model , but a computer is not understanding .
a computer is , in a way , just another experiment .
we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand , you know , exactly where this organization comes from .
how do the rules give rise to the patterns ?
there is one case that we have begun to understand better , and it 's the case of fireflies .
if you see fireflies in north america , like so many north american sorts of things , they tend to be independent operators . they ignore each other .
they each do their own thing , flashing on and off , paying no attention to their neighbors .
but in southeast asia -- places like thailand or malaysia or borneo -- there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies .
you can see it every night along the river banks .
the trees , mangrove trees , are filled with fireflies communicating with light .
specifically , it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together , in perfect synchrony , to reinforce a message to the females .
and the message , as you can imagine , is " come hither . mate with me . "
in a second i 'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense . this is a single frame .
then on , and then off -- a 30th of a second , there .
and then watch this whole river bank , and watch how precise the synchrony is .
on , more on and then off .
the combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles -- is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers . it 's stunning .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travelers , like sir francis drake , went to thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle .
no one believed them .
we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west .
and for a long time , even after it was documented , it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion .
scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it , or , you know , a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are none .
but i hope you 've convinced yourself now , with this nighttime video , that they really were very well synchronized .
okay , well , the issue then is , do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order , and i 've already hinted that the answer is no .
well , you don 't have to be a whole creature .
you can even be just a single cell .
like , take , for instance , your pacemaker cells in your heart right now .
they 're keeping you alive .
every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region , the sinoatrial node , which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep , have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down -- to send a signal to the ventricles to pump .
now , your pacemaker is not a single cell .
it 's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly .
i don 't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea .
if you have epilepsy , there is an instance of billions of brain cells , or at least millions , discharging in pathological concert .
so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing .
you don 't have to be alive . you don 't have to be even a single cell .
if you look , for instance , at how lasers work , that would be a case of atomic synchrony .
in a laser , what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent -- many different colors and different frequencies , sort of like the way you clapped initially -- but if you were a laser , it would be rhythmic applause . it would be all atoms pulsating in unison , emitting light of one color , one frequency .
now comes the very risky part of my talk , which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize .
hold your breath for me .
what i have here are two empty water bottles .
this is not keith barry doing a magic trick .
this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles .
i have some metronomes here .
can you hear that ?
all right , so , i 've got a metronome , and it 's the world 's smallest metronome , the -- well , i shouldn 't advertise .
anyway , so this is the world 's smallest metronome .
i 've set it on the fastest setting , and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting .
we can try this first . if i just put them on the table together , there 's no reason for them to synchronize , and they probably won 't .
maybe you 'd better listen to them . i 'll stand here .
what i 'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren 't perfectly the same .
right ? they did .
they were in sync for a while , but then they drifted apart .
and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate .
now , you might think that 's a bizarre idea .
how can metronomes communicate ?
well , they can communicate through mechanical forces .
so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that .
i also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
i 'm going to put them on a movable platform , which is the " guide to graduate study at cornell . " okay ? so here it is .
let 's see if we can get this to work .
my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over .
all right . so there we go . let 's see . ok , i 'm not trying to cheat -- let me start them out of sync . no , hard to even do that .
all right . so before any one goes out of sync , i 'll just put those right there .
now , that might seem a bit whimsical , but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order sometimes has unexpected consequences .
and a clear case of that , was something that happened in london in the year 2000 .
the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london -- a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames , first river crossing in over 100 years in london .
there was a big competition for the design of this bridge , and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team -- in the ted spirit , actually -- of an architect -- perhaps the greatest architect in the united kingdom , lord norman foster -- working with an artist , a sculptor , sir anthony caro , and an engineering firm , ove arup .
and together they submitted a design based on lord foster 's vision , which was -- he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books , and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss , he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber .
he would shoot his light saber across the abyss , making a blade of light , and then scamper across on this blade of light .
he said , " that 's the vision i want to give to london .
i want a blade of light across the thames . "
so they built the blade of light , and it 's a very thin ribbon of steel , the world 's -- probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is , with cables that are out on the side .
you 're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top .
these cables were on the side of the bridge , like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the thames -- that 's what 's holding up this bridge .
now , everyone was very excited to try it out .
on opening day , thousands of londoners came out , and something happened .
and within two days the bridge was closed to the public .
so i want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day , who will describe what happened .
man : it really started moving sideways and slightly up and down , rather like being on the boat .
woman : yeah , it felt unstable , and it was very windy , and i remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides , so you could definitely -- there was something going on sideways , it felt , maybe .
interviewer : not up and down ? boy : no .
interviewer : and not forwards and backwards ? boy : no .
interviewer : just sideways . about how much was it moving , do you think ?
boy : it was about -- interviewer : i mean , that much , or this much ?
boy : about the second one .
interviewer : this much ? boy : yeah .
man : it was at least six , six to eight inches , i would have thought .
interviewer : right , so , at least this much ? man : oh , yes .
woman : i remember wanting to get off .
interviewer : oh , did you ? woman : yeah . it felt odd .
interviewer : so it was enough to be scary ? woman : yeah , but i thought that was just me .
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
boy : we had to do this because , to keep in balance because if you didn 't keep your balance , then you would just fall over about , like , to the left or right , about 45 degrees .
interviewer : so just show me how you walk normally . right .
and then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go . right .
so you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and -- oh , and short steps ?
man : that 's right . and it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it .
interviewer : were they deliberately walking in step , or anything like that ?
man : no , they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge .
steven strogatz : all right , so that already gives you a hint of what happened .
think of the bridge as being like this platform .
think of the people as being like metronomes .
now , you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome , but after all , we do walk like -- i mean , we oscillate back and forth as we walk .
and especially if we start to walk like those people did , right ?
they all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move .
and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge .
but also , after you see the bridge on opening day , you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie , who figured out what happened on the bridge , and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was .
it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move , that engineers knew nothing about .
actually , i think the first person you 'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project . okay .
interviewer : did anyone get hurt ? engineer : no .
interviewer : right . so it was quite small -- engineer : yes . interviewer : -- but real ?
engineer : absolutely . interviewer : you thought , " oh , bother . "
engineer : i felt i was disappointed about it .
we 'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge , and we 'd analyzed it , we 'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes -- and here it was doing something that we didn 't know about .
interviewer : you didn 't expect . engineer : exactly .
narrator : the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison , not only with each other , but with the bridge .
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .
but how could the crowd become synchronized ?
was there something special about the millennium bridge that caused this effect ?
this was to be the focus of the investigation .
interviewer : well , at last the simulated bridge is finished , and i can make it wobble .
now , allan , this is all your fault , isn 't it ? allan mcrobie : yes .
interviewer : you designed this , yes , this simulated bridge , and this , you reckon , mimics the action of the real bridge ?
am : it captures a lot of the physics , yes .
interviewer : right . so if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ?
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me , suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .
am : this one 's only a couple of tons , so it 's fairly easy to get going .
just by walking . interviewer : well , it 's certainly going now .
am : it doesn 't have to be a real dangle . just walk . it starts to go .
interviewer : it 's actually quite difficult to walk .
you have to be careful where you put your feet down , don 't you , because if you get it wrong , it just throws you off your feet .
am : it certainly affects the way you walk , yes . you can 't walk normally on it .
interviewer : no . if you try and put one foot in front of another , it 's moving your feet away from under you . am : yes .
interviewer : so you 've got to put your feet out sideways .
so already , the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge .
am : ... ice-skating gait . there isn 't all this sort of snake way of walking .
interviewer : for a more convincing experiment , i wanted my own opening-day crowd , the sound check team .
their instructions : just walk normally .
it 's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it .
they 're all having some difficulty walking .
and the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step .
but then , of course , everyone is driving the bridge .
you can 't help it . you 're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step , and therefore to drive it to move further .
ss : all right , well , with that from the ministry of silly walks , maybe i 'd better end . i see i 've gone over .
but i hope that you 'll go outside and see the world in a new way , to see all the amazing synchrony around us . thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / cary _ fowler _ one _ seed _ at _ a _ time _ protecting _ the _ future _ of _ food.html
the varieties of wheat , corn and rice we grow today may not thrive in a future threatened by climate change . cary fowler takes us inside a vast global seed bank , buried within a frozen mountain in norway , that stores a diverse group of food-crop for whatever tomorrow may bring .

cary fowler : one seed at a time , protecting the future of food
i 've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named jack harlan .
and he described the diversity within crops -- all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such -- as a genetic resource .
and he said , " this genetic resource , " -- and i 'll never forget the words -- " stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine . " i figured he was either really on to something , or he was one of these academic nutcases .
so , i looked a little further , and what i figured out was that he wasn 't a nutcase .
he was the most respected scientist in the field .
what he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture .
it 's the raw material , the stuff , of evolution in our agricultural crops .
not a trivial matter .
and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling , literally crumbling .
that indeed , a mass extinction was underway in our fields , in our agricultural system .
and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring .
now , i know that many of you don 't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and , let 's face it , that 's logical .
you don 't see it in the newspaper every day .
and when you go into the supermarket , you certainly don 't see a lot of choices there .
you see apples that are red , yellow , and green and that 's about it .
so , let me show you a picture of one form of diversity .
here 's some beans ,
and there are about 35 or 40 different varieties of beans on this picture .
now , imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane .
if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world , and i put 30 or 40 of them on a slide , it would take about 10 slides because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world .
but there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world , and i had a slide like this , and i switched it every second , it would take up my entire ted talk , and i wouldn 't have to say anything .
but the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is -- that this diversity is being lost .
we have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat , and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice , but it 's being lost .
and i want to give you an example of that .
it 's a bit of a personal example , in fact .
in the united states , in the 1800s -- that 's where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples .
imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
today , 6,800 of those are extinct ,
no longer to be seen again .
i used to have a list of these extinct apples ,
and when i would go out and give a presentation , i would pass the list out in the audience . i wouldn 't tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order ,
and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother 's maiden name .
and at the end of the speech , i would ask , " how many people have found a name ? " and i never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand .
and i said , " you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them . they gave them their name .
the bad news is they 're extinct .
the good news is a third of you didn 't hold up your hand . your apple 's still out there .
find it . make sure it doesn 't join the list . "
so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there .
and there 's an old book back here , and i want to read a piece from it .
this book was published in 1904 .
it 's called " the apples of new york " and this is the second volume .
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
and the fowler apple is described in here -- i hope this doesn 't surprise you -- as , " a beautiful fruit . "
i don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
but , to be honest , the description goes on and it says that it " doesn 't rank high in quality , however . "
and then he has to go even further . it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine . " as grown in new york , the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is , on the whole , unsatisfactory . " and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here , and the lesson is : so why save it ? i get this question all the time . why don 't we just save the best one ?
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one .
today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change that the others don 't .
so it 's not necessary , thank god , that the fowler apple is the best apple in the world .
it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good , unique trait .
and for that reason , we ought to be saving it .
why ? as a raw material , as a trait we can use in the future .
think of diversity as giving us options .
and options , of course , are exactly what we need in an era of climate change .
i want to show you two slides , but first , i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at stanford and university of washington -- to ask the question : what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change
and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this ? in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past .
the coldest growing seasons of the future , hotter than the hottest of the past .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
i don 't know . can fish play the piano ?
if agriculture hasn 't experienced that , how could it be adapted ?
now , the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world , and the place where climate change , ironically , is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub-saharan africa .
so i 've picked two examples here , and i want to show you .
in the histogram before you now , the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures , going back about far as we have temperature data .
and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another .
some are colder , some are hotter and it 's a bell shaped curve .
the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons .
in the future , later this century , it 's going to look like the red , totally out of bounds .
the agricultural system and , more importantly , the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before .
here 's south africa . the same story .
but the most interesting thing about south africa is we don 't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble .
by 2030 , if the maize , or corn , varieties , which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field -- in 2030 , we 'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population , that 's a food crisis . it 's global in nature .
we will watch children starve to death on tv .
now , you may say that 20 years is a long way off .
it 's two breeding cycles for maize .
we have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
we have to get climate-ready crops in the field , and we have to do that rather quickly .
now , the good news is that we have conserved . we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity , agricultural diversity , mostly in the form of seed , and we put it in seed banks , which is a fancy way of saying a freezer .
if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers , you dry it and then you freeze it .
unfortunately , these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable .
disasters have happened . in recent years we lost the gene bank , the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan . you can guess why .
in rwanda , in the solomon islands .
and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings , financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures , and all kinds of things , and every time something like this happens , it means extinction . we lose diversity .
and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys .
i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
so , a number of us got together and decided that , you know , enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity .
you don 't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear , but it 's very important diversity .
so we needed a really safe place , and we went quite far north to find it .
to svalbard , in fact . this is above mainland norway . you can see greenland there .
that 's at 78 degrees north .
it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape . i can 't even begin to describe it to you .
it 's otherworldly , beautiful .
we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen , the norwegian genetic resources program , to design this facility .
what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility , which is built in a mountain in svalbard .
the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold , so we get natural freezing temperatures .
but it 's remote . it 's remote and accessible
so it 's safe and we don 't depend on mechanical refrigeration .
this is more than just an artist 's dream , it 's now a reality .
and this next picture shows it in context , in svalbard .
and here 's the front door of this facility .
when you open up the front door , this is what you 're looking at . it 's pretty simple . it 's a hole in the ground . it 's a tunnel , and you go into the tunnel , chiseled in solid rock , about 130 meters .
there are now a couple of security doors , so you won 't see it quite like this .
again , when you get to the back , you get into an area that 's really my favorite place .
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd , but ...
some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
in this place there .
if you were to walk into one of these rooms , you would see this .
it 's not very exciting , but if you know what 's there , it 's pretty emotional .
we have now about 425,000 samples of unique crop varieties .
there 's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now .
about a year from now , we 'll have over half a million samples .
we 're going up to over a million , and someday we 'll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility .
this is a backup system for world agriculture . it 's a backup system for all the seed banks . storage is free .
it operates like a safety deposit box .
norway owns the mountain and the facility , but the depositors own the seed .
and if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states , of canada , and an international institution from syria .
i think it 's interesting in that this facility , i think , is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries , literally , every country in the world -- because we have seeds from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that 's both long term , sustainable and positive .
i can 't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way .
i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change , for the water crisis .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things , or the energy crisis , or world hunger , or peace in conflict .
i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that , but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can 't solve any of those problems if we don 't have crop diversity .
because i challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity .
because , quite literally , if agriculture doesn 't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
and if crops don 't adapt to climate change , neither will agriculture , neither will we .
so , this is not something pretty and nice to do .
there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it .
it is , i agree , a nice thing to do .
but it 's a necessary thing to do .
so , in a very real sense , i believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task .
the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us , but it 's not the complete answer .
we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there .
we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future .
we need to catalog it . it 's a library of life ,
but right now i would say we don 't have a card catalog for it .
and we need to support it financially .
my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university , we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat .
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever .
so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
and my final thought is that we , of course , by conserving wheat , rice , potatoes , and the other crops , we may , quite simply , end up saving ourselves .
thank you .

yossi vardi fights local warming
we are going to talk today about the sequel of " inconvenient truth . "
it 's time again to talk about " inconvenient truth , " a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
somebody has to take the lead , and i decided to do it .
if you are scared by global warming , wait until we learn about local warming .
we will talk today about local warming .
important health message : blogging may be hazardous to your health , especially if you are a male .
this message is given as a public service .
blogging affects your posture . we start with the posture .
this is the posture of ladies who are not blogging ; this is the posture of ladies who are blogging .
this is the natural posture of a man sitting , squatting for ventilation purposes .
and this is the natural posture of a standing man ,
and i think this picture inspired chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session .
this is male blogging posture sitting , and the result is , " for greater comfort , men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women ,
when working on laptop . however , they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps ,
which resulted in a significant rise of body heat between their thighs . " this is the issue of local warming .
this is a very serious newspaper ; it 's times of england --
very serious . this is a very --
-- gentlemen and ladies , be serious .
this is a very serious research , that you should read the underline .
and be careful , your genes are in danger .
will geeks become endangered species ?
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop --
i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
global warming fun .
how to take care in five easy steps :
first of all , you can use natural ventilation . you can use body breath .
you should stay cool with the appropriate clothing .
you should care about your posture -- this is not right .
can you extract from chris another minute and a half for me , because i have a video i have to show you .
you are great . this is the correct posture .
another benefit of wi-fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi-fi .
wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor . and there are some enhanced protection measures , which i would like to share with you ,
and i would like , in a minute , to thank philips for helping .
this is a research which was done in ' 86 , but it 's still valid .
scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature and is lowered by shaving .
by the way , i must admit , my english is not so good ,
i didn 't know what is scrotal ; i understand it 's a scrotum .
i guess in plural it 's scrotal , like medium and media .
digital scrotum , digital media .
and only last year i recognized that i 'm a proud scrotum owner .
and this research is being precipitated by the u.s. government ,
so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes .
video : man : the philips bodygroom has a sleek , ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim those scruffy underarm hairs , the untidy curls on and around your [ bleep ] , as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your
[ bleep ] and [ bleep ] . once you use the bodygroom , the world looks different . and so does your [ bleep ] . these days , with a hair-free back , well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [ bleep ] , well , let 's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy .
yossi vardi : this is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year , known as the optical inch by philips . let 's applaud philips --
-- for this gesture for humanity .
and this is how they are promoting the product . this is --
i didn 't touch it , this is original .
laptop use to solve overpopulation . and if everything failed , there are some secondary uses .
and then our next talk , our next ted if you invite me will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket .
and this is what the young generation says .
and i just want to show you that i 'm not just preaching ,
but i also practice .
4 am in the morning .
you cannot use this picture .
now , i have some mini ted prizes , this is the philips bodygroom , one for our leader .
anybody feels threatened , anybody really need it ?
any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .

burt rutan sees the future of space
i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem .
we 're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we 've regressed .
we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done .
and that is , instinctively we 've gone out and climbed over difficult places , went to more hostile places ,
and found out later , maybe to our surprise , that that 's the reason we survived .
and i feel very strongly that it 's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs .
we need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
i 'm particularly troubled that what nasa 's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot , i screwed up .
we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics .
what we 're looking forward to is -- what we 're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children ,
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff .
we 're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later ? and we 're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new .
i 'm really troubled by that . but anyway that 's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
that 's the theme of my next 15 minutes here .
and i think that the inspiration begins when you 're very young : three-year-olds , up to 12- , 14-year-olds .
what they look at is the most important thing .
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
and there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened .
it started in 1908 , when the wright brothers flew in paris , and everybody said , " ooh , hey , i can do that . " there 's only a few people that have flown in early 1908 . in four years , 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes , thousand of pilots . airplanes were invented by natural selection .
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
there were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , don 't try that again .
the ones that flew and landed ok because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four-year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . and that 's why they 're so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what 's good .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
there 's only been two concepts tried -- two by the u.s. and one by the russians .
well , who was inspired during that time period ?
aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .
the jet age started : the missile age started . von braun was on there showing how to go to mars -- and this was before sputnik .
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there 'd be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?
but , you know , nasa screwed that up because they 've sent these robots and they 've landed it only in the deserts .
if you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew , and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport .
you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid -- and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren 't having the courage to try .
well , what did i do when i was a kid ?
i didn 't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
and , well , we didn 't have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight-testing airplanes for the air force . and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
and some 3,000 of those are flying . of course , one of them is around the world voyager . i founded another company in ' 82 , which is my company now .
and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
and there 's a lot of them that i actually can 't show you on this chart .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly , taken out of service .
we retreated in ' 98 back to something that was developed in ' 56 . what ?
the most impressive spaceship ever , i believe , was a grumman lunar lander . it was a -- you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , didn 't need any maintenance guys -- that 's kind of cool .
we 've lost that capability . we abandoned it in ' 72 .
this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in 1961 .
three years , and we can 't do that now . crazy .
talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they 're replaced by something else .
these things tend to happen every 25 years . 40 years long , with an overlap . you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies . the interesting thing --
by the way , the speed here , excuse me , higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles . there is none here .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 .
here 's the biggie , and that is , you don 't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
you know , a good example , of course , is the darpa net .
computers were used for artillery first , then irs .
but when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . private sector has to do it .
keep that in mind . i put down innovation --
i 've looked for innovation cycles in space ; i found none .
the very first year , starting when gagarin went in space , and a few weeks later alan shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year .
in 2003 , everyone that the united states sent to space was killed .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
in 2004 , there were only two flights : two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station . and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
there is no growth . there 's no activity . there 's no nothing .
this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone .
this is a picture here taken from orbit .
our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that .
we know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now , do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done .
and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
well , first of all , what 's going to happen next ?
the first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
there 's another one announced just last week .
and it will be sub-orbital . and the reason it has to be sub-orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
that 's -- you don 't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
it 'll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
i can 't tell you when this will start , because i don 't want my competition to know my schedule .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions ,
and very quickly , you 'll see those resort hotels in orbit .
and that real easy thing to do , which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view . and that will be really cool .
because the moon doesn 't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want .
oh , it 's going to be so much fun .
ok . my critics say , " hey , rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires ' money for joyrides for billionaires .
what 's this ? this is not a transportation system ; it 's just for fun . "
and i used to be bothered by that , and then i got to thinking ,
well , wait a minute . i bought my first apple computer in 1978
and i bought it because i could say , " i got a computer at my house and you don 't .
'what do you use it for ? ' come over . it does frogger . " ok .
not the bank 's computer or lockheed 's computer , but the home computer was for games .
for a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn 't even know what it was for .
but what happened , the fact that we had this big industry , big development , big improvement and capability and so on , and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention .
and the inventor is in this audience .
al gore invented the internet and because of that , something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun , became everything -- our commerce , our research , our communication and , if we let the google guys think for another couple weekends , we can add a dozen more things to the list .
and it won 't be very long before you won 't be able to convince kids that we didn 't always have computers in our homes .
so fun is defendable .
ok , i want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what 's going to happen .
and in it also brings up another point , right here .
there 's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don 't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
paul allen , elan musk , richard branson , jeff bezos , the ansari family , which is now funding the russians ' sub-orbital thing , bob bigelow , a private space station , and carmack .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it 's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they 're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct .
they were inspired by big progress . but look at the progress that 's going on after that .
there were a couple of examples here .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly ,
and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
it went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . and we 're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late ' 50s .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now .
and i 'm talking about if you 've got a baby now , or if you 've got a 10-year-old now .
what 's out there is there 's something really interesting going to happen here .
relatively soon , you 'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane . it 's never happened before .
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space , very soon -- wait a minute , what 's happening here , we 'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability , and i think very soon this .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
ok , i look forward to a new " capitalist 's space race , " let 's call it .
you remember the space race in the ' 60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
we didn 't lose them technically . the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly it --
you can argue that 's not a technical loss .
sputnik wasn 't a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
america -- the world saw america as not being the leader in technology , and that was a very strong thing .
and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin , not months or decades , or whatever . so we had the capability .
but america lost . we lost . and because of that , we made a big jump to recover it .
well , again , what 's interesting here is we 've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already .
you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america --
can 't do it . you can buy it in russia .
you can fly with russian hardware . this is available because a russian space program is starving ,
and it 's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .
it 's commercial . it can be defined as space tourism . they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon , like apollo 8 was done .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon .
but , you know , would you have thought back in the ' 60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware ?
and would you have thought , would the russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside won 't be russians ? maybe it 'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire ? well , that 's weird : you know , it really is .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
i think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we 're first or not really doesn 't matter .
the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde .
and then they flew a few cargo flights , and took it out of service .
i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
ok , we 'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
this little thing says here : five times what nasa 's doing by 2020 . i want to tell you , already there 's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already , worldwide . if you read -- if you google it , you 'll find about half of that money , but there 's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . hey , that 's pretty big .
i 'm predicting , though , as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost , or less -- this is going to be very profitable .
i predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u.s. taxpayer spends for nasa 's manned spacecraft work .
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 . and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no taxpayer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .
and that is because it 's us . it 's private industry .
you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --
and we 've done it for a long time . the naca , before nasa , never developed an airliner and never ran an airline .
but nasa is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , ok . and we 've shied away from it because we 're afraid of it . but starting back in june of 2004 , when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
ok , thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / william _ li.html
william li presents a new way to think about treating cancer and other diseases : anti-angiogenesis , preventing the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor . the crucial first step : eating cancer-fighting foods that cut off the supply lines and beat cancer at its own game .

william li : can we eat to starve cancer ?
good afternoon .
there 's a medical revolution happening all around us , and it 's one that 's going to help us conquer some of society 's most dreaded conditions , including cancer .
the revolution is called angiogenesis , and it 's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels .
so why should we care about blood vessels ?
well , the human body is literally packed with them : 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries ;
we 've got 19 billion of them in our bodies .
and these are the vessels of life , and , as i 'll show you , they can also be the vessels of death .
now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in .
for example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood ;
in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange ;
in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation ;
and in nerves they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive .
we get most of these blood vessels when we 're actually still in the womb ,
and what that means is that as adults , blood vessels don 't normally grow . except in a few special circumstances :
in women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus ;
during pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby .
and after injury , blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound .
and this is actually what it looks like ,
hundreds of blood vessels all growing toward the center of the wound .
so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time .
it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances , stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis , such that , when we need a brief burst of blood vessels , the body can do this by releasing stimulators , proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout . and when those excess vessels are no longer needed , the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels --
for example , after an injury --
and a body can do that too , but only to that normal level , that set point .
but what we now know is that for a number of diseases , there are defects in the system where the body can 't prune back extra blood vessels or can 't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time .
and in these situations , angiogenesis is out of balance . and when angiogenesis is out of balance , a myriad of diseases result .
for example , insufficient angiogenesis -- not enough blood vessels -- leads to wounds that don 't heal , heart attacks , legs without circulation , death from stroke , nerve damage .
and on the other end , excessive angiogenesis -- too many blood vessels -- drives disease ,
and we see this in cancer , blindness , arthritis , obesity , alzheimer 's disease .
in total , there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator .
and this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .
now i 'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer , every type of cancer .
so here we go .
this is a tumor : dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain .
and under the microscope , you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels , capillaries that are feeding cancer cells , bringing oxygen and nutrients .
but cancers don 't start out like this .
and , in fact , cancers don 't start out with a blood supply .
they start out as small , microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size ;
that 's the tip of a ballpoint pen .
then they can 't get any larger because they don 't have a blood supply , so they don 't have enough oxygen or nutrients .
in fact , we 're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body .
autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts ,
about 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers ,
and virtually 100 percent of us , by the time we reach our 70s , will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid .
yet , without a blood supply , most of these cancers will never become dangerous .
dr. judah folkman , who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field , once called this " cancer without disease . "
so the body 's ability to balance angiogenesis , when it 's working properly , prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers .
and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer .
in fact , if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells , tumors simply can 't grow up .
but once angiogenesis occurs , cancers can grow exponentially .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors , natural fertilizer , that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer .
and once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues .
and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases .
and , unfortunately , this late stage of cancer is the one at which it 's most likely to be diagnosed , when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .
so , if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one , then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it 's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body :
they 're abnormal ; they 're very poorly constructed ; and , because of that , they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .
in effect , when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a glioma , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved .
here 's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called avastin , which is fda approved . and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment .
well , i 've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .
so , a few years ago , i asked myself , " can we take this one step further and treat other cancers , even in other species ? "
so here is a nine year-old boxer named milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder .
it invaded into his lungs .
his veterinarian only gave him three months to live .
so we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an antiangiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor .
and within a few weeks of treatment , we were able to slow down that cancer 's growth such that we were ultimately able to extend milo 's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted , all with a very good quality of life .
and we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs .
we have about a 60 percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized .
so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples .
this is 20-year-old dolphin living in florida , and she had these lesions in her mouth that , over the course of three years , developed into invasive squamous cell cancers .
so we created an antiangiogenic paste .
we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week .
and over the course of seven months , the cancers completely disappeared , and the biopsies came back as normal .
here 's a cancer growing on the lip of a wuarter horse named guinness .
it 's a very , very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma .
it had already spread to his lymph nodes , so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail , so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .
and over the course of six months , he experienced a complete remission .
and here he is six years later , guinness , with his very happy owner .
now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers .
and , in fact , the first pioneering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
there 's 12 different drugs , 11 different cancer types . but the real question is : how well do these work in practice ?
so here 's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .
the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
but starting in 2004 , when antiangiogenic therapies first became available , well you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer , multiple myeloma , colorectal cancer , and gastrointestinal stromal tumors .
that 's impressive .
but for other tumors and cancer types , the improvements have only been modest .
so i started asking myself , " why haven 't we been able to do better ? "
and the answer , to me , is obvious ; we 're treating cancer too late in the game , when it 's already established and , oftentimes , it 's already spread or metastasized .
and as a doctor , i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage , achieving a cure can be difficult , if not impossible .
so i went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking : could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis , beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous ?
this could help healthy people as well as people who 've already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back .
so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer , i went back to look at cancer 's causes .
and what really intrigued me was when i saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers .
now , the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet , what to strip out , take away . but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : what could we be adding to our diet that 's naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body 's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
in other words , can we eat to starve cancer ?
well , the answer 's yes ,
and i 'm going to show you how .
our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet , because what we 've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
so here 's a test system we developed .
at the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion .
and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating .
so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes .
the active ingredient 's resveratrol ,
it 's also found in red wine .
this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent .
here 's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries ;
it potently inhibits angiogenesis .
and extract from soybeans .
and here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we 're interested in studying . for each food type , we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals .
and we want to measure this because , well , while you 're eating a strawberry or drinking tea , why not select the one that 's most potent for preventing cancer .
so here are four different teas that we 've tested .
they 're all common ones : chinese jasmine , japanese sencha , earl grey and a special blend that we prepared .
and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .
but what 's very cool is when we actually combined the two less potent teas together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
this means there 's food synergy .
here 's some more data from our testing .
now , in the lab , we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .
and using this system , we can test the potency of cancer drugs .
so the shorter the bar , less angiogenesis , that 's good .
and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people .
statins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others , they inhibit angiogenesis too .
and here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs .
you can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they 're more potent than the actual drugs .
soy , parsley , garlic , grapes , berries ; i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .
so imagine if we could create the world 's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic , cancer-preventative properties .
and that 's what we 're doing right now .
now , i 've shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ?
well , the best example i know is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years , in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer .
now , we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene , and lycopene is antiangiogenic .
but what 's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer , those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer .
so this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with dean ornish at ucsf and tufts university on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream .
now , obviously , what i 've shared with you has some far-ranging implications , even beyond cancer research .
because if we 're right , it could impact on consumer education , food services , public health and even the insurance industry .
and , in fact , some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines .
check out this ad from blue cross blue shield of minnesota .
and for many people around the world , dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments , but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local , sustainable , antiangiogenic crops .
now , finally , i 've talked to you about food , and i 've talked to you about cancer , so there 's just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that 's obesity .
because it turns out that adipose tissue , fat , is highly angiogenesis dependent .
and , like a tumor , fat grows when blood vessels grow .
so the question is : can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply ?
so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat , like this furry tennis ball .
and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse .
if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .
stop the treatment , gains the weight back .
restart the treatment , loses the weight again .
stop the treatment , it gains the weight back .
and , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis .
so this approach that we 're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can 't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse 's weight is supposed to be .
in other words , we can 't create supermodel mice .
and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points .
albert szent-gyorgi once said that , " discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen , and thinking what no one has thought . "
i hope i 've convinced you that , for diseases like cancer , obesity and other conditions , that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator : angiogenesis .
and that 's what i think the world needs now . thank you .
june cohen : i have a quick question for you . so these drugs aren 't exactly ... they 're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now .
for anyone out here who has cancer , what would you recommend ?
do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
william li : so there are antiangiogenic treatments that are fda approved ,
and if you 're a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one , you should ask about them .
and there are many clinical trials .
the angiogenesis foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
so consider the approved ones , look for clinical trials , but then between what the doctor can do for you , we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves .
and this is one of the themes that i 'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can 't do for us , which is to use knowledge and take action .
and if mother nature has given us some clues , we think that there might be a new future in the value of how we eat .
and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day .
jc : right . and along those lines , for people who might have risk factors for cancer , would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?
wl : well , you know , there 's abundant epidemiological evidence .
and i think in the information age , it doesn 't take long to go to a credible source like pubmed , the national library of medicine , to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications .
and that 's certainly something that anybody can look into .
jc : okay . well , thank you so much .

scott kim takes apart the art of puzzles
for the last 20 years i 've been designing puzzles .
and i 'm here today to give you a little tour , starting from the very first puzzle i designed , through what i 'm doing now .
i 've designed puzzles for books , printed things .
i 'm the puzzle columnist for discover magazine .
i 've been doing that for about 10 years .
i have a monthly puzzle calendar .
i do toys . the bulk of my work is in computer games .
i did puzzles for " bejeweled . "
i didn 't invent " bejeweled . " i can 't take credit for that .
so , very first puzzle , sixth grade , my teacher said , " oh , let 's see , that guy , he likes to make stuff .
i 'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board . "
i thought this was a great assignment .
and so here is what i came up with . i start fiddling with it .
i came up with this letter . this is a letter of the alphabet that 's been folded just once .
the question is , which letter is it if i unfold it ?
one hint : it 's not " l. "
it could be an " l , " of course .
so , what else could it be ?
yeah , a lot of you got it .
oh yeah . so , clever thing .
now , that was my first puzzle . i got hooked .
i created something new , i was very excited because , you know , i 'd made crossword puzzles , but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix .
this was something really original . i got hooked .
i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american .
went on , and eventually decided to devote myself , full time , to that .
now , i should pause and say , what do i mean by puzzle ?
a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer .
" fun to solve , " as opposed to everyday problems , which , frankly , are not very well-designed puzzles .
you know , they might have a solution . it might take a long time . nobody wrote down the rules clearly .
who designed this ?
it 's like , you know , life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies .
well , i take everyday problems , and i make puzzles out of them .
and " right answer , " of course there might be more than one right answer ; many puzzles have more than one .
but as opposed to a couple other forms of play , toys and games -- by toy i mean , something you play with that doesn 't have a particular goal .
you can create one out of legos . you know , you can do anything you want .
or competitive games like chess where , well , you 're not trying to solve ... you can make a chess puzzle , but the goal really is to beat another player .
i consider that puzzles are an art form .
they 're very ancient . it goes back as long as there is written history .
it 's a very small form , like a joke , a poem , a magic trick or a song , very compact form .
at worst , they 're throwaways , they 're for amusement .
but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .
the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact .
so , one thing i found early on , when i started doing computer games , is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception .
i 'll show you how . here is a famous one .
so , it 's two profiles in black , or a white vase in the middle .
this is called a figure-ground illusion .
the artist m.c. escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints . here we have " day and night . "
here is what i did with figure and ground .
so , here we have " figure " in black .
here we have " figure " in white .
and it 's all part of the same design .
the background to one is the other .
originally i tried to do the words " figure " and " ground . "
but i couldn 't do that , i realized . i changed the problem .
it 's all " figure . "
a few other things . here is my name .
and that turns into the title of my first book , " inversions . "
these sorts of designs now go by the word " ambigram . "
i 'll show you just a couple others . here we have the numbers one through 10 , the digits zero through nine , actually .
each letter here is one of these digits .
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .
i like pushing on what an ambigram can mean .
here 's the word " mirror . " no , it 's not the same upside-down . it 's the same this way .
and a marvelous fellow from the media lab who just got appointed head of risd , is john maeda .
and so i did this for him . it 's sort of a visual canon .
and recently in magic magazine i 've done a number of ambigrams on magician 's names .
so here we have penn and teller , same upside-down . this appears in my puzzle calendar .
okay , let 's go back to the slides .
thank you very much .
now , those are fun to look at .
now how would you do it interactively ?
for a while i was an interface designer .
and so i think a lot about interaction .
well , let 's first of all simplify the vases illusion ,
make the thing on the right .
now , if you could pick up the black vase , it would look like the figure on top .
if you could pick up the white area , it would look like the figure on the bottom .
well , you can 't do that physically ,
but on a computer you can do it . let 's switch over to the p.c .
and here it is , figure-ground .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
and this follows the rules i just said : any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up . but that is also true of any white area .
so , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
i 'll just go one step further .
so , here is -- here is a couple pieces . move them together , and now this is an active piece .
you can really get inside somebody 's perception and have them experience something .
it 's like the old maxim of " you can tell somebody something and show them , but if they do it they really learn it . "
here is another thing you can do .
there is a game called rush hour . this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubik 's cube .
so , here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place .
the goal is to get the red car out . it 's a sliding block puzzle .
it 's made by the company think fun .
it 's done very well . i love this puzzle .
well , let 's play one . here . so , here is a very simple puzzle .
well , that 's too simple , let 's add another piece .
okay , so how would you solve this one ?
well , move the blue one out of the way .
here , let 's make it a little harder . still pretty easy .
now we 'll make it harder , a little harder .
now , this one is a little bit trickier . you know ? what do you do here ?
the first move is going to be what ?
you 're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right .
and you can make puzzles like this one that aren 't solvable at all .
those four are locked in a pinwheel ; you can 't get them apart .
i wanted to make a sequel .
i didn 't come up with the original idea . but this is another way i work as an inventor is to create a sequel .
i came up with this . this is railroad rush hour .
it 's the same basic game except i introduced a new piece , a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically .
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back .
created a whole bunch of levels for it . now i 'm making it available to schools .
and it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles , but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science , other areas .
so , i 'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them .
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .
you know , he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon .
in discover magazine , i 'm an investigative puzzle maker .
i got interested in gene sequencing .
and i said , " well , how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ? "
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overlaps ,
and you basically match them at the edges . and i said , " this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle , except the pieces overlap . "
so , here is what i created for discover magazine .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
you know , you can 't cut out the pieces and move them around .
so , here is the nine pieces . and you 're supposed to put them into this grid .
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .
there is only one solution . it 's not that hard .
but it takes some persistence .
and when you 're done , it makes this design , which , if you squint , is the word " helix . "
so , that 's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content , rather than the other way around .
here is a couple more . here is a physics-based puzzle .
which way will these fall ?
one of these weighs 50 pounds , 30 pounds and 10 pounds .
and depending on which one weighs which amount , they 'll fall different directions .
and here is a puzzle based on color mixing .
i separated this image into cyan , magenta , yellow , black , the basic printing colors , and then mixed up the separations , and you get these peculiar pictures .
which separations were mixed up to make those pictures ?
gets you thinking about color .
finally , what i 'm doing now . so , shufflebrain.com , website you can go visit , i joined up with my wife , amy-jo kim .
she could easily be up here giving a talk about her work .
so , we 're making smart games for social media .
i 'll explain what that means . we 're looking at three trends .
this is what 's going on in the games industry right now .
first of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like " doom , " where you 're going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . right ? that 's who plays computer games .
well , guess what ? that 's changing .
" bejeweled " is a big hit . it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games .
and the main players are over 35 , and are female .
then recently " rock band " has been a big hit .
and it 's a game you play with other people . it 's very physical . it looks nothing like a traditional game . this is what 's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming .
now , within that there is some interesting things happening .
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you . why ? well , we aging boomers , baby boomers , we 're eating our healthy food , we 're exercising . what about our minds ?
oh no , our parents are getting alzheimer 's . we better do something .
turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of alzheimer 's .
so , we got games like " brain age " coming out for the nintendo ds , huge hit .
a lot of people do sudoku . in fact some doctors prescribe it .
and then there is social media , and what 's happening on the internet .
everybody now considers themselves a creator , and not just a viewer .
and what does this add up to ?
here is what we see coming .
it 's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle .
they 're part of your life . they 're not necessarily a separate thing .
and they are both , something that is good for you , and they 're fun .
i 'm a puzzle guy . my wife is an expert in social media .
and we decided to combine our skills . our first game is called " photo grab . " the game takes about a minute and 20 seconds .
this is your first time playing my game . okay .
let 's see how well we can do . there are three images . and we have 24 seconds each .
where is that ?
i 'll play as fast as i can .
but if you can see it , shout out the answer .
you get more -- down , okay , yeah where is that ?
oh , yeah . there , okay . j-o and -- i guess that 's that part . we got the bow . that bow helps .
that 's his hair . you get a lot of figure-ground problems .
yeah , that one is easy . okay . so , ahhh ! okay on to the next one .
okay , so that 's the lens .
anybody ?
looks like a black shape . so , where is that ?
that 's the corner of the whole thing .
yeah , i 've played this image before , but even when i make up my own puzzles -- and you can put your own images in here .
and we have people all over the world doing that now .
there we are . visit shufflebrain.com if you want to try it yourself . thank you .

eve ensler : embrace your inner girl
namaste . good morning .
i 'm very happy to be here in india .
and i 've been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly 11 years with v-day and " the vagina monologues , " traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
what i want to talk about today is this particular cell , or grouping of cells , that is in each and every one of us .
and i want to call it the girl cell .
and it 's in men as well as in women .
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell , the oppression of these cells , the reinterpretation of these cells , the undermining of these cells , getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing , eradicating , destroying , reducing these cells , basically began the process of killing off the girl cell , which was , by the way , patriarchy .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness .
and it is essential to balance , to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us .
and then i want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion , and it 's empathy , and it 's passion itself , and it 's vulnerability , and it 's openness , and it 's intensity , and it 's association , and it 's relationship , and it is intuitive .
and then let 's think how compassion informs wisdom , and that vulnerability is our greatest strength , and that emotions have inherent logic , which lead to radical , appropriate , saving action .
and then let 's remember that we 've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be , that compassion clouds your thinking , that vulnerability is weakness , that emotions are not to be trusted , and you 're not supposed to take things personally , which is one of my favorites .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
how do we bring up boys ? what does it mean to be a boy ?
to be a boy really means not to be a girl .
to be a man means not to be a girl .
to be a woman means not to be a girl .
to be strong means not to be a girl .
to be a leader means not to be a girl .
i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we 've had to train everyone not to be that .
and i 'd also like to say that the irony of course , is that denying girl , suppressing girl , suppressing emotion , refusing feeling has lead thus here .
where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence , the most horrific poverty , genocide , mass rapes , the destruction of the earth , is completely out of control .
and because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl-ship , we do not feel what is going on .
so , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening .
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .
for me , it was the turning point of my life .
i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years .
i feel up to that point i had seen a lot in the world , a lot of violence .
i essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years .
but the democratic republic of congo really was the turning point in my soul .
i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital , with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person i 've ever met .
his name is dr. denis mukwege .
in the congo , for those of you who don 't know , there has been a war raging for the last 12 years , a war that has killed nearly six million people .
it is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there .
when i spent my first weeks at panzi hospital i sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories .
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered .
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled , and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically , all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them .
my mind was so shattered .
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me
in a way i have never been emboldened .
that shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the earth , and excavating the earth , and destroying things .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , used to beat me .
and he would actually say , while he was beating me , " don 't you cry . don 't you dare cry . "
because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
and even in the moment he didn 't want to be reminded of what he was doing .
i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
and i want to say we 've annihilated it in men as well as in women .
and i think in some ways we 've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell .
i see how boys have been brought up , and i see this across the planet : to be tough , to be hardened , to distance themselves from their tenderness , to not cry .
i actually realized once in kosovo , when i watched a man break down , that bullets are actually hardened tears , that when we don 't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability , and have their compassion , and have their hearts , that they become hardened and hurtful and violent .
and i think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure , to pretend they know things when they don 't know things , or why would we be where we are ?
to pretend they 're not a mess when they are a mess .
and i will tell you a very funny story .
on my way here on the airplane , i was walking up and down the aisle of the plane .
and all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chick flicks .
and they were all alone , and i thought , " this is the secret life of men . "
i 've traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i 've seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it 's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world .
and we heard from sunitha yesterday , and kavita about what we do to girls .
but i just want to say that i 've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns , who are literally being treated like ashtrays .
i 've seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
i 've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles .
i 've seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves .
i 've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate , or we make them feel bad about being too smart .
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense .
we sell them , we kill them as embryos ,
we enslave them , we rape them .
we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities .
the selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
and in many places they are worth less than goats and cows .
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity .
and if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be , including lack of access to healthcare , education , healthy foods , labor force participation .
the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings ,
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers .
the state of girls , the condition of girls , will , in my belief -- and that 's the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives .
and what i want to suggest is that , having talked to girls , because i just finished a new book called " i am an emotional creature : the secret life of girls around the world , " i 've been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that i 've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that 's been enforced on girl is the verb " to please . "
girls are trained to please .
i want to change the verb .
i want us all to change the verb .
i want the verb to be " educate , " or " activate , " or " engage , " or " confront , " or " defy , " or " create . "
if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them .
and i have to now share a few stories of girls i 've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl , who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them .
i know a 14-year-old girl in the netherlands , for example , who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face .
there is a girl , julia butterfly hill , who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks .
there is a girl who i met 14 years ago in afghanistan who i have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed . her mother was a revolutionary .
and this girl , when she was 17 years old , wore a burqa in afghanistan , and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women , underneath her burqa , with a video .
and that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9 / 11 to show what was going on in afghanistan .
i want to talk about rachel corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an israeli tank to say , " end the occupation . "
and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank .
and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu , who was impregnated by her rapist .
and she was holding her baby .
and i asked her if she loved her baby .
and she looked into her baby 's eyes and she said , " of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
it 's my baby and it 's full of love . " the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels , to me , is mind-blowing .
there is a girl named dorcas , and i just met her in kenya .
dorcas is 15 years old , and she was trained in self-defense .
a few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men .
they kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
and through her self-defense , she grabbed their adam 's apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
in kenya , in august , i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .
agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female genitally mutilated .
and she made a decision as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls .
so , for years agnes walked through the rift valley .
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mutilated vagina looked like .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , " well , if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster . " so , we got her a jeep . and then she saved 4,500 girls .
and then we asked her , " okay , what else do you need ? " and she said , " well , now , i need a house . " so , seven years ago agnes built the first v-day safe house in narok , kenya , in the masai land .
and it was a house where girls could run away , they could save their clitoris , they wouldn 't be cut , they could go to school .
and in the years that agnes has had the house , she has changed the situation there .
she has literally become deputy mayor .
she 's changed the rules .
the whole community has bought in to what she 's doing .
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls , who have run away , with their families .
and there was a young girl named jaclyn .
jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her masai family and there 's a drought in kenya .
so cows are dying , and cows are the most valued possession .
and jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows .
and she knew that meant she would be cut .
she knew that meant she wouldn 't go to school .
she knew that meant she wouldn 't have a future .
she knew she would have to marry that old man , and she was 14 .
so , one afternoon , she 'd heard about the safe house , jaclyn left her father 's house and she walked for two days , two days through masai land .
she slept with the hyenas . she hid at night .
she imagined her father killing her on one hand , and mama agnes greeting her , with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .
and when she got to the house she was greeted .
agnes took her in , and agnes loved her ,
and agnes supported her for the year .
she went to school and she found her voice , and she found her identity , and she found her heart .
then , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation , after a year .
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .
in that hut , we walked in , and her father and his four wives were sitting there , and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled , and her primary mother , who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying .
he said , " you are beautiful . you have grown into a gorgeous woman .
we will not cut you .
and i give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your sisters either . "
and what she said to him was , " you were willing to sell me for four cows , and a calf and some blankets .
but i promise you , now that i will be educated i will always take care of you , and i will come back and i will build you a house .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . " for me , that is the power of girls .
and that is the power of transformation .
i want to close today with a new piece from my book .
and i want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here .
and i want to do it for sunitha .
and i want to do it for the girls that sunitha talked about yesterday , the girls who survive , the girls who can become somebody else .
but i really want to do it for each and every person here , to value the girl in us , to value the part that cries , to value the part that 's emotional , to value the part that 's vulnerable , to understand that 's where the future lies . this is called " i 'm an emotional creature . " and it happened because i met a girl in watts , l.a .
i was asking girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , " no , i hate it . i can 't stand it .
it 's all bad . my brothers get everything . " and this girl just sat up and went , " i love being a girl .
i 'm an emotional creature ! " this is for her : i love being a girl .
i can feel what you 're feeling as you 're feeling inside the feeling before .
i am an emotional creature .
things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas .
they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
oh , i know when your girlfriend 's really pissed off , even though she appears to give you what you want .
i know when a storm is coming .
i can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
i can tell you he won 't call back . it 's a vibe i share .
i am an emotional creature .
i love that i do not take things lightly .
everything is intense to me , the way i walk in the street , the way my momma wakes me up , the way it 's unbearable when i lose , the way i hear bad news .
i am an emotional creature .
i am connected to everything and everyone . i was born like that .
don 't you say all negative that it 's only only a teenage thing , or it 's only because i 'm a girl .
these feelings make me better .
they make me present . they make me ready . they make me strong .
i am an emotional creature .
there is a particular way of knowing . it 's like the older women somehow forgot .
i rejoice that it 's still in my body .
oh , i know when the coconut 's about to fall .
i know we have pushed the earth too far .
i know my father isn 't coming back , and that no one 's prepared for the fire .
i know that lipstick means more than show , and boys are super insecure , and so-called terrorists are made , not born .
i know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability .
and you know what ? sometimes it should .
this is not extreme . it 's a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open .
don 't tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
i am an emotional creature .
it 's how the earth got made , how the wind continues to pollinate .
you don 't tell the atlantic ocean to behave .
i am an emotional creature .
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
i am your remaining memory .
i can take you back .
nothing 's been diluted .
nothing 's leaked out .
i love , hear me , i love that i can feel the feelings inside you , even if they stop my life , even if they break my heart , even if they take me off track , they make me responsible .
i am an emotional , i am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature .
and i love , hear me , i love , love , love being a girl .
can you say it with me ?
i love , i love , love , love being a girl !
thank you very much .

ron eglash on african fractals
i want to start my story in germany , in 1877 , with a mathematician named georg cantor .
and cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line , and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process , a recursive process .
so he starts out with one line , and then two , and then four , and then 16 , and so on .
and if he does this an infinite number of times , which you can do in mathematics , he ends up with an infinite number of lines , each of which has an infinite number of points in it .
so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium .
and when he came out of the sanitarium , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself .
he was a very religious man .
he was a mathematician on a mission .
and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing .
a swedish mathematician , von koch , decided that instead of subtracting lines , he would add them .
and so he came up with this beautiful curve .
and there 's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape ; we can use any seed shape we like .
and i 'll rearrange this and i 'll stick this somewhere -- down there , ok -- and now upon iteration , that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure .
so these all have the property of self-similarity : the part looks like the whole .
it 's the same pattern at many different scales .
now , mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
and since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times , as the ruler shrinks down to infinity , the length goes to infinity .
this made no sense at all ,
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books .
they said these are pathological curves , and we don 't have to discuss them . and that worked for a hundred years .
and then in 1977 , benoit mandelbrot , a french mathematician , realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals , you get the shapes of nature .
you get the human lungs , you get acacia trees , you get ferns , you get these beautiful natural forms .
if you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet -- go ahead and do that now -- -- and relax your hand , you 'll see a crinkle , and then a wrinkle within the crinkle , and a crinkle within the wrinkle . right ?
your body is covered with fractals .
the mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes ?
they were breathing those words with fractal lungs .
it 's very ironic . and i 'll show you a little natural recursion here .
again , we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape .
so here 's the second iteration , and the third , fourth and so on .
so nature has this self-similar structure .
nature uses self-organizing systems .
now in the 1980s , i happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an african village , you see fractals .
and i thought , " this is fabulous ! i wonder why ? " and of course i had to go to africa and ask folks why .
so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
and so i finally got to this city , and i 'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when i got there , i got to the palace of the chief , and my french is not very good ; i said something like , " i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof . " but he was really cool about it , and he took me up there , and we talked about fractals .
and he said , " oh yeah , yeah ! we knew about a rectangle within a rectangle , we know all about that . " and it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle , and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here .
and as you go through the path , you have to get more and more polite .
so they 're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling ; it 's a conscious pattern . it is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal .
this is a village in southern zambia .
the ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter .
you have a huge ring .
the rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back , and then you have the chief 's ring here towards the back and then the chief 's immediate family in that ring .
so here 's a little fractal model for it .
here 's one house with the sacred altar , here 's the house of houses , the family enclosure , with the humans here where the sacred altar would be , and then here 's the village as a whole -- a ring of ring of rings with the chief 's extended family here , the chief 's immediate family here , and here there 's a tiny village only this big .
now you might wonder , how can people fit in a tiny village only this big ? that 's because they 're spirit people . it 's the ancestors .
and of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village , right ?
so it 's just like georg cantor said , the recursion continues forever .
this is in the mandara mountains , near the nigerian border in cameroon , mokoulek .
i saw this diagram drawn by a french architect , and i thought , " wow ! what a beautiful fractal ! " so i tried to come up with a seed shape , which , upon iteration , would unfold into this thing .
i came up with this structure here .
let 's see , first iteration , second , third , fourth .
now , after i did the simulation , i realized the whole village kind of spirals around , just like this , and here 's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal .
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
so , when i got to the village , i said , " can you take me to the square building ?
i think something 's going on there . " and they said , " well , we can take you there , but you can 't go inside because that 's the sacred altar , where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields . " and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
and the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales .
so here 's a nankani village in mali .
and you can see , you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here 's pots in the fireplace , stacked recursively .
here 's calabashes that issa was just showing us , and they 're stacked recursively .
now , the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman 's soul .
and when she dies , they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity .
once again , infinity is important .
now , you might ask yourself three questions at this point .
aren 't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture ?
and that was actually my original hypothesis .
when i first saw those african fractals , i thought , " wow , so any indigenous group that doesn 't have a state society , that sort of hierarchy , must have a kind of bottom-up architecture . " but that turns out not to be true .
i started collecting aerial photographs of native american and south pacific architecture ; only the african ones were fractal .
and if you think about it , all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use .
so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .
you can see on the pottery and the baskets .
here 's an aerial photograph of one of the anasazi ruins ; you can see it 's circular at the largest scale , but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale , right ?
it is not the same pattern at two different scales .
second , you might ask , " well , dr. eglash , aren 't you ignoring the diversity of african cultures ? " and three times , the answer is no .
first of all , i agree with mudimbe 's wonderful book , " the invention of africa , " that africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism , and then oppositional movements .
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn 't necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not " in the dna . "
and finally , the fractals have self-similarity -- so they 're similar to themselves , but they 're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals .
it 's a shared technology in africa .
and finally , well , isn 't this just intuition ?
it 's not really mathematical knowledge .
africans can 't possibly really be using fractal geometry , right ?
it wasn 't invented until the 1970s .
well , it 's true that some african fractals are , as far as i 'm concerned , just pure intuition .
so some of these things , i 'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people , " what 's the algorithm ? what 's the rule for making this ? " and they 'd say , " well , we just make it that way because it looks pretty , stupid . " but sometimes , that 's not the case .
in some cases , there would actually be algorithms , and very sophisticated algorithms .
so in manghetu sculpture , you 'd see this recursive geometry .
in ethiopian crosses , you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape .
in angola , the chokwe people draw lines in the sand , and it 's what the german mathematician euler called a graph ; we now call it an eulerian path -- you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice .
but they do it recursively , and they do it with an age-grade system , so the little kids learn this one , and then the older kids learn this one , then the next age-grade initiation , you learn this one .
and with each iteration of that algorithm , you learn the iterations of the myth .
you learn the next level of knowledge .
and finally , all over africa , you see this board game .
it 's called owari in ghana , where i studied it ; it 's called mancala here on the east coast , bao in kenya , sogo elsewhere .
well , you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game .
and the folks in ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns and would use them strategically .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
here 's a wonderful fractal .
anywhere you go in the sahel , you 'll see this windscreen .
and of course fences around the world are all cartesian , all strictly linear .
but here in africa , you 've got these nonlinear scaling fences .
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , " how come you 're making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . " and his answer was very interesting .
he said , " well , if i lived in the jungle , i would only use the long rows of straw because they 're very quick and they 're very cheap .
it doesn 't take much time , doesn 't take much straw . " he said , " but wind and dust goes through pretty easily .
now , the tight rows up at the very top , they really hold out the wind and dust .
but it takes a lot of time , and it takes a lot of straw because they 're really tight . " " now , " he said , " we know from experience that the farther up from the ground you go , the stronger the wind blows . " right ? it 's just like a cost-benefit analysis .
and i measured out the lengths of straw , put it on a log-log plot , got the scaling exponent , and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook .
so these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .
the most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry , it was in a symbolic code , and this was bamana sand divination .
and the same divination system is found all over africa .
you can find it on the east coast as well as the west coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits -- it 's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it 's an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it 's an even number , you put down two strokes . and they did this very rapidly , and i couldn 't understand where they were getting -- they only did the randomness four times -- i couldn 't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols .
and they wouldn 't tell me .
they said , " no , no , i can 't tell you about this . "
and i said , " well look , i 'll pay you , you can be my teacher , and i 'll come each day and pay you . " they said , " it 's not a matter of money . this is a religious matter . "
and finally , out of desperation , i said , " well , let me explain georg cantor in 1877 . " and i started explaining why i was there in africa , and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set .
and one of them said , " come here . i think i can help you out here . " and so he took me through the initiation ritual for a bamana priest .
and of course , i was only interested in the math , so the whole time , he kept shaking his head going , " you know , i didn 't learn it this way . " but i had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed , buried in sand , and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on .
and finally , he revealed the truth of the matter .
and it turns out it 's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos .
when you have a four-bit symbol , you then put it together with another one sideways .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
odd plus even gives you odd .
even plus even gives you even . odd plus odd gives you even .
it 's addition modulo 2 , just like in the parity bit check on your computer .
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self-generating diversity of symbols .
they 're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this .
now , because it 's a binary code , you can actually implement this in hardware -- what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in african engineering schools .
and the most interesting thing i found out about it was historical .
in the 12th century , hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain .
and there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy : divination through the earth .
this is a geomantic chart drawn for king richard ii in 1390 .
leibniz , the german mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called " de combinatoria . " and he said , " well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let 's use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . " right ? ones and zeros , the binary code .
george boole took leibniz 's binary code and created boolean algebra , and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer .
so all these little pdas and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in africa .
and i know brian eno says there 's not enough africa in computers , but you know , i don 't think there 's enough african history in brian eno .
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we 've found for this .
and you can go to our website , the applets are all free ; they just run in the browser .
anybody in the world can use them .
the national science foundation 's broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools , so hopefully in three years , anybody 'll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts .
we 've focused in the u.s. on african-american students as well as native american and latino .
we 've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software .
so it 's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that 's about mathematics , that it 's not just about singing and dancing .
we 've started a pilot program in ghana . we got a small seed grant , just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this ; we 're very excited about the future possibilities for that .
we 've also been working in design .
i didn 't put his name up here -- my colleague , kerry , in kenya , has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure , because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village , it doesn 't quite fit .
bernard tschumi at columbia university has finished using this in a design for a museum of african art .
david hughes at ohio state university has written a primer on afrocentric architecture in which he 's used some of these fractal structures .
and finally , i just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization , as we heard earlier , it 's in the brain .
it 's in the -- it 's in google 's search engine .
actually , the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .
it 's in ecological sustainability .
it 's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
it 's also in some bad things .
self-organization is why the aids virus is spreading so fast .
and if you don 't think that capitalism , which is self-organizing , can have destructive effects , you haven 't opened your eyes enough .
so we need to think about , as was spoken earlier , the traditional african methods for doing self-organization .
these are robust algorithms .
these are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship -- that are gentle , that are egalitarian .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms .
thank you .

mark shaw : one very dry demo
i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at .
you 're about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
it 's called ultra-ever dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield .
so this is a cinder block , uncoated , and you can see that it 's porous , it absorbs water .
not anymore .
porous , nonporous .
so what 's superhydrophobic ?
superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
the rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it 's really round , it 's superhydrophobic .
a freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees .
a windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
but what you 're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic .
so as part of the demonstration , what i have is a pair of gloves , and we 've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let 's see if you can tell which one , and i 'll give you a hint .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
and we 're talking really small here .
the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter ,
and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you 'd be the width of a human hair .
so very small , but very useful .
and it 's not just water that this works with . it 's a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
you can see the difference .
moving onto the next demonstration , we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it , we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating , and we 're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle , and you 're going to see , it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would , except when it hits the coating , it stops , and i can 't even coax it to leave .
it 's that afraid of the water .
so what 's going on here ? what 's happening ?
well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface .
you 'd think it 'd be smooth , but it 's actually not .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
it 's an umbrella of air all across it ,
and that layer of air is what the water hits , the mud hits , the concrete hits , and it glides right off .
so if i put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it 's dry .
so what are the applications ?
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , " oh , i could use it for this and this and this . " the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's anti-wetting . we 've certainly seen that today .
it could be anything that 's anti-icing , because if you don 't have water , you don 't have ice .
it could be anti-corrosion .
no water , no corrosion .
it could be anti-bacterial .
without water , the bacteria won 't survive .
and it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well .
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
it 's going to happen . wait for it . wait for it .

♫ jill sobule : at a conference in monterey by the big , big jellyfish tank , ♫ ♫ i first saw you and i got so shy . ♫ ♫ you see , i was a little paranoid ' cause i might have been high . ♫ ♫ and i hadn 't done that in ages and i won 't do that again . ♫ ♫ but that 's another story . ♫ ♫ loved you forever and i 've been a big fan , ♫ ♫ the one-woman shows , i even rented " pat . " ♫ ♫ i got enough nerve to come up to you , ♫ ♫ but little did i know one year later we 'd be doing this show . ♫ ♫ i sing . julia sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sobule : sometimes it works . sweeney : sometimes it doesn 't . ♫ ♫ together : the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sweeney : at a conference in monterey next to the big , big jellyfish tank , ♫ ♫ i first saw you and i wasn 't so shy . ♫ i made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan i was
ever since i was writing that pilot for fox , and wendy and i wanted you to do the theme song .
and then the pilot didn 't go and i was so sad , but i kept remaining a fan of yours .
and then when i went through that big , horrible breakup with carl and i couldn 't get off the couch , i listened to your song , ♫ " now that i don 't have you , " ♫ over and over and over and over again .
and i can 't believe you 're here and that i 'm meeting you here at ted .
and also , i can 't believe that we 're eating sushi in front of the fish tank , which , personally , i think is really inappropriate .
and little did i know that one year later ... ♫ we 'd be doing this show . ♫ ♫ sobule : i sing . sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . ♫ sobule : hey , they asked us back ! sweeney : can you stand it ? !
♫ together : the jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sobule : why are all our heroes so imperfect ? ♫ ♫ why do they always bring me down ? ♫ ♫ why are all our heroes so imperfect ? ♫ ♫ statue in the park has lost his crown . ♫ ♫ william faulkner , drunk and depressed . ♫ sweeney : mmm . ♫ dorothy parker , mean , drunk and depressed . ♫ sweeney : i know . ♫ and that guy , " seven years in tibet , " turned out to be a nazi . ♫ sweeney : yeah . ♫ founding fathers all had slaves . ♫ sweeney : i know . ♫ the explorers slaughtered the braves . ♫ sweeney : horribly .
♫ sobule : the old testament god can be so petty . ♫ sweeney : don 't get me started on that .
♫ sobule : paul mccartney , jealous of john , even more so now that he 's gone . ♫ ♫ dylan was so mean to donovan in that movie . ♫ ♫ pablo picasso , cruel to his wives . ♫ sweeney : horrible .
♫ sobule : my favorite poets took their own lives . ♫ ♫ orson welles peaked at twenty-five , below before our eyes . ♫ ♫ and he sold bad wine . ♫ ♫ together : why are all our heroes so imperfect ? yeah ♫ ♫ why do they always bring me down ? ♫ ♫ sobule : heard babe ruth was full of malice . ♫ sweeney : oh . ♫ lewis carroll i 'm sure did alice . ♫ sweeney : what ? ! ♫ plato in the cave with those very young boys . ♫ sweeney : ooh ...
♫ sobule : hillary supported the war . ♫ ♫ sweeney : even thomas friedman supported the war . ♫ ♫ sobule : colin powell turned out to be ... together : ... such a pussy . ♫ ♫ sobule : william faulkner , drunk and depressed , ♫ ♫ tennessee williams , drunk and depressed . ♫ sweeney : yeah . ♫ sobule : take it , julia . ♫
sweeney : okay . oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine .
i mean , i watch oprah mostly when i 'm home in spokane visiting my mother . and to my mother , oprah is a greater moral authority than the pope , which is actually saying something because she 's a devout catholic .
anyway , i like oprah -- i like her girlfriendy-ness ,
i like her weight issues ,
i like how she 's transformed talk television ,
i like how she 's brought reading back to america --
but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... i call it the soon-yi moment :
it is the moment when i cannot continue supporting someone .
and that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie " the secret . "
do you guys know about that movie " the secret " ?
it makes " what the bleep do we know " seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that 's how bad it is .
it makes " the davinci code " seem like " war and peace . "
that movie is so horrible . it promotes such awful pseudoscience .
and the basic idea is that there 's this law of attraction , and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you .
on a scientific basis , it 's more than just " power of positive thinking " -- it has a horrible , horrible dark side . like if you get ill , it 's because you 've just been thinking negative thoughts .
yeah , stuff like that was in the movie and she 's promoting it .
and all i 'm saying is that i really wish that murray gell-mann would go on oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law .
so that 's what i have to say .
♫ sobule : i sing . sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sobule : sometimes it works . sweeney : sometimes it doesn 't . ♫ ♫ together : the jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show . ♫

insects and animals have evolved some amazing skills -- but , as robert full notes , many animals are actually over-engineered . the trick is to copy only what 's necessary . he shows how human engineers can learn from animals ' tricks .

robert full on engineering and evolution
welcome . if i could have the first slide , please ?
contrary to calculations made by some engineers , bees can fly , dolphins can swim , and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces . now , what i want to do , in the short time i have , is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature 's design .
i get to do this all the time , and it 's just incredible .
i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation .
the challenge of looking at nature 's designs -- and i 'll tell you the way that we perceive it , and the way we 've used it .
the challenge , of course , is to answer this question : what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?
and if we could figure that out , how can we implement those designs ?
well , many biologists will tell engineers , and others , organisms have millions of years to get it right ; they 're spectacular ; they can do everything wonderfully well .
so , the answer is bio-mimicry : just copy nature directly .
we know from working on animals that the truth is that 's exactly what you don 't want to do -- because evolution works on the just-good-enough principle , not on a perfecting principle .
and the constraints in building any organism , when you look at it , are really severe . natural technologies have incredible constraints .
think about it . if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile , but it had to start off to be this big , then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile , i 'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .
and you can absolutely never , absolutely never , because of history and the inherited plan , start with a clean slate .
so , organisms have this important history .
really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer .
and this is really important when you begin to look at animals .
instead , we believe you need to be inspired by biology . you need to discover the general principles of nature , and then use these analogies when they 're advantageous .
this is a real challenge to do this , because animals , when you start to really look inside them -- how they work -- appear hopelessly complex . there 's no detailed history of the design plans , you can 't go look it up anywhere .
they have way too many motions for their joints , too many muscles . even the simplest animal we think of , something like an insect , and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine .
how can you make sense of this ? well , we believed --
and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply , is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves .
what we discovered was that two- , four- , six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move .
they all work like this kangaroo , they bounce .
and they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system because we 're biomechanists . it 's actually a pogo stick .
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick . how is that true ?
well , a human , one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog , or works like three legs , together as one , of a trotting insect , or four legs as one of a trotting crab .
and then they alternate in their propulsion , but the patterns are all the same . almost every organism we 've looked at this way -- you 'll see next week , i 'll give you a hint , there 'll be an article coming out that says that really big things like t. rex probably couldn 't do this , but you 'll see that next week .
now , what 's interesting is the animals , then -- we said -- bounce along the vertical plane this way , and in our collaborations with pixar , in " a bug 's life , " we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants .
and we told them , of course , they move in another plane as well . and they asked us this question . they say , " why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane , when you 're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane ? " this is a good question .
nobody in biology ever modeled it this way .
we took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well . we took their three legs , we collapsed them down as one . we got some of the best mathematicians in the world from princeton to work on this problem .
and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down , but they 're also bouncing side to side at the same time .
and many organisms fit this kind of pattern .
now , why is this important to have this model ?
because it 's very interesting . when you take this model and you perturb it , you give it a push , as it bumps into something , it self-stabilizes , with no brain or no reflexes , just by the structure alone .
it 's a beautiful model . let 's look at the mathematics . that 's enough !
the animals , when you look at them running , appear to be self-stabilizing like this , using basically springy legs . that is , the legs can do computations on their own ; the control algorithms , in a sense , are embedded in the form of the animal itself .
why haven 't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries ?
well , i would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies , at least they have been so far .
think about the typical kind of robot that you see .
human technologies have tended to be large , flat , with right angles , stiff , made of metal . they have rolling devices and axles . there are very few motors , very few sensors .
whereas nature tends to be small , and curved , and it bends and twists , and has legs instead , and appendages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
so it 's a very different design . however , what 's changing , what 's really exciting -- and i 'll show you some of that next -- is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature , then nature really can become a much more useful teacher .
and here 's one example that 's really exciting .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
and they developed this new technique , called shape deposition manufacturing . it 's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like , and put in the material properties .
they can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself .
for example , here 's a leg : the clear part is stiff , the white part is compliant , and you don 't need any axles there or anything .
it just bends by itself beautifully .
so , you can put those properties in . it inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named sprawl .
our work has also inspired another robot , a biologically inspired bouncing robot , from the university of michigan and mcgill named rhex , for robot hexapod , and this one 's autonomous .
let 's go to the video , and let me show you some of these animals moving
and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries .
here 's what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a treadmill .
here 's what we do . this is a death 's head cockroach . this is an american cockroach you think you don 't have in your kitchen .
this is an eight-legged scorpion , six-legged ant , forty-four-legged centipede .
now , i said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks -- they 're bouncing along as they move . and you can see that in this ghost crab , from the beaches of panama and north carolina .
it goes up to four meters per second when it runs .
it actually leaps into the air , and has aerial phases when it does it , like a horse , and you 'll see it 's bouncing here .
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard , or a cockroach , or a crab , or a kangaroo , the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we 've seen so far .
now , what good are springy legs then ? what can they do ?
well , we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability .
so , we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we 're looking at . and we were certain they couldn 't do this . and here 's what they did .
the animal ran over it and it didn 't even slow down !
it didn 't decrease its preferred speed at all .
we couldn 't believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , springy legs , you could make it as maneuverable as any that 's ever been built .
here 's the first example of that . this is the stanford shape deposition manufactured robot , named sprawl .
it has six legs -- there are the tuned , springy legs .
it moves in a gait that an insect uses , and here it is going on the treadmill . now , what 's important about this robot , compared to other robots , is that it can 't see anything , it can 't feel anything , it doesn 't have a brain , yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever .
it 's this technique of building the properties into the form .
this is a graduate student . this is what he 's doing to his thesis project -- very robust , if a graduate student does that to his thesis project .
this is from mcgill and university of michigan . this is the rhex , making its first outing in a demo .
same principle : it only has six moving parts ,
six motors , but it has springy , tuned legs . it moves in the gait of the insect . it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front , and the hind leg on the other side . sort of an alternating tripod , and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal .
robert full : it 'll go on different surfaces -- here 's sand -- although we haven 't perfected the feet yet , but i 'll talk about that later .
here 's rhex entering the woods .
again , this robot can 't see anything , it can 't feel anything , it has no brain . it 's just working with a tuned mechanical system , with very simple parts , but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal .
rf : here 's it going down a pathway .
i presented this to the jet propulsion lab at nasa , and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice , and life , ultimately , on mars . and he said -- especially with legged-robots , because they 're way too complicated .
nothing can do that . and i talk next . i showed them this video with the simple design of rhex here . and just to convince them we should go to mars in 2011 , i tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on mars .
another reason why animals have extraordinary performance , and can go anywhere , is because they have an effective interaction with the environment . the animal i 'm going to show you , that we studied to look at this , is the gecko .
we have one here and notice its position . it 's holding on .
now i 'm going to challenge you . i 'm going show you a video .
one of the animals is going to be running on the level , and the other one 's going to be running up a wall . which one 's which ?
they 're going at a meter a second . how many think the one on the left is running up the wall ?
okay . the point is it 's really hard to tell , isn 't it ? it 's incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn 't tell .
they can run up a wall at a meter a second , 15 steps per second , and they look like they 're running on the level . how do they do this ?
it 's just phenomenal . the one on the right was going up the hill .
how do they do this ? they have bizarre toes . they have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out , and then peel off the surface , like tape .
like if we had a piece of tape now , we 'd peel it this way .
they do this with their toes . it 's bizarre ! this peeling inspired irobot -- that we work with -- to build mecho-geckos .
here 's a legged version and a tractor version , or a bulldozer version .
let 's see some of the geckos move with some video , and then i 'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots .
here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
you can 't use regular cameras .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
and here 's some video at 1,000 frames per second .
now , i want you to look at the animal 's back .
do you see how much it 's bending like that ? we can 't figure that out -- that 's an unsolved mystery . we don 't know how it works .
if you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to berkeley , come to my lab and we 'll figure this out . okay , send them to berkeley because that 's the next thing i want to do . here 's the gecko mill .
it 's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt , so we can watch the animal 's feet , and videotape them through the treadmill belt , to see how they move .
here 's the animal that we have here , running on a vertical surface . pick a foot and try to watch a toe , and see if you can see what the animal 's doing .
see it uncurl and then peel these toes .
it can do this in 14 milliseconds . it 's unbelievable .
here are the robots that they inspire , the mecho-geckos from irobot .
first we 'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that .
and here 's the peeling action of the mecho-gecko . it uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it .
peeling in the animal . peeling in the mecho-gecko -- that allows them climb autonomously . can go on the flat surface , transition to a wall , and then go onto a ceiling .
there 's the bulldozer version . now , it doesn 't use pressure-sensitive glue .
the animal does not use that .
but that 's what we 're limited to , at the moment .
what does the animal do ? the animal has weird toes . and if you look at the toes , they have these little leaves there , and if you blow them up and zoom in , you 'll see that 's there 's little striations in these leaves .
and if you zoom in 270 times , you 'll see it looks like a rug .
and if you blow that up , and zoom in 900 times , you see there are hairs there , tiny hairs . and if you look carefully , those tiny hairs have striations . and if you zoom in on those 30,000 times , you 'll see each hair has split ends .
and if you blow those up , they have these little structures on the end .
the smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae , and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends ,
to get very close to the surface . in fact , there 's the diameter of your hair -- a gecko has two million of these , and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends .
think of the contact of that that 's possible .
we were fortunate to work with another group at stanford that built us a special manned sensor , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
here 's an individual hair with a little split end there . when we measured the forces , they were enormous . they were so large that a patch of hairs about this size -- the gecko 's foot could support the weight of a small child , about 40 pounds , easily . now , how do they do it ?
we 've recently discovered this . do they do it by friction ?
no , force is too low . do they do it by electrostatics ?
no , you can change the charge -- they still hold on .
do they do it by interlocking ? that 's kind of a like a velcro-like thing .
no , you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don 't do it .
how about suction ? they stick on in a vacuum .
how about wet adhesion ? or capillary adhesion ?
they don 't have any glue , and they even stick under water just fine .
if you put their foot under water , they grab on .
how do they do it then ? believe it or not , they grab on by intermolecular forces , by van der waals forces .
you know , you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry , where you had these two atoms , they 're close together , and the electrons are moving around . that tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it 's added up so many times with these small structures .
what we 're doing is , we 're taking that inspiration of the hairs , and with another colleague at berkeley , we 're manufacturing them .
and just recently we 've made a breakthrough , where we now believe we 're going to be able to create the first synthetic , self-cleaning ,
dry adhesive . many companies are interested in this .
we also presented to nike even .
we 'll see where this goes . we were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale -- and where everything gets sticky , and gravity doesn 't matter anymore -- we needed to look at ants and their feet , because one of my other colleagues at berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs . but it gets stuck . it doesn 't move very well .
but the ants do , and we 'll figure out why , so that ultimately we 'll make this move . and imagine : you 're going to be able to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around .
where 's this going ? i think you can see it already .
clearly , the internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . but it 's going to also have legs and hands .
you 're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots , so that you can run , fly and swim anywhere . we saw david kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish .
so , in conclusion , i think the message is clear .
if you need a message , if nature 's not enough , if you care about search and rescue , or mine clearance , or medicine , or the various things we 're working on , we must preserve nature 's designs , otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
thank you .

adam grosser and his sustainable fridge
this is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
narrator : on this planet , 1.6 billion people don 't have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels . this is a problem . it impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life . so here 's the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that doesn 't use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables . time for some thermodynamics . and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator . adam grosser : so 29 years ago , i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
it 's one of those things that stuck in my head .
it was a lot like the stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn 't know what to do with it .
and it was invented in 1858 , by this guy ferdinand carre , but he couldn 't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
this crazy canadian named powel crosley commercialized this thing called the icyball in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and i 'll get to why it didn 't work , but here 's how it works .
there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance .
one has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
you heat up one side , the hot side .
the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
you let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
so , it was a great idea that didn 't work at all : it blew up .
because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
it topped 400 psi . the ammonia was toxic . it sprayed everywhere .
but it was kind of an interesting thought .
so , the great thing about 2006 is there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do .
so , we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved --
a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
we found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
brought in a team from the u.k. -- there 's a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the u.k. -- and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
so , this is the way it works .
you put it on a cooking fire .
most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it 's camel dung or wood .
it heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it 's not quite done .
weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works . you put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing --
for 24 hours in a 30 degree c environment . it 's really cheap .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / sheryl _ sandberg _ why _ we _ have _ too _ few _ women _ leaders.html
facebook coo sheryl sandberg looks at why a smaller percentage of women than men reach the top of their professions -- and offers 3 powerful pieces of advice to women aiming for the c-suite .

sheryl sandberg : why we have too few women leaders
so for any of us in this room today , let 's start out by admitting we 're lucky .
we don 't live in the world our mothers lived in , our grandmothers lived in , where career choices for women were so limited .
and if you 're in this room today , most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights ,
and amazingly , we still live in a world where some women don 't have them .
but all that aside , we still have a problem , and it 's a real problem .
and the problem is this : women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .
the numbers tell the story quite clearly .
190 heads of state -- nine are women .
of all the people in parliament in the world , 13 percent are women .
in the corporate sector , women at the top , c-level jobs , board seats -- tops out at 15 , 16 percent .
the numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction .
and even in the non-profit world , a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women , women at the top : 20 percent .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .
a recent study in the u.s. showed that , of married senior managers , two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children .
a couple of years ago , i was in new york , and i was pitching a deal , and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture .
and i 'm in the meeting -- it 's about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in , there kind of needs to be that bio break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed .
and i realized he doesn 't know where the women 's room is in his office .
so i start looking around for moving boxes , figuring they just moved in , but i don 't see any .
and so i said , " did you just move into this office ? "
and he said , " no , we 've been here about a year . "
and i said , " are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ? "
and he looked at me , and he said , " yeah . or maybe you 're the only one who had to go to the bathroom . "
so the question is , how are we going to fix this ?
how do we change these numbers at the top ?
how do we make this different ?
i want to start out by saying , i talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because i really think that 's the answer .
in the high-income part of our workforce , in the people who end up at the top -- fortune 500 ceo jobs , or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem , i am convinced , is that women are dropping out .
now people talk about this a lot , and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women .
i want to talk about none of that today , even though that 's all really important .
today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals .
what are the messages we need to tell ourselves ?
what are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us ?
what are the messages we tell our daughters ?
now , at the outset , i want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments .
i don 't have the right answer . i don 't even have it for myself .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
and my daughter , who 's three , when i dropped her off at preschool , did that whole hugging-the-leg , crying , " mommy , don 't get on the plane " thing .
this is hard . i feel guilty sometimes .
i know no women , whether they 're at home or whether they 're in the workforce , who don 't feel that sometimes .
so i 'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone .
my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce ,
and i think there are three .
one , sit at the table .
two , make your partner a real partner .
and three , don 't leave before you leave .
number one : sit at the table .
just a couple weeks ago at facebook , we hosted a very senior government official , and he came in to meet with senior execs from around silicon valley .
and everyone kind of sat at the table .
and then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his department ,
and i kind of said to them , " sit at the table . come on , sit at the table , "
and they sat on the side of the room .
when i was in college my senior year , i took a course called european intellectual history . don 't you love that kind of thing from college ? i wish i could do that now .
and i took it with my roommate , carrie , who was then a brilliant literary student -- and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar -- and my brother -- smart guy , but a water-polo-playing pre-med , who was a sophomore .
the three of us take this class together .
and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin , goes to all the lectures . i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures .
my brother is kind of busy . he reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures , marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored .
the three of us go to the exam together , and we sit down .
and we sit there for three hours -- and our little blue notebooks -- yes , i 'm that old .
and we walk out , and we look at each other , and we say , " how did you do ? "
and carrie says , " boy , i feel like i didn 't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic . "
and i say , " god , i really wish i had really connected john locke 's theory of property with the philosophers who follow . "
and my brother says , " i got the top grade in the class . "
" you got the top grade in the class ?
you don 't know anything . "
the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows : women systematically underestimate their own abilities .
if you test men and women , and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas , men get it wrong slightly high , and women get it wrong slightly low .
women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
a study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering , or men , i guess , are negotiating their first salary , and only seven percent of women .
and most importantly , men attribute their success to themselves , and women attribute it to other external factors .
if you ask men why they did a good job , they 'll say , " i 'm awesome .
obviously . why are you even asking ? "
if you ask women why they did a good job , what they 'll say is someone helped them , they got lucky , they worked really hard .
why does this matter ?
boy , it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side , not at the table ,
and no one gets the promotion if they don 't think they deserve their success ,
or they don 't even understand their own success .
i wish the answer were easy .
i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work for , all these fabulous women , " believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself .
own your own success . "
i wish i could tell that to my daughter .
but it 's not that simple .
because what the data shows , above all else , is one thing , which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .
and everyone 's nodding , because we all know this to be true .
there 's a really good study that shows this really well .
there 's a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen .
and she 's an operator in a company in silicon valley , and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist .
in 2002 -- not so long ago -- a professor who was then at columbia university took that case and made it howard roizen .
and he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students .
he changed exactly one word : " heidi " to " howard . "
but that one word made a really big difference .
he then surveyed the students ,
and the good news was the students , both men and women , thought heidi and howard were equally competent ,
and that 's good .
the bad news was that everyone liked howard .
he 's a great guy . you want to work for him . you want to spend the day fishing with him .
but heidi ? not so sure .
she 's a little out for herself . she 's a little political .
you 're not sure you 'd want to work for her .
this is the complication .
we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues , we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a , to reach for the promotion , to sit at the table ,
and we have to do it in a world where , for them , there are sacrifices they will make for that , even though for their brothers , there are not .
the saddest thing about all of this is that it 's really hard to remember this .
and i 'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me , but i think important .
i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees ,
and a couple hours later , there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk , and she wanted to talk to me .
i said , okay , and she sat down , and we talked .
and she said , " i learned something today .
i learned that i need to keep my hand up . "
i said , " what do you mean ? "
she said , " well , you 're giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions .
and i had my hand up with lots of other people , and you took two more questions .
and i put my hand down , and i noticed all the women put their hand down ,
and then you took more questions , only from the men . "
and i thought to myself , wow , if it 's me -- who cares about this , obviously -- giving this talk -- and during this talk , i can 't even notice that the men 's hands are still raised , and the women 's hands are still raised , how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women ?
we 've got to get women to sit at the table .
message number two : make your partner a real partner .
i 've become convinced that we 've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home .
the data shows this very clearly .
if a woman and a man work full-time and have a child , the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does , and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does .
so she 's got three jobs or two jobs , and he 's got one .
who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more ?
the causes of this are really complicated , and i don 't have time to go into them .
and i don 't think sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause .
i think the cause is more complicated .
i think , as a society , we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls .
i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers ,
and it 's hard .
when i go to the mommy-and-me stuff and i see the father there , i notice that the other mommies don 't play with him .
and that 's a problem , because we have to make it as important a job , because it 's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home , for people of both genders , if we 're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .
studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate .
and if that wasn 't good enough motivation for everyone out there , they also have more -- how shall i say this on this stage ? -- they know each other more in the biblical sense as well .
message number three : don 't leave before you leave .
i think there 's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking -- and i see this all the time -- with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving .
here 's what happens : we 're all busy . everyone 's busy . a woman 's busy .
and she starts thinking about having a child ,
and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child , she starts thinking about making room for that child .
" how am i going to fit this into everything else i 'm doing ? "
and literally from that moment , she doesn 't raise her hand anymore , she doesn 't look for a promotion , she doesn 't take on the new project , she doesn 't say , " me . i want to do that . "
she starts leaning back .
the problem is that -- let 's say she got pregnant that day , that day -- nine months of pregnancy , three months of maternity leave , six months to catch your breath -- fast-forward two years , more often -- and as i 've seen it -- women start thinking about this way earlier -- when they get engaged , when they get married , when they start thinking about trying to have a child , which can take a long time .
one woman came to see me about this , and i kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young .
and i said , " so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby ? "
and she said , " oh no , i 'm not married . "
she didn 't even have a boyfriend .
i said , " you 're thinking about this just way too early . "
but the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back ?
everyone who 's been through this -- and i 'm here to tell you , once you have a child at home , your job better be really good to go back , because it 's hard to leave that kid at home -- your job needs to be challenging .
it needs to be rewarding .
you need to feel like you 're making a difference .
and if two years ago you didn 't take a promotion and some guy next to you did , if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities , you 're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal .
don 't leave before you leave .
stay in .
keep your foot on the gas pedal , until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child -- and then make your decisions .
don 't make decisions too far in advance , particularly ones you 're not even conscious you 're making .
my generation really , sadly , is not going to change the numbers at the top .
they 're just not moving .
we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of [ women ] at the top of any industry .
but i 'm hopeful that future generations can .
i think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women , would be a better world .
and it 's not just because people would know where the women 's bathrooms are , even though that would be very helpful .
i think it would be a better world .
i have two children .
i have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter .
i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home , and i want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed , but to be liked for her accomplishments .
thank you .

thomas goetz : it 's time to redesign medical data
i 'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care , which is the patient , or , as i like to use the scientific term , people .
because we are all patients , we are all people .
even doctors are patients at some point .
so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and , in fact , worldwide .
if you want to get at the big part -- i mean from a public health level , where my training is -- you 're looking at behavioral issues . you 're looking at things where people are actually given information , and they 're not following through with it .
it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes , obesity , many forms of heart disease , even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking .
those are all behaviors where people know what they 're supposed to do .
they know what they 're supposed to be doing ,
but they 're not doing it .
now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine .
it goes all the way back to aristotle .
and doctors hate it , right ?
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance . when people don 't take their pills , when people don 't follow doctors ' orders --
these are behavior problems .
but for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change , there 's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem .
so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn 't just educate them or inform them , but actually leads them to make better decisions , better choices in their lives .
one part of medicine , though , has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well , and that 's dentistry .
dentistry might seem -- and i think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it 's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine .
not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
but they have really taken this problem of behavior change
and solved it .
it 's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system .
people brush and floss their teeth .
they don 't do it as much as they should , but they do it .
so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
so this is an old experiment , but it 's a really good one , because it was very simple , so it 's an easy story to tell .
so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often ,
and they were going to use one variable : they wanted to scare them .
they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn 't brush and floss their teeth .
they had a big patient population .
they divided them up into two groups .
they had a low-fear population , where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation , all based in science , but told them that , if you didn 't brush and floss your teeth , you could get gum disease . if you get gum disease , you will lose your teeth , but you 'll get dentures , and it won 't be that bad .
so that was the low-fear group .
the high-fear group , they laid it on really thick .
they showed bloody gums . they showed puss oozing out from between their teeth . they told them that their teeth were going to fall out . they said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies , and ultimately , yes , they would lose their teeth .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren 't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you weren 't going to be able to eat apples , you weren 't going to be able to eat steak . you 'll eat mush for the rest of your life .
so go brush and floss your teeth .
that was the message . that was the experiment .
now they measured one other variable .
they wanted to capture one other variable , which was the patients ' sense of efficacy .
this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth .
so they asked them at the beginning , " do you think you 'll actually be able to stick with this program ? "
and the people who said , " yeah , yeah . i 'm pretty good about that , " they were characterized as high efficacy , and the people who said , " eh , i never get around to brushing and flossing as much as i should , " they were characterized as low efficacy .
so the upshot was this .
the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver the people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen -- it 's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior .
so fear showed up as not really the driver . it was the sense of efficacy .
so i want to isolate this , because it was a great observation -- 30 years ago , right , 30 years ago -- and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research . it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work , who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
in health care terms , you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health , that they can actually see their way towards getting better health ,
and that 's a very important notion .
it 's an amazing notion .
we don 't really know how to manipulate it , though , that well .
except , maybe we do .
so fear doesn 't work , right ? fear doesn 't work .
and this is a great example of how we haven 't learned that lesson at all .
this is a campaign from the american diabetes association .
this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health .
i mean , i showed my three-year-old this slide last night , and he 's like , " papa , why is an ambulance in these people 's homes ? "
and i had to explain , " they 're trying to scare people . "
and i don 't know if it works .
now here 's what does work : personalized information works .
again , bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
when you give people specific information about their health , where they stand , and where they want to get to , where they might get to , that path , that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change .
so let me just spool it out a little bit .
so you start with personalized data , personalized information that comes from an individual , and then you need to connect it to their lives .
you need to connect it to their lives , hopefully not in a fear-based way , but one that they understand .
okay , i know where i sit . i know where i 'm situated .
and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we 're inundated with . but it actually hits home .
it 's not just hitting us in our heads ; it 's hitting us in our hearts .
there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us .
that information then needs to be connected to choices , needs to be connected to a range of options , directions that we might go to -- trade-offs , benefits .
finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
we need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change .
but the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there -- personalized data , it 's been pretty hard to come by .
it 's a difficult and expensive commodity , until now .
so i 'm going to give you an example , a very simple example of how this works .
so we 've all seen these . these are the " your speed limit " signs .
you 've seen them all around , especially these days as radars are cheaper .
and here 's how they work in the feedback loop .
so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 , and , of course , you 're going faster than that .
we always are . we 're always going above the speed limit .
the choice in this case is pretty simple .
we either keep going fast , or we slow down .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
we should take our foot off the pedal right now ,
and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
they reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
they last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal . but it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
maybe there 's fewer accidents , so there 's public health benefits .
but by and large , this is a feedback loop that 's so nifty and too rare .
because in health care , most health care , the data is very removed from the action .
it 's very difficult to line things up so neatly .
but we have an opportunity .
so i want to talk about , i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
actually , it 's a spoof . it 's not a real pharmaceutical ad .
nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet .
but it looks completely right .
so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information , and it just sounds perfect .
and then we turn the page of the magazine , and we see this --
now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads , or to follow their ads ,
and to me , this is one of the cynical exercises in medicine .
because we know .
who among us would actually say that people read this ?
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?
this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information .
there is no good faith in this .
so this is a different approach .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
and they created this thing called the " drug facts box . "
they took inspiration from , of all things , cap 'n crunch .
they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal , works for our food , actually helps people understand what 's in their food .
god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap 'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
so let me just walk through this quickly .
it says very clearly what the drug is for , specifically who it is good for , so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you .
you can understand exactly what the benefits are .
it isn 't this kind of vague promise that it 's going to work no matter what , but you get the statistics for how effective it is .
and finally , you understand what those choices are .
you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects .
every time you take a drug , you 're walking into a possible side effect .
so it spells those out in very clean terms ,
and that works .
so i love this . i love that drug facts box .
and so i was thinking about , what 's an opportunity that i could have to help people understand information ?
what 's another latent body of information that 's out there that people are really not putting to use ?
and so i came up with this : lab test results .
blood test results are this great source of information .
they 're packed with information .
they 're just not for us . they 're not for people . they 're not for patients .
they go right to doctors .
and god forbid -- i think many doctors , if you really asked them , they don 't really understand all this stuff either .
this is the worst presented information .
you ask tufte , and he would say , " yes , this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible . "
what we did at wired was we went , and i got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports .
so that 's what i want to walk you through .
so this is the general blood work before , and this is the after , this is what we came up with .
the after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that 's just the general blood work .
it goes on and on and on , all these values , all these numbers you don 't know .
this is our one-page summary .
we use the notion of color .
it 's an amazing notion that color could be used .
so on the top-level you have your overall results , the things that might jump out at you from the fine print .
then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context , and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls .
in this case , this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level .
likewise , you can go over your lipids and , again , understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose .
but again , always using color and personalized proximity to that information .
all those other values , all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing , we summarize .
we tell you that you 're okay , you 're normal .
but you don 't have to wade through it . you don 't have to go through the junk .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop :
we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate .
and then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do .
we give them some insight into what choices they can make , what actions they can take .
so that 's our general blood work test .
then we went to crp test .
in this case , it 's a sin of omission .
they have this huge amount of space , and they don 't use it for anything , so we do .
now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test , or in conjunction with a cholesterol test .
so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page , which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
it 's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed , which might be a risk for heart disease .
what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
then we use the information that 's already in the lab report .
we use the person 's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks .
so we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is .
the last one i 'll show you is a psa test .
here 's the before , and here 's the after .
now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know , a psa test is a very controversial test .
it 's used to test for prostate cancer , but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged .
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
we again personalized the risks .
so this patient is in their 50s , so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is .
in this case it 's about 25 percent , based on that .
and then again , the follow-up actions .
so our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars , all right .
that 's what wired magazine spent on this .
why is wired magazine doing this ?
quest diagnostics and labcorp , the two largest lab testing companies -- last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively .
now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of incentives .
we need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor , should not be the insurance company . it should be the patient .
it 's the person who actually , in the end , is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
it 's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
but we 're not using it . it 's just sitting there .
it 's being lost .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i don 't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
but you can create your own feedback loop .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
and the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
what does this mean ? help me understand what the data is .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
and then , what 's next ?
how do i integrate this information into the longer course of my life ?
so i want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information .
this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
you do not need to have the education level of people in this room .
ordinary people are capable of understanding this information , if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with .
and engagement is essential here , because it 's not just giving them information ; it 's giving them an opportunity to act .
that 's what engagement is . it 's different from compliance .
it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today .
and this information is out there .
i 've been talking today about latent information , all this information that exists in the system that we 're not putting to use .
but there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online ,
and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people , to help people and to change the course of their lives .
thank you very much .

sirena huang dazzles on violin
hi everyone . i 'm sirena .
i 'm 11 years old and from connecticut .
well , i 'm not really sure why i 'm here .
i mean , what does this have to do with technology , entertainment and design ?
well , i count my ipod , cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that .
so i did a little research on it .
well , this is what i found .
of course , i hope i can memorize it .
the violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings .
by playing the string , the string vibrates
and produces a sound wave .
sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think . okay . on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length , that changes the frequency of the sound wave .
oh , my gosh !
okay . this is sort of a technology but i can call it a 16th-century technology . but actually , the most fascinating thing that i found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound .
isn 't that cool ?
design -- i love its design .
i remember when i was little my mom asked me , would you like to play the violin or the piano ?
i looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- i am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day .
this is small and lightweight . i can play from standing , sitting or walking .
and you know what ?
the best of all is that if i don 't want to practice , i can hide it .
the violin is very beautiful .
some people relate it as the shape of a lady but , whether you like it or not , it 's been so for more than 400 years , unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated .
but i think it 's very personal and unique that , although each violin looks pretty similar , that no two violins sound the same .
even from the same maker or based on the same model .
entertainment -- i love the entertainment , but actually , the instrument itself isn 't very entertaining .
i mean , when i first got my violin and tried to play around , it was actually , really bad because it didn 't sound like the way i 'd heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it wasn 't entertaining at all .
but besides , my brother found this very funny .
yuk , yuk , yuk .
a few years later i heard a joke about the greatest violinist , jascha heifetz . after mr. heifetz 's concert a lady came over and complimented , " oh , mr. heifetz , your violin sounded so great tonight . "
and mr. heifetz was a very cool person , so he picked up his violin and said , " funny , i don 't hear anything . "
and now , i realize that as the musician , we human beings , we have a great mind , artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment . now , i know why i 'm here .
at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform , but unexpectedly , i learned and enjoyed much more .
but ... although some of them were quite up there for me .
like the multi-dimension stuff .
i mean , honestly , i 'd be happy enough if i can actually get my two dimension correct in school .
but actually , the most impressive thing to me is that ... well , actually , i would also like to stand this for all children is to say , thank you , to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better .
thank you .

michael pollan gives a plant 's-eye view
it 's a simple idea about nature . i want to say a word for nature because we haven 't talked that much about it the last couple days .
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals , and tell you about a tool , a very simple tool that i have found .
although it 's really nothing more than a literary conceit ; it 's not a technology . it 's very powerful for , i think , changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend .
and that tool is very simply , as chris suggested , looking at us and the world from the plants ' or the animals ' point of view .
it 's not my idea , other people have hit on it , but i 've tried to take it to some new places .
let me tell you where i got it .
like a lot of my ideas , like a lot of the tools i use , i found it in the garden ; i 'm a very devoted gardener .
and there was a day about seven years ago : i was planting potatoes ,
it was the first week of may --
this is new england , when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom ;
they 're just white clouds above .
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it ,
and the bees were working on this tree ;
bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate . and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn 't take all your concentration ,
you really can 't get hurt -- it 's not like woodworking --
and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
and the question i asked myself that afternoon in the garden , working alongside that bumblebee , was : what did i and that bumblebee have in common ?
how was our role in this garden similar and different ?
and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common :
both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,
and both of us -- probably , if i can imagine the bee 's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots .
i had decided what kind of potato i wanted to plant --
i had picked my yukon gold or yellow finn , or whatever it was --
and i had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country , brought it , and i was planting it .
and that bee , no doubt , assumed that it had decided , " i 'm going for that apple tree , i 'm going for that blossom , i 'm going to get the nectar and i 'm going to leave . "
we have a grammar that suggests that 's who we are ; that we are sovereign subjects in nature , the bee as well as me .
i plant the potatoes , i weed the garden , i domesticate the species .
but that day , it occurred to me : what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit ?
because , of course , the bee thinks he 's in charge or she 's in charge ,
but we know better .
we know that what 's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower .
and when i say manipulated , i 'm talking about in a darwinian sense , right ?
i mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits -- color , scent , flavor , pattern -- that has lured that bee in .
and the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar , and also picking up some powder on its leg ,
and going off to the next blossom .
the bee is not calling the shots .
and i realized then , i wasn 't either .
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes , giving it a little bit more habitat .
and that 's when i got the idea , which was , " well , what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ? "
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention , not as a human technology , but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species , mostly edible grasses , had exploited us , figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .
the competition of grasses , right ?
and suddenly everything looked different .
and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience .
i had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture 's boot ,
that they were totalitarian landscapes ,
and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex .
and that 's what the lawn was .
but then i realized , " no , this is exactly what the grasses want us to do .
i 'm a dupe . i 'm a dupe of the lawns , whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees , who they compete with for sunlight . "
and so by getting us to mow the lawn , we keep the trees from coming back , which in new england happens very , very quickly .
so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called " the botany of desire . "
and i realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness , that they like this color and not that color , that they like symmetry --
what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing ?
that a certain kind of potato , a certain kind of drug , a sativa-indica cannabis cross has something to say about us .
and that , wouldn 't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world ?
now , the test of any idea -- i said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us ?
and when you 're talking about nature , which is really my subject as a writer , how does it meet the aldo leopold test ?
which is , does it make us better citizens of the biotic community ?
get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota , rather than its destruction ?
and i would submit that this idea does this .
so , let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way , besides some entertaining insights about human desire .
as an intellectual matter , looking at the world from other species ' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,
which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this darwinian revolution 150 years ago ... ugh . mini-me . we have this intellectual , this darwinian revolution in which , thanks to darwin , we figured out we are just one species among many ;
evolution is working on us the same way it 's working on all the others ;
we are acted upon as well as acting ;
we are really in the fiber , the fabric of life .
but the weird thing is , we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later ;
none of us really believes this .
we are still cartesians -- the children of descartes -- who believe that subjectivity , consciousness , sets us apart ;
that the world is divided into subjects and objects ;
that there is nature on one side , culture on another .
as soon as you start seeing things from the plant 's point of view or the animal 's point of view , you realize that the real literary conceit is that --
is the idea that nature is opposed to culture ,
the idea that consciousness is everything --
and that 's another very important thing it does .
looking at the world from other species ' points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance .
you suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature , human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world .
and it 's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool .
but , you know , there 's a comedian who said , " well , who 's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important ?
well , consciousness . "
so when you look at the plants , you realize that there are other tools and they 're just as interesting .
i 'll give you two examples , also from the garden :
lima beans . you know what a lima bean does when it 's attacked by spider mites ?
it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite , defending the lima bean .
so what plants have -- while we have consciousness , tool making , language , they have biochemistry .
and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine .
their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at ,
and i think it 's really the scandal of the human genome project .
you know , we went into it thinking , 40,000 or 50,000 human genes
and we came out with only 23,000 .
just to give you grounds for comparison , rice : 35,000 genes .
so who 's the more sophisticated species ?
well , we 're all equally sophisticated .
we 've been evolving just as long , just along different paths .
so , cure for self-importance , way to sort of make us feel the darwinian idea .
and that 's really what i do as a writer , as a storyteller , is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically .
now , the other use of this is practical .
and i 'm going to take you to a farm right now ,
because i used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what i learned , in fact , is that we are all , now , being manipulated by corn .
and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today , to me , is the final triumph of corn over good sense .
it is part of corn 's scheme for world domination .
and you will see , the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we 've decided ethanol is going to help us .
so it helped me understand industrial agriculture , which of course is a cartesian system .
it 's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge , and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want .
let me take you to a very different kind of farm .
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .
i went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species ' point of view are actually implemented ,
and i found it in a man . the farmer 's name is joel salatin . and i spent a week as an apprentice on his farm ,
and i took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that i 've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature .
and that is this :
the farm is called polyface , which means ... the idea is he 's got six different species of animals , as well as some plants , growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .
it 's permaculture , those of you who know a little bit about this , such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ... what else does he have ?
all the six different species -- rabbits , actually -- are all performing ecological services for one another , such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another .
it 's a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but i 'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it ,
and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens , his laying hens .
and i 'll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , ok ?
and this is a lot more than growing food , as you 'll see ;
this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion , the cartesian idea that either nature 's winning or we 're winning , and that for us to get what we want , nature is diminished .
so , one day , cattle in a pen .
the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing : relatively new , hooked to a car battery ;
even i could carry a quarter-acre paddock , set it up in 15 minutes .
cows graze one day . they move , ok ?
they graze everything down , intensive grazing .
he waits three days ,
and then we towed in something called the eggmobile .
the eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --
it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens .
he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank , turns them down , and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank -- clucking , gossiping as chickens will --
and they make a beeline for the cow patties .
and what they 're doing is very interesting :
they 're digging through the cow patties for the maggots , the grubs , the larvae of flies .
and the reason he 's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those larvae will hatch and he 'll have a huge fly problem .
but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can
because they are the chickens ' favorite form of protein .
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
very useful second ecosystem service .
and third , while they 're in this paddock they are , of course , defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field .
they then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the grass just enters this blaze of growth . and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
he can graze again , he can cut , he can bring in another species , like the lambs , or he can make hay for the winter .
now , i want you to just look really close up onto what 's happened there .
so , it 's a very productive system .
and what i need to tell you is that on 100 acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef ; 30,000 pounds of pork ; 25,000 dozen eggs ; 20,000 broilers ; 1,000 turkeys ; 1,000 rabbits -- an immense amount of food .
you know , you hear , " can organic feed the world ? "
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ... again , give each species what it wants ,
let it realize its desires , its physiological distinctiveness .
put that in play .
but look at it from the point of view of the grass , now .
what happens to the grass when you do this ?
when a ruminant grazes grass , the grass is cut from this height to this height ,
and it immediately does something very interesting .
any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio ,
and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy .
so when they lose a lot of leaf mass , they shed roots ;
they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .
and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots , decomposing them -- the earthworms , the fungi , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .
this is how soil is created .
it 's created from the bottom up .
this is how the prairies were built , the relationship between bison and grasses .
and what i realized when i understood this -- and if you ask joel salatin what he is , he 'll tell you he 's not a chicken farmer , he 's not a sheep farmer , he 's not a cattle rancher ; he 's a grass farmer , because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that , if you think about it , this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads , which is that for us to get what we want , nature is diminished .
more for us , less for nature .
here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
it 's a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
there are a lot of farmers doing this today .
this is well beyond organic agriculture , which is still a cartesian system , more or less .
and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species , take account of the soil , that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences , which are so cheap they could be all over africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process .
this is a way to reanimate the world ,
and that 's what 's so exciting about this perspective .
when we really begin to feel darwin 's insights in our bones , the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about .
thank you very much .

john maeda : how art , technology and design inform creative leaders
i have to say that i 'm very glad to be here .
i understand we have over 80 countries here , so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries .
in each country , i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference .
do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
not the ones for your kids , but the one you had as a child , where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents , and it 's a little bit awkward .
well , i remember in third grade , i had this moment where my father , who never takes off from work , he 's a classical blue collar , a working-class immigrant person , going to school to see his son , how he 's doing , and the teacher said to him , he said , " you know , john is good at math and art . "
and he kind of nodded , you know ?
the next day i saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store , and he said , " you know , john 's good at math . "
and that always stuck with me all my life .
why didn 't dad say art ? why wasn 't it okay ?
why ? it became a question my entire life , and that 's all right , because being good at math meant he bought me a computer , and some of you remember this computer , this was my first computer .
who had an apple ii ? apple ii users , very cool .
as you remember , the apple ii did nothing at all .
you 'd plug it in , you 'd type in it and green text would come out .
it would say you 're wrong most of the time .
that was the computer we knew .
that computer is a computer that i learned about going to mit , my father 's dream . and at mit , however , i learned about the computer at all levels , and after , i went to art school to get away from computers , and i began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking .
and i was influenced by performance art --
so this is 20 years ago . i made a computer out of people .
it was called the human powered computer experiment .
i have a power manager , mouse driver , memory , etc . , and i built this in kyoto , the old capital of japan .
it 's a room broken in two halves .
i 've turned the computer on , and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard , and it 's put into the computer .
and the floppy disk drive person wears it .
she finds the first sector on the disk , and takes data off the disk and passes it off to , of course , the bus .
so the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory , to the cpu , the vram , etc . , and it 's an actual working computer . that 's a bus , really .
and it looks kind of fast . that 's a mouse driver , where it 's xy .
it looks like it 's happening kind of quickly , but it 's actually a very slow computer , and when i realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is , it made me wonder about computers and technology in general .
and so i 'm going to talk today about four things , really .
the first three things are about how i 've been curious about technology , design and art , and how they intersect , how they overlap , and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president and i 'll talk about how i 've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis , a kind of experiment .
so starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
when that apple ii came out , it really could do nothing .
it could show text and after we waited a bit , we had these things called images .
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
and then after a few years , we got cd-quality sound .
it was incredible . you could listen to sound on the computer .
and then movies , via cd-rom . it was amazing .
remember that excitement ?
and then the browser appeared . the browser was great , but the browser was very primitive , very narrow bandwidth .
text first , then images , we waited , cd-quality sound over the net , then movies over the internet . kind of incredible .
and then the mobile phone occurred , text , images , audio , video . and now we have iphone , ipad , android , with text , video , audio , etc .
you see this little pattern here ?
we 're kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson .
designers talk about the relationship between form and content , content and form . now what does that mean ?
well , content is the word up there : fear . it 's a four-letter word . it 's a kind of a bad feeling word , fear .
fear is set in light helvetica , so it 's not too stressful , and if you set it in ultra light helvetica , it 's like , " oh , fear , who cares ? " right ?
you take the same ultra light helvetica and make it big , and like , whoa , that hurts . fear .
so you can see how you change the scale , you change
the form . content is the same , but you feel differently .
you change the typeface to , like , this typeface , and it 's kind of funny . it 's like pirate typeface , like captain jack sparrow typeface . arr ! fear !
like , aww , that 's not fearful . that 's actually funny .
or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface . like , we gotta go to fear .
it 's , like , amazing , right ?
it just changes the same content .
or you make it -- the letters are separated apart , they 're huddled together like on the deck of the titanic , and you feel sorry for the letters , like , i feel the fear .
you feel for them .
or you change the typeface to something like this .
it 's very classy . it 's like that expensive restaurant , fear .
i can never get in there .
it 's just amazing , fear . but that 's form , content .
if you just change one letter in that content , you get a much better word , much better content : free .
" free " is a great word . you can serve it almost any way .
free bold feels like mandela free .
it 's like , yes , i can be free .
free even light feels kind of like , ah , i can breathe in free .
it feels great . or even free spread out , it 's like , ah , i can breathe in free , so easily .
and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove , and i have , like , don draper free .
so you see that -- form , content , design , it works that way .
it 's a powerful thing . it 's like magic , almost , like the magicians we 've seen at ted . it 's magic .
design does that .
and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect , and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore , to give you a sense of what i used to do .
so -- yeah .
so i made a lot of work in the ' 90s .
this was a square that responds to sound .
people ask me why i made that . it 's not clear .
but i thought it 'd be neat for the square to respond to me , and my kids were small then , and my kids would play with these things , like , " aaah , " you know , they would say , " daddy , aaah , aaah . " you know , like that .
we 'd go to a computer store , and they 'd do the same thing .
and they 'd say , " daddy , why doesn 't the computer respond to sound ? " and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesn 't the computer respond to sound ?
so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time .
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this , and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself , so i had to hang up my mouse .
but in ' 96 , i made my last piece . it was in black and white , monochrome , fully monochrome , all in integer mathematics .
it 's called " tap , type , write . "
it 's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary .
it has 10 variations .
there 's a shift .
ten variations . this is , like , spin the letter around .
this is , like , a ring of letters .
this is 20 years old , so it 's kind of a --
let 's see , this is -
i love the french film " the red balloon . "
great movie , right ? i love that movie . so ,
this is sort of like a play on that .
it 's peaceful , like that .
i 'll show this last one . this is about balance , you know .
it 's kind of stressful typing out , so if you type on this keyboard , you can , like , balance it out .
if you hit g , life 's okay , so i always say , " hit g , and it 's going to be all right .
thank you .
thank you .
so that was 20 years ago , and i was always on the periphery of art .
by being president of risd i 've gone deep into art , and art is a wonderful thing , fine art , pure art .
you know , when people say , " i don 't get art . i don 't get it at all . " that means art is working , you know ?
it 's like , art is supposed to be enigmatic , so when you say , like , " i don 't get it , " like , oh , that 's great .
art does that , because art is about asking questions , questions that may not be answerable .
at risd , we have this amazing facility called the edna lawrence nature lab . it has 80,000 samples of animal , bone , mineral , plants .
you know , in rhode island , if an animal gets hit on the road , they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it .
and why do we have this facility ?
because at risd , you have to look at the actual animal , the object , to understand its volume , to perceive it .
at risd , you 're not allowed to draw from an image .
and many people ask me , john , couldn 't you just
digitize all this ? make it all digital ? wouldn 't it be better ?
and i often say , well , there 's something good to how things
used to be done . there 's something very different about it , something we should figure out what is good about how we did it , even in this new era .
and i have a good friend , he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa . he 's based in london , no , actually it 's in tokyo , but when he was based in london , he had a game
with his wife . he would go to antique shops , and the game was as such : when we look at an antique we want , we 'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique , and if it 's a good story , we 'll buy it .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " tell us about this cup . "
and the shopkeeper would say , " it 's old . "
" tell us more . " " oh , it 's really old . "
and he saw , over and over , the antique 's value was all about it being old .
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , i 've spent my whole career making new media art .
people say , " wow , your art , what is it ? " it 's new media .
and he realized , it isn 't about old or new .
it 's about something in between .
it isn 't about " old , " the dirt , " new , " the cloud . it 's about what is good .
a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at .
you see it in all interesting art today , in all interesting businesses today . how we combine
those two together to make good is very interesting .
so art makes questions , and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions .
we aren 't functioning so easily anymore .
we aren 't a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
as an example of authoritarianism , i was in russia one time traveling in st. petersburg , at a national monument , and i saw this sign that says , " do not walk on the grass , " and i thought , oh , i mean , i speak english , and you 're trying to single me out . that 's not fair .
but i found a sign for russian-speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
it was like , " no swimming , no hiking , no anything . "
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? i 'm not sure . and also " no love . "
so that is authoritarianism .
and what is that , structurally ?
it 's a hierarchy . we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it 's been disrupted .
it is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
it 's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy . and that 's kind of awkward .
and so today , leaders are faced with how to lead differently , i believe .
this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont on creative leadership . what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead ?
because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
someone who 's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
a traditional leader is always wanting to be right , whereas a creative leader hopes to be right .
and this frame is important today , in this complex , ambiguous space , and artists and designers have a lot to teach us , i believe .
and i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox , and i said great .
and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight , six hours every day , six-minute appointments with anyone in london , and that was really bad .
but i would listen to people , hear their issues , draw in the sand , try to figure things out , and it was kind of hard to figure out what i was doing .
you know ? it 's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days .
and it felt kind of like being president , actually .
i was like , " oh , this my job . president . i do a lot of meetings , you know ? "
and by the end of the experience , i realized why i was doing this .
it 's because leaders , what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen , and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london , and so leadership , connecting people , is the great question today .
whether you 're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it 's a wonderful design challenge .
and one thing i 've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective .
let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere , actually .
so what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch i wrote in python . you know how there 's photoshop ?
this is called powershop , and the way it works is imagine an organization . you know , the ceo isn 't ever
at the top . the ceo 's at the center of the organization .
there may be different subdivisions in the organization , and you might want to look into different areas . for instance ,
green are areas doing well , red are areas doing poorly .
you know , how do you , as the leader , scan , connect , make things happen ? so for instance , you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there , and know that you know someone in eco , over here , and these people here are in eco , the people you might engage with as ceo , people going across the hierarchy .
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas , and so you might look in r & d , and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest , and it 's a person important to engage .
so you might want to , for instance , get a heads-up display on how you 're interacting with them .
how many coffees do you have ?
how often are you calling them , emailing them ?
what is the tenor of their email ? how is it working out ?
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy .
you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso , the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep
text analysis . what is the tenor of your communications ?
so these kind of systems , i believe , are important .
they 're targeted social media systems around leaders .
and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design , because art and design lets you think like this , find different systems like this ,
and i 've just begun thinking like this , so i 'm glad to share that with you .
so in closing , i want to thank all of you
for your attention . thanks very much .

sergey brin and larry page on google
sergey brin : i want to discuss a question
i know that 's been pressing on many of your minds .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
and before i get started today , since many of you are wondering , i just wanted to get it out of the way .
the answer is boxers .
now i hope all of you feel better .
do you know what this might be ? does anyone know what that is ?
audience : yes .
sb : what is it ?
audience : it 's people logging on to google around the world .
sb : wow , ok . i didn 't really realize what it was when i first saw it .
but this is what helped me see it .
this is what we run at the office , that actually runs real time .
here it 's slightly logged .
but here you can see around the world how people are using google .
and every one of those rising dots represents probably about 20 , 30 searches , or something like that .
and they 're labeled by color right now , by language .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they 're all coming up red .
there we are in monterey -- hopefully i can get it right .
you can see that japan is busy at night , right there .
we have tokyo coming in in japanese .
there 's a lot of activity in china .
there 's a lot of activity in india .
there 's some in the middle east , the little pockets .
and europe , which is right now in the middle of the day , is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages .
now you can also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i won 't shake the world too much .
but you can also see , there are places where there 's not so much .
australia , because there just aren 't very many people there .
and this is something that we should really work on , which is africa , which is just a few trickles , basically in south africa and a few other urban cities .
but basically , what we 've noticed is these queries , which come in at thousands per second , are available everywhere there is power .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
and even in antarctica -- well , at least this time of year -- we from time to time will see a query rising up .
and if we had it plotted correctly , i think the international space station would have it , too .
so this is some of the challenge that we have here , is you can see that it 's actually kind of hard to get the --
there we go .
this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions .
you can see that there 's a lot of data running around .
it has to go all over the world : through fibers , through satellites , through all kinds of connections .
and it 's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to . hopefully your experience is good .
but you can see also , once again -- so some places are much more wired than others , and you can see all the bandwidth across the u.s. , going up over to asia , europe in the other direction , and so forth .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
and if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go .
so this is slowed down .
this is what one second looks like .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , with this kind of traffic load .
now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own .
i mean , it could be somebody 's health , it could be somebody 's career , something important to them .
and it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce , or in this case , ketchup .
so this is a query that we had -- i guess it 's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others .
you can see that it got started right here .
in the u.s. and spain , it was popular at the same time .
but it didn 't have quite the same pickup in the u.s. as it did in spain .
and then from spain , it went to italy , and then germany got excited , and maybe right now the u.k. is enjoying it .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
and i just wanted to play it for you .
anyway , you can all enjoy it for yourselves -- hopefully that search will work .
as a part of -- is to have more searches .
and what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated .
more animals , if they start doing searches as well .
but partly , we want to make the world a better place , and so one thing that we 're embarking upon is the google foundation , and we 're in the process of setting that up .
we also have a program already called google grants that now serves over 150 different charities around the world , and these are some of the charities that are on there .
and it 's something i 'm very excited to be a part of .
in fact , many of the organizations that are here -- the acumen fund , i think approtec we have running , i 'm not sure if that one 's up yet -- and many of the people who have presented here are running through google grants .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
one of the earlier results that we got -- we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 vietnamese girls for their education , and that was one of the earliest results . and as i said , now there have been many , many stories that have come in ,
because we do have hundreds of charities in there , and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor .
now does anybody know who this is ?
a-ha !
audience : orkut . sb : yes ! somebody got it .
this is orkut . is anybody here on orkut ?
do we have any ?
okay , not very many people know about it .
i 'll explain it in a second .
this is one of our engineers .
we find that they work better when they 're submerged and covered with leaves .
that 's how we churn those products out .
orkut had a vision to create a social network .
i know all of you are thinking , " yet another social network . "
but it was a dream of his , and we , basically , when people really want to do something , well , we generally let them .
so this is what he built .
we just released it in a test phase last month , and it 's been taking off .
this is our vp of engineering .
you can see the red hair , and i don 't know if you can see the nose ring there .
and these are all of his friends .
so this is how -- we just deployed it -- we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service , and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out .
and now we 've grown to over 100,000 members . and they spread , actually , very quickly , even outside the u.s .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , search-wise , it 's only about 30 percent of our traffic --
but it 's already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
so it 's a fun little project .
there are a variety of demographics . i won 't bore you with these .
but it 's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes .
and --
well , i 'll leave you in suspense .
larry , you can explain this one .
larry page : thank you , sergey .
so one of the things -- both sergey and i went to a montessori school , and i think , for some reason , this has been incorporated in google .
and sergey mentioned orkut , which is something that , you know , orkut wanted to do in his time ,
and we call this -- at google , we 've embodied this as " the 20 percent time , "
and the idea is , for 20 percent of your time , if you 're working at google , you can do what you think is the best thing to do .
and many , many things at google have come out of that ,
such as orkut and also google news .
and i think many other things in the world also have come out of this .
mendel , who was supposed to be teaching high-school students , actually , you know , discovered the laws of genetics -- as a hobby , basically .
so many , many useful things come out of this .
and news , which i just mentioned , was started by a researcher . and he just -- he -- after 9 / 11 , he got really interested in the news .
and he said , " why don 't i look at the news better ? "
and so he started clustering it by category , and then he started using it , and then his friends started using it .
and then , besides just looking cute on a baby 's bottom , we made it a googlette , which is basically a small project at google .
so it 'd be like three people , or something like that , and they would try to make a product .
and we wouldn 't really be sure if it 's going to work or not .
and in news ' case , you know , they had a couple of people working on it for a while , and then more and more people started using it , and then we put it out on the internet , and more and more people started using it .
and now it 's a real , full-blown project with more people on it .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
and we had this problem , too , for a while , and we said , " oh , we really need a new concept . "
you know , the googlettes -- that 's a small project that we 're not quite sure if it 's going to work or not ,
but we hope it will , and if we do enough of them , some of them will really work and turn out , such as news .
but then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects .
and i don 't know about all of you , but i have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once .
and we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up .
don 't really pay attention to them .
for example , the " buy iceland " was from a media article .
we would never do such a crazy thing , but --
in any case , we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them , that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be .
and this was kind of a surprise to me , but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head , which you did by writing them down , that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .
and so that 's basically what we 've done since we instituted that a few years ago , and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized .
the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important , and so naturally , people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities .
i just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new , or you might not know about .
and the top thing , actually , is the deskbar .
so this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar ?
raise your hands .
how many of you use the deskbar ?
all right , see ? you guys should try it out .
but if you go to our site and search for " deskbar , " you 'll get this .
and the idea is , instead of a toolbar , it 's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom , and you can do searches really easily .
and it 's sort of like a better version of the toolbar .
thank you , sergey .
this is another example of a project that somebody at google was really passionate about , and they just , they got going , and it 's really , really a great product , and really taking off .
google answers is something we started , which is really cool , which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there 's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you , and it 's guaranteed and all that , and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself .
froogle lets you search shopping information , and blogger lets you publish things .
but all of these -- well , these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --
you know , we try many , many different things in our company .
we also like to innovate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off ,
and they 're noisy , so people shut them off .
and we didn 't like that , so we actually , in maybe a couple of weeks , we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors , and so we can leave them on all the time and they 're completely silent .
and as a result , we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting ,
so when you walk into a meeting room now , it lists all the meetings that are happening , you can very easily take notes , and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting .
and as we become more of a global company , we find these things really affect us --
you know , can we work effectively with people who aren 't in the room ?
and things like that . and simple things like this can really make a big difference .
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should .
and so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines , for our younger employees especially , and ...
we also allow dogs and things like that ,
and we 've had , i think , a really fun culture at our company , which helps people work and enjoy what they 're doing .
this is actually our " cult picture . "
i just wanted to show quickly .
we had this on our website for a while , but we found that after we put it on our website , we didn 't get any job applications anymore .
but anyway , every year we 've taken the whole company on a ski trip .
a lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other , and informally .
and i think we 've done a good job encouraging that .
it makes it a really fun place to work .
along with our logos , too , which i think really embody our culture when we change things .
in the early days , we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand , you know , because , you know , you 'd never want to change your logo .
you want it to be consistent .
and we said , " well , that doesn 't sound so much fun .
why don 't we try changing it every day ? "
one of the things that really excites me about what we 're doing now is we have this thing called adsense ,
and this is a little bit foreshadowing -- this is from before dean dropped out .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
and this is hard to read , but this says " battle for new hampshire : howard dean for president " -- articles on howard dean .
and these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case , on the washington post -- from the content on the site .
and so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements , so we pick the one that 's most relevant to what you 're actually looking at , much as we do on search .
so the idea is we can make advertising useful , not just annoying , right ?
and the nice thing about this , we have a self-serve program , and many thousands of websites have signed up , and this let 's them really make money . and i --
you know , there 's a number of people i met -- i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party , and he said , " you know , i wasn 't making any money .
i just put this thing on my site and i 'm making 10,000 dollars a month .
i don 't have to do my other job now . "
and i think this is really important for us , because it makes the internet work better .
it makes content get better , it makes searching work better , when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content .
so this session is supposed to be about the future , so i 'd thought i 'd talk at least briefly about it .
and the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search , you really have to be smart .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
but finding things is tricky , and so you really want intelligence .
and in fact , the ultimate search engine would be smart .
it would be artificial intelligence .
and so that 's something we work on ,
and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now , and that 's really their goal .
so we always hope that google will be smart , but we 're always surprised when other people think that it is .
and so i just wanted to give a funny example of this . this is a blog from iraq ,
and it 's not really what i 'm going to talk about , but i just wanted to show you an example .
maybe , sergey , you can highlight this .
so we decided -- actually , the highlight 's right there . oh , thank you .
so , " related searches , " right there . you can 't see it that well ,
but we decided we should put in this feature into our adsense ads , called " related searches . "
and so we 'd say , you know , " did you mean ' search for ' " -- what is this ,
in this case , " saddam hussein , " because this blog is about iraq -- and you know , in addition to the ads , and we thought this would be a great idea .
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed , and he said , " you know , i 'm sleeping a lot . "
he was just kind of writing about his life .
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was , " i am bored . "
and he read this , and he thought a person had decided that he was boring ,
and it was very unfortunate , and he said , " you know , what are these , you know , bastards at google doing ?
why don 't they like my blog ? "
and so then we read his blog , which was getting -- you know , sort of going from bad to worse , and we said the related search was , " retards . "
and then , you know , he got even more mad , and he wrote -- like , started swearing and so on .
and then we produced " you suck . "
and finally , it ended with " kiss my ass . "
and so basically , he thought he was dealing with something smart , and of course , you know , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out ,
and it didn 't quite work ,
and we don 't have this feature anymore .
so with that , maybe i can switch back to the world .
i wanted to end just by saying that there 's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with google ,
and one of those is that we 're able to make money largely through advertising , and one of the benefits that i didn 't expect from that was that we 're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about , you know , places that don 't have as much money .
so we don 't have to worry about our products being sold , for example , for less money in places that are poor , and then they get re-imported into the u.s. -- for example , with the drug industry .
and i think we 're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search , and i think that 's a tremendous , tremendous benefit .
the other thing i wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information ,
and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information .
and so in our search results , we never accept payment for our search results .
we accept payment for advertising , and we mark it as such .
and that 's unlike many of our competitors .
and i think decisions we 're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world , and it makes me really proud to be involved with google .
so thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / seth _ priebatsch _ the _ game _ layer _ on _ top _ of _ the _ world.html
by now , we 're used to letting facebook and twitter capture our social lives on the web -- building a " social layer " on top of the real world . at tedxboston , seth priebatsch looks at the next layer in progress : the " game layer , " a pervasive net of behavior-steering game dynamics that will reshape education and commerce .
business , entertainment , entrepreneur , gaming , money , psychology

seth priebatsch : the game layer on top of the world
my name 's seth priebatsch . i 'm the chief ninja of scvngr .
i am a proud princeton dropout .
also proud to have relocated here to boston , where i actually grew up .
yeah , boston .
easy wins . i should just go and name the counties that we 've got around here .
so , i 'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .
and this is sort of a new concept , and it 's really important .
because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built , this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built , where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior , and the framework in which that is constructed , is decided upon , and that 's really important .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that 's not quite true because it 's already under construction ; it 's already happening .
and it looks like this right now .
it looks like the web did back in 1997 , right ?
it 's not very good . it 's cluttered .
it 's filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren 't that fun .
there are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer : they just suck .
they 're not very well designed , right ?
so , that 's unfortunate .
but luckily , as my favorite action hero , bob the builder , says , " we can do better . we can build this better . " and the tools , the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves .
and so , sort of , the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics , really interesting things , that , if you use consciously , you can use to influence behavior , both for good , for bad , for in-between .
hopefully for good .
but this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built , and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now .
just before we jump into that , there 's sort of a question of : why is this important ?
i 'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world , and that it 's very important that we build it properly .
the reason that it 's so important is that , the last decade , what we 've seen has been building the social layer , has been this framework for connections , and construction on that layer is over , it 's finished .
there 's still a lot to explore .
there 's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this , but the framework itself is done , and it 's called facebook .
and that 's okay , right ? a lot of people are very happy with facebook .
i like it quite a lot .
they 've created this thing called the open graph , and they own all of our connections .
they own half a billion people .
and so when you want to build on the social layer , the framework has been decided ; it is the open graph api .
and if you 're happy with that , fantastic .
if you 're not , too bad . there 's nothing you can do .
but this next decade -- and that 's a real thing .
i mean , we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it , you know , productive down the road .
so , the social layer is all about these connections .
the game layer is all about influence .
it 's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go .
it 's actually about using dynamics , using forces , to influence the behavior of where you are , what you do there , how you do it .
that 's really , really powerful , and it 's going to be more important than the social layer .
it 's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly .
and so it 's incredibly critical that at this moment , while it 's just getting constructed , while the frameworks like facebook , like the open graph , are being created for the game layer equivalent , that we think about it very consciously , and that we do it in a way that is open , that is available , and that can be leveraged for good .
and so that 's what i want to talk about for game dynamics , because construction has just begun , and the more consciously we can think about this , the better we 'll be able to use it for anything that we want .
so like i said , the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement .
and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have .
the resources are mindshare and the tools , the raw materials are these game dynamics .
so with that , you know , a couple game dynamics to talk about .
four . back at scvngr , we like to joke that with seven game dynamics , you can get anyone to do anything .
and so today , i 'm going to show you four , because i hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this , still .
so the first one , it 's a very simple game dynamic .
it 's called the appointment dynamic .
and this is a dynamic in which to succeed , players have to do something at a predefined time , generally at a predefined place .
and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes , because you think , you know , other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact : what i do , where i do it , when i do it .
this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening , so with each dynamic , i 'm going to give three examples : one that shows how this is already being used in the real world , so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit ; one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game -- i think everything is a game , but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen , and then one how this can be used for good , so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful .
so the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
so i just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
and this is simply an appointment dynamic .
come here at a certain time , get your drinks half off .
to win , all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time .
this game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn 't just influence our behavior , it 's influenced our entire culture .
that 's a really scary thought , that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully .
it also exists in more conventional game forms .
i 'm sure you 've all heard of farmville by now .
if you haven 't , i recommend playing it .
you won 't do anything else with the rest of your day .
farmville has more active users than twitter .
it 's incredibly powerful , and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops -- fake crops -- or they wilt .
and this is so powerful that , when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the lifecycle of 70 million-some people during the day .
they will return like clockwork at different times .
so if they wanted the world to end , if they wanted productivity to stop , they could make this a 30-minute cycle , and no one could do anything else , right ?
that 's a little scary .
but this could also be used for good .
this is a local company called vitality , and they 've created a product to help people take their medicine on time .
that 's an appointment .
it 's something that people don 't do very well .
and they have these glowcaps , which , you know , flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine .
this is one that isn 't a game yet , but really should be .
you should get points for doing this on time .
you should lose points for not doing this on time .
they should consciously recognize that they 've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games .
and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways .
we 're going to jump onto the next one , maybe . yes .
influence and status .
so this is one of the most famous game dynamics .
it 's used all over the place .
it 's used in your wallets , right now .
we all want that credit card on the far left because it 's black .
and you see someone at cvs or -- not cvs -- at christian dior or something , and then ... i don 't know . i don 't have a black card ; i 've got a debit card .
so they whip it out . and you see men , they have that black card .
i want that because that means that they 're cooler than i am , and i need that .
and this is used in games as well .
" modern warfare , " one of the most successful selling games of all time .
i 'm only a level four , but i desperately want to be a level 10 , because they 've got that cool red badge thing , and that means that i am somehow better than everyone else .
and that 's very powerful to me . status is really good motivator .
it 's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings .
school -- and remember , i made it through one year , so i think i 'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game , it 's just not a terribly well-designed game , right .
there are levels . there are c. there are b. there is a .
there are statuses . i mean , what is valedictorian , but a status ?
if we called valedictorian a " white knight paladin level 20 , " i think people would probably work a lot harder .
so school is a game , and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly .
but let 's use it consciously . like why have games that you can lose ?
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
that sucks . why not level-up ?
and at princeton , they 've actually experimented with this , where they have quizzes where you gain experience points , and you level up from b to an a .
and it 's very powerful .
it can be used in interesting ways .
the third one i want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic , where you have to sort of make progress , you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion .
this is used all over the place , including linkedin , where i am an un-whole individual .
i am only 85 percent complete on linkedin , and that bothers me .
and this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we 're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy , granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar , we will do it .
we will find a way to move that blue line
all the way to the right edge of the screen .
this is used in conventional games as well .
i mean , you see this is a paladin level 10 , and that 's a paladin level 20 , and if you were going to fight , you know , orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul , you 'd probably want to be the bigger one , right .
i would .
and so people work very hard to level-up .
" world of warcraft " is one of the most successful games of all time .
the average player spends something like six , six-and-a-half hours a day on it .
their most dedicated players , it 's like a full-time job .
it 's insane . and they have these systems where you can level-up .
and that 's a very powerful thing . progression is powerful .
it can also be used in very compelling ways for good .
one of the things that we work on at scvngr is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses , to sort of something that is very key to the economy .
and here we have a game that people play .
they go places , they do challenges , they earn points .
and we 've introduced a progression dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by engaging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually unlock rewards .
and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics , pulls them back to the same local businesses , creates huge loyalty , creates engagement , and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses .
these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world .
the final one i want to talk about -- and it 's a great one to end on -- is this concept of communal discovery , a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something .
and communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems .
this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories , like digg , which i 'm sure you 've all heard of .
digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news , the most interesting stories .
and they made this into a game , initially .
they had a leader board , where , if you recommended the best stories , you would get points .
and that really motivated people to find the best stories .
but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal , a group of people , the top seven on the leader board , who would work together to make sure they maintained that position .
and they would recommend other people 's stories ,
and the game became more powerful than the goal .
and they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective , it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership .
so we have to use this one carefully .
it 's also used in things like mcdonald 's monopoly , where the game is not the monopoly game you 're playing , but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find boardwalk , right .
and now they 're just looking for a little sticker that says " boardwalk . "
but it can also be used to find real things .
this is the darpa balloon challenge , where they hid a couple balloons all across the united states and said , " use networks .
try and find these balloons fastest , and the winner will get $ 40,000 . "
and the winner was actually a group out of mit , where they created sort of a pyramid scheme , a network , where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $ 2,000 and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it .
and in 12 hours , they were able to find all these balloons , all across the country , right .
really powerful dynamic .
and so , i 've got about 20 seconds left , so if i 'm going to leave you with anything , last decade was the decade of social .
this next decade is the decade of games .
we use game dynamics to build on it . we build with mindshare .
we can influence behavior .
it is very powerful . it is very exciting .
let 's all build it together , let 's do it well and have fun playing .

tim brown urges designers to think big
i 'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do ,
something like 25 years ago .
it 's a woodworking machine , or at least a piece of one ,
and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern , a little bit easier to use .
i thought , at the time , i did a pretty good job .
unfortunately , not very long afterwards the company went out of business .
this is the second project that i did . it 's a fax machine .
i put an attractive shell around some new technology .
again , 18 months later , the product was obsolete .
and now , of course , the whole technology is obsolete .
now , i 'm a fairly slow learner ,
but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn 't all that important -- making things more attractive , making them a bit easier to use , making them more marketable .
by focusing on a design , maybe just a single product , i was being incremental and not having much of an impact .
but i think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon , and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism .
so when we talk about design today , and particularly when we read about it in the popular press , we 're often talking about products like these .
amusing ? yes . desirable ? maybe .
important ? not so very .
but this wasn 't always the way .
and i 'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design , and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach , that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact .
now this gentleman , isambard kingdom brunel , designed many great things in his career in the 19th century , including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe .
both great designs and actually very innovative too .
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford .
it 's called the great western railway .
and as a kid i grew up very close to here ,
and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past .
you can see it represented here in j.m.w. turner 's painting , " rain , steam and speed . "
now , what brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
now , this was back in the 19th century .
and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
but he didn 't stop there . he didn 't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey .
he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york .
one journey from london to new york .
this is the s.s. great western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey .
now , brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession ,
but i think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations .
now , design thinking begins with what roger martin , the business school professor at the university of toronto , calls integrative thinking .
and that 's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions .
in the case of design , that means balancing desirability , what humans need , with technical feasibility , and economic viability .
with innovations like the great western , we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit .
so somehow , we went from this to this .
systems thinkers who were reinventing the world , to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things .
as our industrial society matured , so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics , image and fashion .
now i 'm not trying to throw stones here .
i 'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses .
there we go .
but i do think that perhaps design is getting big again .
and that 's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems -- to global warming , to education , healthcare , security , clean water , whatever .
and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful .
and i 'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
the first of those is that design is human-centered .
it may integrate technology and economics , but it starts with what humans need , or might need .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
what makes technology useful and usable ?
but that is more than simply good ergonomics , putting the buttons in the right place .
it 's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas .
so when a team was working on a new vision screening program in india , they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents .
conversion sound has developed a high quality , ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world .
now , in the west we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids .
in places like india , those technicians simply don 't exist .
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .
instead of starting with technology , the team started with people and culture .
so if human need is the place to start , then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
now , prototypes speed up the process of innovation ,
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses .
and the faster we do that , the faster our ideas evolve .
now , much has been said and written about the aravind eye institute in madurai , india .
they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot .
now , they are very efficient , but they are also very innovative .
when i visited them a few years ago , what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early .
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .
they make their own intraocular lenses .
these are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts .
and i think it 's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough .
because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory , they used the basement of one of their hospitals .
and instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost cad / cam prototyping technology .
they are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory .
so if human need is the place to start , and prototyping , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the destination .
instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --
the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and profitable .
so i 'd like to take the idea that rory sutherland talked about , this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things , and take that a little bit further and say that i think the design of participatory systems , in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured , is going to be the major theme , not only for design , but also for our economy as we go forward .
so william beveridge , when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942 , created what became britain 's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being .
by the time he wrote his third report , he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers .
hilary cottam , charlie leadbeater , and hugo manassei of participle have taken this idea of participation , and in their manifesto entitled beveridge 4.0 , they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state .
so in one of their projects called southwark circle , they worked with residents in southwark , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year .
we can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it 's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone .
nurses and practitioners at u.s. healthcare system kaiser permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience ,
and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift .
through a program of observational research , brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping , they 've developed a completely new way to change shift .
they went from retreating to the nurse 's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients , to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients , using a simple software tool .
by doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes , on average .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
and this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .
so these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they 're being applied to .
but i 'd like to go back to brunel here , and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now , and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool .
and that connection is change .
in times of change we need new alternatives , new ideas .
now , brunel worked at the height of the industrial revolution , when all of life and our economy was being reinvented .
now the industrial systems of brunel 's time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
but , again , we are in the midst of massive change .
and that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society -- how we keep ourselves healthy , how we govern ourselves , how we educate ourselves , how we keep ourselves secure .
and in these times of change , we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete .
so why design thinking ?
because it gives us a new way of tackling problems .
instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives , it encourages us to take a divergent approach , to explore new alternatives , new solutions , new ideas that have not existed before .
but before we go through that process of divergence , there is actually quite an important first step .
and that is , what is the question that we 're trying to answer ?
what 's the design brief ?
now brunel may have asked a question like this , " how do i take a train from london to new york ? "
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
so these are some that we 've been asked to think about recently .
and one in particular , is one that we 're working on with the acumen fund , in a project that 's been funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation .
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world 's poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate , we took a sort of more open , collaborative and participative approach .
we teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across india .
and through workshops they developed innovative new products , services , and business models .
we hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas .
so they developed and iterated these ideas .
and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns , community outreach strategies , business models , new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water .
some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market .
and the same process is just getting underway with ngos in east africa .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly , by getting the process out of the hands of designers , and by getting the active participation of the community , we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions .
and just like brunel , by focusing on systems , we can have a bigger impact .
so that 's one thing that we 've been working on .
i 'm actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?
and if you 've got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to twitter .
there is a hash tag there that you can use , # cbdq .
and the list looked something like this a little while ago .
and of course you can search to find the questions that you 're interested in by using the same hash code .
so i 'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest high street products .
to do that i think we have to take a more expansive view of design , more like brunel , less a domain of a professional priesthood .
and the first step is to start asking the right questions .
thank you very much .

sheena iyengar on the art of choosing
today , i 'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes .
my base of operations is in the u.s. , but let 's start at the other end of the map , in kyoto , japan , where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dissertational research 15 years ago .
i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings , but they popped up when i least expected it .
on my first day , i went to a restaurant , and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar .
after a pause , the waiter said , " one does not put sugar in green tea . "
" i know , " i said . " i 'm aware of this custom .
but i really like my tea sweet . " in response , he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation .
" one does not put sugar in green tea . " " i understand , " i said , " that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea ,
but i 'd like to put some sugar in my green tea . " surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
pretty soon , a lengthy discussion ensued , and finally the manager came over to me and said , " i am very sorry . we do not have sugar . "
well , since i couldn 't have my tea the way i wanted it , i ordered a cup of coffee , which the waiter brought over promptly .
resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar .
my failure to procure myself a cup of sweet , green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding .
this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice .
from my american perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
the american way , to quote burger king , is to " have it your way , " because , as starbucks says , " happiness is in your choices . "
but from the japanese perspective , it 's their duty to protect those who don 't know any better -- in this case , the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .
let 's face it : the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards , and they were doing their best to help me save face .
americans tend to believe that they 've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice .
they think that choice , as seen through the american lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans .
unfortunately , these beliefs are based on assumptions that don 't always hold true in many countries , in many cultures .
at times they don 't even hold true at america 's own borders .
i 'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them .
as i do so , i hope you 'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .
first assumption : if a choice affects you , then you should be the one to make it .
this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for .
it is essential for success .
in america , the primary locus of choice is the individual .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
it 's called " being true to yourself . "
but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ?
mark lepper and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question .
in one study , which we ran in japantown , san francisco , we brought seven- to nine-year-old anglo- and asian-american children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
the first group came in , and they were greeted by miss smith , who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles .
the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,
and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with .
when the second group of children came in , they were brought to the same room , shown the same anagrams , but this time miss smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with .
now when the third group came in , they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers .
in reality , the kids who were told what to do , whether by miss smith or their mothers , were actually given the very same activity , which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .
with this procedure , we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance .
such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed .
anglo-americans , they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them , as compared to when it was chosen for them by miss smith or their mothers .
it didn 't matter who did the choosing , if the task was dictated by another , their performance suffered .
in fact , some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .
one girl named mary said , " you asked my mother ? "
in contrast , asian-american children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice , second best when they chose for themselves , and least well when it had been chosen by miss smith .
a girl named natsumi even approached miss smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked , " could you please tell my mommy i did it just like she said ? " the first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents ' approach to choice .
for them , choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality , but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected .
if they had a concept of being true to one 's self , then that self , most likely , [ was ] composed , not of an individual , but of a collective .
success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one 's own preferences .
or , you could say that the individual 's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
when , in contrast , two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected , then they may amplify one another 's success by turning choosing into a collective act .
to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships .
yet that is exactly what the american paradigm demands .
it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility .
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .
people that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating ,
but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone .
the second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like this .
the more choices you have , the more likely you are to make the best choice .
so bring it on , walmart , with 100,000 different products , and amazon , with 27 million books and match.com with -- what is it ? -- 15 million date possibilities now .
you will surely find the perfect match .
let 's test this assumption by heading over to eastern europe .
here , i interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries , who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society .
one of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question , but from a simple gesture of hospitality .
when the participants arrived for their interview , i offered them a set of drinks : coke , diet coke , sprite -- seven , to be exact .
during the very first session , which was run in russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard .
" oh , but it doesn 't matter .
it 's all just soda . that 's just one choice . " i was so struck by this comment that from then on , i started to offer all the participants those seven sodas ,
and i asked them , " how many choices are these ? "
again and again , they perceived these seven different sodas , not as seven choices , but as one choice : soda or no soda .
when i put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas , now they perceived it as only three choices -- juice , water and soda .
compare this to the die-hard devotion of many americans , not just to a particular flavor of soda , but to a particular brand .
you know , research shows repeatedly that we can 't actually tell the difference between coke and pepsi .
of course , you and i know that coke is the better choice .
for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
but for eastern europeans , the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge .
they were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn 't know how to swim .
when asked , " what words and images do you associate with choice ? " grzegorz from warsaw said , " ah , for me it is fear .
there are some dilemmas you see .
i am used to no choice . " bohdan from kiev said , in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace , " it is too much .
we do not need everything that is there . " a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained , " the older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them .
they were never given a chance to learn how to react . " and tomasz , a young polish man said , " i don 't need twenty kinds of chewing gum .
i don 't mean to say that i want no choice , but many of these choices are quite artificial . " in reality , many choices are between things that are not that much different .
the value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options .
americans train their whole lives to play " spot the difference . "
they practice this from such an early age that they 've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability .
in fact , though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice , we don 't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent .
when someone can 't see how one choice is unlike another , or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast , the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating .
instead of making better choices , we become overwhelmed by choice , sometimes even afraid of it .
choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
it 's not a marker of liberation , but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae .
in other words , choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in america when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it .
but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice .
americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice .
we all have physical , mental and emotional limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the grocery store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
a number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they 're making a choice , they make poorer decisions , whether it be health care , investment , other critical areas .
yet still , many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them .
this brings me to the third , and perhaps most problematic , assumption : " you must never say no to choice . " to examine this , let 's go back to the u.s. and then hop across the pond to france .
right outside chicago , a young couple , susan and daniel mitchell , were about to have their first baby .
they 'd already picked out a name for her , barbara , after her grandmother .
one night , when susan was seven months pregnant , she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room .
the baby was delivered through a c-section , but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia , a loss of oxygen to the brain .
unable to breathe on her own , she was put on a ventilator .
two days later , the doctors gave the mitchells a choice :
they could either remove barbara off the life support , in which case she would die within a matter of hours , or they could keep her on life support , in which case she might still die within a matter of days .
if she survived , she would remain in a permanent vegetative state , never able to walk , talk or interact with others .
what do they do ?
what do any parent do ?
in a study i conducted with simona botti and kristina orfali , american and french parents were interviewed .
they had all suffered the same tragedy .
in all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
but there was a big difference .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
we wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
we found that it did .
even up to a year later , american parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their french counterparts .
french parents were more likely to say things like , " noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
he gave us a new perspective on life . " american parents were more likely to say things like , " what if ? what if ? "
another parent complained , " i feel as if they purposefully tortured me .
how did they get me to do that ? " and another parent said , " i feel as if i 've played a role in an execution . " but when the american parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision , they all said , " no . "
they could not imagine turning that choice over to another , even though having made that choice made them feel trapped , guilty , angry .
in a number of cases they were even clinically depressed .
these parents could not contemplate giving up the choice , because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice .
in her essay , " the white album , " joan didion writes , " we tell ourselves stories in order to live .
we interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images , by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria , which is our actual experience . " the story americans tell , the story upon which the american dream depends , is the story of limitless choice .
this narrative promises so much : freedom , happiness , success .
it lays the world at your feet and says , " you can have anything , everything . "
it 's a great story , and it 's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .
but when you take a close look , you start to see the holes , and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways .
americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice , believing that they will be , or ought to be , welcomed with open hearts and minds .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn 't always work out that way .
the phantasmagoria , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative , varies from place to place .
no single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere .
moreover , americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative , which has been driving their choices for so long .
robert frost once said that , " it is poetry that is lost in translation . "
this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving , whatever gives us a new way to see , cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language .
but joseph brodsky said that , " it is poetry that is gained in translation , " suggesting that translation can be a creative , transformative act .
when it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives .
instead of replacing one story with another , we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .
no matter where we 're from and what your narrative is , we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do , and what it can represent . and this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism .
rather , it teaches us when and how to act .
it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice , to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn 't always deliver .
if we learn to speak to one another , albeit through translation , then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness , complexity and compelling beauty .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you .
sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book .
but by now it 's evident to everyone in this room . you 're blind .
and i guess one of the questions on everybody 's mind is : how does that influence your study of choosing because that 's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on ?
sheena iyengar : well , it 's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that 's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices .
and as you just mentioned , there 's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days .
yeah , i -- as you would expect -- get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest .
and i can 't decide .
and so one time i was in a beauty salon , and i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .
and one was called " ballet slippers . "
and the other one was called " adorable . "
and so i asked these two ladies ,
and the one lady told me , " well , you should definitely wear ' ballet slippers . ' "
" well , what does it look like ? "
" well , it 's a very elegant shade of pink . "
" okay , great . "
the other lady tells me to wear " adorable . "
" what does it look like ? "
" it 's a glamorous shade of pink . "
and so i asked them , " well , how do i tell them apart ?
what 's different about them ? " and they said , " well , one is elegant , the other one 's glamorous . "
okay , we got that .
and the only thing they had consensus on : well , if i could see them , i would clearly be able to tell them apart .
and what i wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color ,
so i decided to do a little experiment .
so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory , and i stripped the labels off .
and i brought women into the laboratory , and i asked them , " which one would you pick ? "
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles .
at which point you start to wonder who the trick 's really played on .
now , of the women that could tell them apart , when the labels were off , they picked " adorable , " and when the labels were on , they picked " ballet slippers . "
so as far as i can tell , a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different .
bg : thank you . sheena iyengar . thank you sheena .

peter hirshberg on tv and the web
well , good morning .
you know , the computer and television both recently turned 60 , and today i 'd like to talk about their relationship .
despite their middle age , if you 've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry , it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other .
so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television ,
or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers ' strike .
and it 's not just what these are doing to each other , but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter .
to get a sense of this , and it 's been a theme we 've talked about all week , i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .
i wrote on cards : " television , " " radio , " " myspace , " " internet , " " pc . "
and i said , just arrange these , from what 's important to you and what 's not , and then tell me why .
let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television .
girl 1 : well , i think it 's important but , like , not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs .
peter hirshberg : which is more fun , internet or tv ?
girls : internet .
girl 2 : i think we -- the reasons , one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays , like , we have tv shows on the computer .
girl 2 : and then you can download onto your ipod .
ph : would you like to be the president of a tv network ?
girl 4 : i wouldn 't like it .
girl 2 : that would be so stressful .
girl 5 : no .
ph : how come ?
girl 5 : because they 're going to lose all their money eventually .
girl 3 : like the stock market , it goes up and down and stuff .
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
ph : there 's been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
we go through periods of enthrallment , followed by reactions in boardrooms , in the finance community best characterized as , what 's the finance term ? ick pooey .
let me give you an example of this . the year is 1976 , and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise .
the next year they march forward and they introduce qube , the first interactive cable tv system , and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home , convergence , great things are happening .
everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures -- citicorp , penney , rca -- all getting into this big vision .
by the way , this is about when i enter the picture .
i 'm going to do a summer internship at time warner .
that summer i 'm all -- i 'm at warner that summer -- i 'm all excited to work on convergence , and then the bottom falls out .
doesn 't work out too well for them , they lose money .
and i had a happy brush with convergence until , kind of , warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing .
that 's when i leave graduate school , and i can 't work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california , where the remaining jobs are , almost to the sea , to go to work for apple computer .
warner , of course , writes off more than 400 million dollars .
four hundred million dollars , which was real money back in the ' 70s .
but they were onto something and they got better at it .
by the year 2000 , the process was perfected . they merged with aol , and in just four years , managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization , showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet .
now , i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities , or the media community , is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently .
you know , for 50 years , we 've talked about changing the world , about total transformation .
for 50 years , it 's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world . and i got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ?
and the answer is pretty clearly -- it 's people in religion and in politics .
and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood , not as a business cycle , but as a messianic movement .
we promise something great , we evangelize it , we 're going to change the world . it doesn 't work out too well , and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again , as the people in new york and l.a. look on in absolute , morbid astonishment .
but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing .
so , what i 'd like to ask is , if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment , how did we get here ?
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media ?
of course , the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems , but things got really interesting just a couple of years later -- 1949 with whirlwind ,
built at mit 's lincoln lab . jay forrester was building this for the navy , but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star .
so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers , and the computer begins to express itself .
journalist : it 's a whirlwind electronic computer .
with considerable trepidation , we undertake to interview this new machine .
jay forrester : hello new york , this is cambridge .
and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer .
would you like if i used the machine ?
journalist : yes , of course . but i have an idea , mr. forrester .
since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research , why don 't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy 's research chief , admiral bolster , give whirlwind the workout ?
calvin bolster : well , ed , this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket .
this rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky .
now , at the standard rate of fuel consumption , i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine , at any instant , say at the end of 40 seconds , the amount of fuel remaining , and the velocity at that set instant .
jf : over on the left-hand side , you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off .
and on the right-hand side , there 's a scale that shows the rocket 's velocity .
the rocket 's position is shown by the trajectory that we 're now looking at .
and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory , the velocity , you will notice , has dropped off to a minimum .
then , as the rocket dives down , velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground .
how 's that ?
journalist : what about that , admiral ?
cb : looks very good to me .
jf : and before leaving , we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time , in a less serious vein , for a sunday afternoon .
journalist : thank you very much indeed , mr. forrester and the mit lab .
ph : you know , so much was worked out : the first real-time interaction , the video display , pointing a gun . it lead to the microcomputer , but unfortunately , it was too pricey for the navy , and all of this would have been lost if it weren 't for a happy coincidence .
enter the atomic bomb .
we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system , deploy it all across the frozen north , and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a-bomb in the first place .
talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry .
and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman .
here 's their marketing video .
narrator : in a mass raid , high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks .
and then it would be too late to act .
we cannot afford to take that chance .
it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage , the semi-automatic ground environment system , to strengthen our air defenses .
this new computer , built to become the nerve center of a defense network , is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid .
it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel-driven generators , air-conditioning equipment , and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer .
ph : you know , that one computer was huge .
there 's an interesting marketing lesson from it , which is basically , when you market a product , you can either say , this is going to be wonderful , it will make you feel better and enliven you . or there 's one other marketing proposition : if you don 't use our product , you 'll die .
this is a really good example of that .
this had the first pointing device . it was distributed , so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other .
about 20 percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing , and it led to an awful lot of what we have today . it also used vacuum tubes .
you saw how huge it was , and to give you a sense for this -- because we 've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference , so let 's talk about making things large .
if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know , say , century city , it would fit beautifully .
you 'd kind of have to take century city out , but it could fit in there .
but like , let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor , the latest core 2 extreme , which is a four-core processor that intel 's working on , it will be our laptop tomorrow .
to build that , what we 'd do with whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to mulholland , and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates .
so , the next time they tell you they 're on to something , clearly they 're not .
so -- and we haven 't even worked out the cooling needs .
but it gives you the kind of power that people have , that the audience has , and the reasons these transformations are happening .
all of this stuff starts moving into industry .
dec kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer .
it shows up at places like mit , and then a mutation happens .
spacewar ! is built , the first computer game , and all of a sudden , interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out .
actually , many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing , and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out .
dec knew a good thing about wasting time .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
meanwhile , as all of this is happening , by the mid- ' 50s , the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely .
a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in .
in fact , despair is in the air .
and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week . rca had david sarnoff , who basically commercialized radio , said this , " i don 't say that radio networks must die . every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern , new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues .
it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio , but i don 't know how . "
and of course , as the computer industry develops interactively , producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea .
and they fake it .
jack berry : boys and girls , i think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set , you just get them out .
first of all , get your winky dink kits out .
put out your magic window and your erasing glove , and rub it like this .
that 's the way we get some of the magic into it , boys and girls .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and rub it out from the center to the corners , like this .
make sure you keep your magic crayons handy , your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove , because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that .
you all set ? ok , let 's get right to the first story about dusty man .
come on into the secret lab .
ph : it was the dawn of interactive tv , and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits .
those are the winky dink crayons . i know what you 're saying . " pete , i could use any ordinary open-source crayon , why do i have to buy theirs ? "
i assure you , that 's not the case .
turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window , other crayons may discolor or hurt the window .
this proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere .
it led to lawsuits -- -- federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that 's a scandal we won 't discuss today .
but we will discuss this scandal , because this man , jack berry , the host of " winky dink , " went on to become the host of " twenty one , " one of the most important quiz shows ever .
and it was rigged , and it became unraveled when this man , charles van doren , was outed after an unnatural winning streak , ending berry 's career .
and actually , ending the career of a lot of people at cbs .
it turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked .
and 50 years ago , if you 'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media , there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from , professor marshall mcluhan .
he actually understood something about a theme that we 've been discussing all week . it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications .
here he is talking from the 1960s .
marshall mcluhan : if the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad , then it 's happy . it 's like the old quiz shows . they were great tv because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
they were horrified when they discovered they 'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged .
now , then , this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers .
ph : you know , mcluhan talked about the global village .
if you substitute the word blogosphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now . let 's listen in to him .
mm : the global village is a world in which you don 't necessarily have harmony . you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business and much involvement in everybody else 's life .
it 's a sort of ann landers ' column writ large .
and it doesn 't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet , but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else 's affairs .
and so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
ph : we 'll talk a little bit more about him later .
we 're now right into the 1960s .
it 's the era of big business and data centers for computing .
but all that was about to change .
you know , the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in .
and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations , it 's not just a joke about messianism , it 's actually what we do .
but for this part of the story , i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent , john markoff .
john markoff : do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs , sex , rock ' n ' roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing , at stanford university , between 1960 and 1975 .
in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks , a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy , a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab , and doug engelbart , a computer scientist at sri , changed the world .
engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture , but while he was beginning to do his work , all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula .
there was lsd leaking out of kesey 's veterans ' hospital experiments and other areas around the campus , and there was music literally in the streets .
the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors .
people were leaving to go back to the land .
there was the vietnam war . there was black liberation . there was women 's liberation .
this was a remarkable place , at a remarkable time .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build .
and most importantly , they had this ethos of sharing information .
i think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you 're trapped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them .
the title of the book is , " what the dormouse said : how the ' 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry . "
the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , " remember what the dormouse said . feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . "
ph : by this time , computing had kind of leapt into media territory , and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley .
here 's the architecture machine group , the predecessor of the media lab , in 1981 .
meanwhile , in california , we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff .
hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks , where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture , or piece of text , or data across a file system , and we had no way of explaining it .
there was no metaphor . was it a database ?
a prototyping tool ? a scripted language ?
heck , it was everything . so we ended up writing a marketing brochure .
we asked a question about how the mind works , and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant .
a few years later , we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of , how do you get the content you want , the way you want it and the easy way ?
here 's the apple marketing video .
james burke : you 'll be pleased to know , i 'm sure , that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video .
the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks .
by far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier .
the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks .
this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
ph : i hope you realize how subversive that is .
that 's like a dick cheney speech .
you think he 's a nice balding guy , but he 's just declared war on the content business . find the commercial stuff , mash it up , tell the story your way .
now , as long as we confine this to the education market , and a personal matter between the computer and the file system , that 's fine , but as you can see , it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
a few years later , tim berners-lee worked that out .
it became a killer app of links , and today , of course , we call that the world wide web .
now , not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet , but a couple of years later , i helped bill gates do the same thing .
the year is 1993
and he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this .
we were plenty aware that we were messing with media , and on the surface , it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things , but we also missed an awful lot . let 's take a look .
narrator : the pyramids , the colosseum , the new york subway system and tv dinners , ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all .
yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology , the digital superhighway .
once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians .
the digital highway arrived in america 's living rooms late in the twentieth century .
let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible .
the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell .
though some were incredulous ... man 1 : the phone company !
narrator : stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising , david sarnoff commercializes radio .
man 2 : never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
narrator : the medium introduced america to new products .
voice 1 : say , mom , windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family .
be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work .
narrator : in 1939 , the radio corporation of america introduced television .
man 2 : never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
narrator : eventually , the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company .
and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry , and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .
ted turner : we did the work to build this , this cable industry , now the broadcasters want some of our money . i mean , it 's ridiculous .
narrator : computers , once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks , escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas .
the world and all its culture reduced to bits , the lingua franca of all media .
and the forces of convergence exploded .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
telecommunications , entertainment , computing and everything else .
man 3 : we 'll see channels for the gourmet and we 'll see channels for the pet lover .
voice 2 : next on the gourmet pet channel , decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .
narrator : all of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
at stake : the battle for you , the consumer , and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of america .
ph : we missed a lot . you know , you missed , we missed the internet , the long tail , the role of the audience , open systems , social networks .
it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media .
thomas edison had the same problem .
he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it , and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea .
well , you know where we 're going on from here .
we come into the era of the dotcom , the world wide web , and i don 't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .
but when we emerge from this and what we call web 2.0 , things actually are quite different . and i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged .
if internet one was about pages , now it 's about people .
it 's a customer , it 's an audience , it 's a person who 's participating .
it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now .
mm : because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
ph : in my own company , technorati , we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in .
that 's about 2,700 fresh , connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there .
and it 's no wonder that as we head into the writers ' strike , odd things happen .
you know , it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood , that a producer is anyone who knows a writer .
i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem .
but it 's not a joke . this is a real headline . " websites attract striking writers :
operators of sites like mydamnchannel.com could benefit from labor disputes . "
meanwhile , you have the tv bloggers going out on strike , in sympathy with the television writers .
and then you have tv guide , a fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards -- but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
to show you how schizophrenic this all is , here 's the head of myspace , or fox interactive , a news corp company , being asked , well , with the writers ' strike , isn 't this going to hurt news corp and help you online ?
man : but i , yeah , i think there 's an opportunity . as the strike continues , there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv .
ph : oh , but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch .
man : yes , well , first , you know , i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group . obviously , we hope that the strike is -- that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible .
ph : one of the great things that 's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening .
here is a clip from a video , from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in hollywood , animation worked out in israel , farmed out to croatia and india , and it 's now an international series .
narrator : the following takes place between the minutes of 2 : 15 p.m. and 2 : 18 p.m. ,
in the months preceding the presidential primaries .
voice 1 : you 'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
voice 2 : you mean we 'll have to live here , together ?
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
ph : the company that created this , aniboom , is an interesting example of where this is headed . traditional tv animation costs , say , between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute .
they 're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and they 're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end , in a much more entrepreneurial manner . so , it 's a different model .
what the entertainment business is struggling with , the world of brands is figuring out .
for example , nike now understands that nike plus is not just a device in its shoe , it 's a network to hook its customers together .
and the head of marketing at nike says , " people are coming to our site an average of three times a week . we don 't have to go to them . " which means television advertising is down 57 percent for nike .
or , as nike 's head of marketing says , " we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive .
we 're in the business of connecting with consumers . "
and media companies realize the audience is important also .
here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones , powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page -- user-generated content married up with traditional content .
it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them .
or , as geoffrey moore once told me , it 's intellectual curiosity that 's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere .
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .
one of my heroes is songwriter , ally willis , who just wrote " the color purple " and has been an r and -- rhythm and blues writer , and this is what she said about where songwriting 's going .
ally willis : where millions of collaborators wanted the song , because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about .
ph : so , to wrap up , i 'd love to throw it back to marshall mcluhan , who , 40 years ago , was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change , and i think that , today , traditional hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before .
but i don 't need to tell you this , let 's throw it back to him .
narrator : we are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
they don 't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up .
they think of the old medium , because the old medium is always the content of the new medium , as movies tend to be the content of tv , and as books used to be the content , novels used to be the content of movies .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observable , highly noticeable , but the real , real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
ph : i think it 's a great time of enthrallment .
there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there . content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth , and part of social communications , and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what 's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
thanks very much .

rob forbes on ways of seeing
i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary .
that 's a bit lofty ; i 'm really more of something like a street walker .
i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design , and studying design in the public sector .
i take about 5,000 photographs a year , and i thought that i would edit from these , and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you .
and i used three criteria : the first was , i thought i 'd talk about real design within reach , design that 's free , not design not quite within reach , as we 're fondly known by our competition and competitors , but stuff that you can find on the streets , stuff that was free , stuff that was available to all people , and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .
i 'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example .
a very common public design done in the ' 50s .
it 's got a nice kind of flowing , organic form , very consistent with the brazilian culture --
i think good design adds to culture .
wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york .
but i think these are my sort of information highways : i live in much more of an analog world , where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange , and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us .
how did i get started in this business ?
i was a ceramic designer for about 10 years , and just loved utilitarian form --
simple things that we use every day , little compositions of color and surface on form .
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
a couple of years into the process , i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around , looking for design .
and i had a bit of a wake-up call in amsterdam : i was there going into the design stores , and mixing with our crowd of designers , and i recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same , and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also .
we know a lot about what 's going on with design around the world , and it 's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture .
i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized , you know , the big story from amsterdam isn 't what 's in the design stores , it 's what 's out on the streets , and maybe it 's self-explanatory , but a city that hasn 't been taken over by modernism , that 's preserved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected .
and i write a newsletter that goes out every week , and i wrote an article about this , and it got such enormous response that i realized that design , that common design , that 's in the public area means a lot to people , and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog .
i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design , like basel , where vitra is located , or in northern italy --
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles , and where pedestrian areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic , and i 'm sure the skeptic eye would say , no , the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can 't afford cars , but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected .
you wouldn 't look at this and call this a designer bike : a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum .
but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
and so i look at this bike as not being a designer bike , but being a very good example of design .
and since that time in amsterdam , i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities , looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn 't under so much of a designer 's signature .
i was in buenos aires very recently , and i went to see this bridge by santiago calatrava .
he 's a spanish architect and designer .
and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --
i love bridges , metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --
and it was a bit of a disappointment , because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it ; it really wasn 't in use .
and i recognized that oftentimes design , when you 're set up to see design , it can be a bit of a letdown .
but there were lots of other things going on in this area : it was a kind of construction zone ; a lot of buildings were going up .
and , approaching a building from a distance , you don 't see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a diebenkorn or something .
but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design .
and going a little closer , you get a different perspective .
i find these little vignettes , these little accidental pieces of design , to be refreshing .
they give me , i don 't know , a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve .
down the road , there was another building , a nice visual structure : horizontal , vertical elements , little decorative lines going across , these magenta squiggles , the workmen being reduced to decorative elements , just a nice , kind of , breakup of the urban place .
and , you know , that no longer exists .
you 've captured it for a moment , and finding this little still life 's like listening to little songs or something : it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure .
antoine predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in san diego called petco park .
a terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games ; i go and see design relationships .
just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture , and the way that the trees form vertical elements .
red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might .
just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in italy .
construction site in new york : red having this kind of emotional power that 's almost an equivalent with the way in which --
cuteness of puppies and such .
side street in italy .
red drew me into this little composition , optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox , door service , plumbing . it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions .
in italy , you know , almost everything , kind of , looks good .
simple menus put on a board , achieving , kind of , the sort of balance .
but i 'm convinced that it 's because you 're walking around the streets and seeing things .
red can be comical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana .
color can animate simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i 'll stop .
i don 't always know why i take photographs of things .
a nice visual composition of symmetry .
curves against sharp things .
it 's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york .
i 've come across some other just , kind of , curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations , but -- these things amuse me .
sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in san francisco --
a trash can that 's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships , and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture .
so , there 's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go .
havana is a wonderful area .
it 's quite free of commercial clutter : you don 't see our logos and brands and names , and therefore you 're alert to things physically .
and this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone , and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that .
and cuba needs to be far more resourceful , because of the blockades and things , but a really wonderful playground .
i 've often wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design .
in our area , in furnishings , they 're sort of way at the top .
the dutch are good also , but the italians are good .
and i came across this little street in venice , where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine .
and i realized that , you know , italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem , or they can choose to ignore them , but these -- you don 't have warring factions , and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy so innovative and so tolerant .
the past and the present work quite well together in italy also , and i think that it 's recognizable there , and has an important effect on culture , because their public spaces are protected , their sidewalks are protected , and you 're actually able to confront these things physically , and i think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things .
a change might be a typical street corner in san francisco .
and i use this -- this is , sort of , what i consider to be urban spam .
i notice this stuff because i walk a lot , but here , private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector .
and as i look at it , i sort of say , you know , the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it , and it 's just my call to say to all of us , public policy won 't change this at all ; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously .
the extreme might be in italy where , again , there 's kind of some type of control over what 's happening in the environment is very evident , even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals .
i walk to work every day or ride my scooter , and i come down and park in this little spot .
and i came down one day , and all the bikes were red .
now , this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop , and can do stuff , but this was an actual moment when i got off my bike , and i looked and i thought , it 's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement .
and it reminded me that --
to keep in the present , to look out for these kinds of things .
it gave me possibilities for wonder --
if maybe it 's a yellow day in san francisco , and we could all agree , and create some installations .
but it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind .
and i don 't know if there 's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements .
i was at the art show in miami in december , and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art , and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is , but having a great time looking at it .
and i came outside , and the valets for this car service had created , you know , quite a nice little collage of these car keys , and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo .
and i thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements , it can do just about anything .
i don 't have very many shots of people , because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form .
i was in a small restaurant in spain , having lunch --
one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself , and you have a glass of wine , and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet , and feeling very lucky , and a bus load of tourists arrived , emptied out , filled up the restaurant .
in a very short period of time , completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such , and we had to get up and leave ; it was just that uncomfortable .
and at that moment , the sun came out , and through this perforated screen , a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear , and we left the restaurant kind of feeling o.k. about stuff .
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced --
kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in monoculture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that 's important to us .
the last shots that i have deal with --
coming back to this theme of sidewalks , and i wanted to say something here about -- i 'm , kind of , optimistic , you know .
post-second world war , the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities .
a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
a lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department . it 's as easy to rag on cars as it is on wal-mart ; i 'm not going to do that .
but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
i think that they are , that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole .
cities are the place where we 're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .
we go there for stimulation in art and all those other things .
but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas .
a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature .
the u.s. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal , and i want to single out a place like chicago , where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area .
you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop , but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street : there 's actual diversity in the plants .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
there are common elements of this that you 'll see throughout chicago , and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks , but the fact that it performs a very important social function .
there are a lot of free concerts , for example , that go on in this area ; it has a phenomenal acoustic system .
but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant , and almost an international model .
i work on the mayor 's council in san francisco , on the international design council for mayors , and chicago is looked at as the pinnacle , and i really would like to salute mayor daley and the folks there .
i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys .
this is also in millennium park in chicago , where the spanish artist-designer plensa has created , kind of , a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area .
and it 's a welcoming area , i think , inclusive of diversity , reflective of diversity , and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u.s. can really take a leadership role , and chicago is one example .
thank you very much .

niels diffrient rethinks the way we sit down
when i was five years old i fell in love with airplanes .
now i 'm talking about the ' 30s .
in the ' 30s an airplane had two wings and a round motor ,
and was always flown by a guy who looked like cary grant .
he had high leather boots , jodhpurs , an old leather jacket , a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles -- and , inevitably , a white scarf , to flow in the wind .
he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter , devil-may-care saunter , flick the cigarette away , grab the girl waiting here , give her a kiss .
and then mount his airplane , maybe for the last time .
of course i always wondered what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first .
but this was real romance to me .
everything about flying in those years , which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment -- was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time .
so as a youngster , i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes , constantly drawing airplanes .
it 's the way i got a part of this romance .
and of course , in a way , when i say romance , i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation .
i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product .
the product was that airplane .
but it built a romance .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal . you know , from a romance language .
so that it was something that just got into your spirit .
it did mine .
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .
i wanted to build airplanes .
so i built model airplanes .
and i found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough .
you couldn 't transfer those to the model itself .
if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying .
you had to learn about aeronautics .
you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .
and of course , as a model in those years , you couldn 't control it .
so it had to be self-righting , and stay up without crashing .
so i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings --
the shape of the wing , the shape of the fuselage and so on --
and build an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying .
and in so doing , i could produce a model that would fly , stay in the air .
and it had , once it was in the air , some of this romance that i was in love with .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
and when i was sitting in classes -- in which no one asked me to draw an airplane -- to my surprise .
i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing .
i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
one day a young man looked over my shoulder , he said , " you draw very well .
you should be in the art department . " and i said , " why ? "
and he said , " well for one thing , there are more girls there . "
so my romance was temporarily shifted .
and i went into art because they appreciated drawing .
studied painting ; didn 't do very well at that .
went through design , some architecture .
eventually hired myself out as a designer .
and for the following 25 years , living in italy , living in america , i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it --
this sense , this aesthetic feeling , for the experience revolving around a designed object .
and it exists .
any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday ? -- at the track , you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars .
well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry .
and i quit .
and i started up a very small operation -- went from 40 people to one , in an effort to rediscover my innocence .
i wanted to get back where the romance was .
and i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point ,
even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work , on the interiors .
so i chose furniture .
and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them .
i 'd designed a lot of chairs , over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines --
all kinds of things .
but not office chairs .
so i started doing that .
and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane .
only this time , instead of the product being shaped by the wind , it was shaped by the human body .
so the discipline was -- as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air , for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body ,
and what the body needs , wants , indicates it needs .
and that 's the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you .
i should say one more thing . when i was doing those model airplanes , i did everything .
i conceived the kind of airplane .
i basically engineered it .
i built it .
and i flew it .
and that 's the way i work now .
when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .
design nowadays , if you mean it , you don 't start with styling sketches .
i started with a lot of loose ideas ,
roughly eight or nine years ago .
and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office ,
at the work place -- people who worked , and used task seating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long .
and i felt , the one thing they don 't need , is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there .
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it .
so my idea was that , instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls , that you would sit on the chair , and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline .
now that may not mean a lot to some of you .
but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow .
so that if you sit down on my chair , whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six , it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don 't have to look for something to adjust .
i 'll tell you right up front , this is a trade off .
there are drawbacks to this .
one is : you can 't accommodate everybody .
there are some very light people ,
some extremely heavy people ,
maybe people with a lot of bulk up top .
they begin to fall off the end of your chart .
but the compromise , i felt , was in my favor because most people don 't adjust their chairs .
they will sit in them forever .
i had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
she said , " oh i love it . "
she said , " but it 's too high . "
so he said , " well i 'll come over and look at it . "
he came over and looked at it .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
she said , " oh it 's wonderful . how did you do that ? "
and he showed her the lever .
well , that 's typical of a lot of us working in chairs .
and why should you get a 20-page manual about how to run a chair ?
i had one for a wristwatch once . 20 pages .
anyway , i felt that it was important that you didn 't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached
from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted .
so i spent a long time .
i said i worked eight or nine years on it .
and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own .
i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot easier , so that you didn 't have to use a button .
and so after many trials , many failures , we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other .
and they go up easily .
and stop where you want .
you can put them down , essentially out of the way .
no arms at all .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
and this was another thing that i felt ,
while not nearly as romantic as cary grant , nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation , aesthetic performance into a product .
the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .
the more the angle between here and here opens up -- and nowadays , with a screen in front of you , you don 't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline , so we keep it at more or less the same level -- but you transfer weight off your tailbones .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ?
you feel that bone under there ?
just your own .
there 's two of them , one on either side .
all the weight of your upper torso -- your arms , your head -- goes right down through your back , your spine , into those bones when you sit .
and that 's a lot of load .
just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off .
now that , if your spine is not held in a good position , will help bend your spine the wrong way , and so on .
so to unload that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can recline .
when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end , and transfer it to your back .
at the same time , as i say , you open up this joint .
and breathability is good .
but to do that , if you have any amount of recline , it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always , automatically hold your head in a vertical position , see ?
as i recline , my head says more or less vertical .
well if you 're reclined a great deal , you have to use muscle force to hold your head there .
so that 's where a headrest comes in .
now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it 'll fit , you know , a tall guy and a short girl .
so here we are .
i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place .
but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position .
and you need it in a different position when you 're upright , then when you 're reclined .
so i knew that had to be solved , and had to be automatic .
so if you watch this chair as i recline , the headrest comes up to meet my neck .
ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area , right there .
so that part of it took a long time to work out .
and there is a variety of other things : the shape of the cushions ,
the gel we put . we stole the idea from bicycle seats , and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you don 't get hard spots .
you cant hit your elbow on bottom .
and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people .
while you 're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-footer , or you can adjust it for the six-foot-six guy --
all within the scope of a few simple adjustments .

in a single year , there are 200-300 million cases of malaria and 50-100 million cases of dengue fever worldwide . so : why haven 't we found a way to effectively kill mosquitos yet ? hadyn parry presents a fascinating solution : genetically engineering male mosquitos to make them sterile , and releasing the insects into the wild , to cut down on disease-carrying species .

hadyn parry : re-engineering mosquitos to fight disease
so i 'd like to start by focusing on the world 's most dangerous animal .
now , when you talk about dangerous animals , most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks .
but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito .
the mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history .
in fact , probably adding them all together , the mosquito has killed more humans .
and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague .
and you would think , would you not , that with all our science , with all our advances in society , with better towns , better civilizations , better sanitation , wealth , that we would get better at controlling mosquitos , and hence reduce this disease .
and that 's not really the case .
if it was the case , we wouldn 't have between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year , and we wouldn 't have a million and a half deaths from malaria , and we wouldn 't have a disease that was relatively unknown 50 years ago now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have , and that 's called dengue fever .
so 50 years ago , pretty much no one had heard of it , no one certainly in the european environment .
but dengue fever now , according to the world health organization , infects between 50 and 100 million people every year , so that 's equivalent to the whole of the population of the u.k. being infected every year .
other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
in the last 50 years , the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold .
now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is , for those who don 't know .
now let 's assume you go on holiday .
let 's assume you go to the caribbean , or you might go to mexico . you might go to latin america , asia , africa , anywhere in saudi arabia .
you might go to india , the far east .
it doesn 't really matter . it 's the same mosquito , and it 's the same disease . you 're at risk .
and let 's assume you 're bitten by a mosquito that 's carrying that virus .
well , you could develop flu-like symptoms .
they could be quite mild .
you could develop nausea , headache , and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking .
and that 's the nickname given to this disease .
it 's called breakbone fever , because that 's how you can feel .
now the odd thing is , is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito , and you 've had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you 're bitten again with that strain , it doesn 't affect you .
but it 's not one virus , it 's four , and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three .
so the next time you get dengue fever , if it 's a different strain , you 're more susceptible , you 're likely to get worse symptoms , and you 're more likely to get the more severe forms , hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome .
so you don 't want dengue once , and you certainly don 't want it again .
so why is it spreading so fast ?
and the answer is this thing .
this is aedes aegypti .
now this is a mosquito that came , like its name suggests , out of north africa , and it 's spread round the world .
now , in fact , a single mosquito will only travel about 200 yards in its entire life . they don 't travel very far .
what they 're very good at doing is hitchhiking , particularly the eggs .
they will lay their eggs in clear water , any pool , any puddle , any birdbath , any flower pot , anywhere there 's clear water , they 'll lay their eggs , and if that clear water is near freight , it 's near a port , if it 's anywhere near transport , those eggs will then get transported around the world .
and that 's what 's happened . mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world , and these insects have infested over 100 countries , and there 's now 2.5 billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides .
to give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened , in the mid- ' 70s , brazil declared , " we have no aedes aegypti , " and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it , trying to control it , just one species of mosquito .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can 't remember which , i saw a reuters report that said madeira had had their first cases of dengue , about 52 cases , with about 400 probable cases .
that 's two days ago .
interestingly , madeira first got the insect in 2005 , and here we are , a few years later , first cases of dengue .
so the one thing you 'll find is that where the mosquito goes , dengue will follow .
once you 've got the mosquito in your area , anyone coming into that area with dengue , mosquito will bite them , mosquito will bite somewhere else , somewhere else , somewhere else , and you 'll get an epidemic .
so we must be good at killing mosquitos .
i mean , that can 't be very difficult .
well , there 's two principle ways .
the first way is that you use larvicides .
you use chemicals . you put them into water where they breed .
now in an urban environment , that 's extraordinarily difficult .
you 've got to get your chemical into every puddle , every birdbath , every tree trunk .
it 's just not practical .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
this is a picture of fogging .
here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment .
you could do the same with a space spray .
this is really unpleasant stuff , and if it was any good , we wouldn 't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn 't have this massive increase in dengue fever .
so it 's not very effective , but it 's probably the best thing we 've got at the moment .
having said that , actually , your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt and a little bit of deet to go with it .
so let 's start again . let 's design a product , right from the word go , and decide what we want .
well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population .
there 's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there .
we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can 't get the disease transmission .
clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans . we are going to use it in and around humans .
it has to be safe .
we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment .
we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo .
maybe a better product comes along in 20 , 30 years .
fine . we don 't want a lasting environmental impact .
we want something that 's relatively cheap , or cost-effective , because there 's an awful lot of countries involved , and some of them are emerging markets , some of them emerging countries , low-income .
and finally , you want something that 's species-specific .
you want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue , but you don 't really want to get all the other insects .
some are quite beneficial . some are important to your ecosystem .
this one 's not . it 's invaded you .
but you don 't want to get all of the insects .
you just want to get this one .
and most of the time , you 'll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
it 's got to get into people 's houses , into the bedrooms , into the kitchens .
now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project , and that is , firstly , males don 't bite .
it 's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
the male can 't bite you , won 't bite you , doesn 't have the mouth parts to bite you .
it 's just the female .
and the second is a phenomenon that males are very , very good at finding females .
if there 's a male mosquito that you release , and if there 's a female around , that male will find the female .
so basically , we 've used those two factors .
so here 's a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring , then the offspring don 't survive , and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around , you have none .
and if you can put more , i 'll call them sterile , that the offspring will actually die at different stages , but i 'll call them sterile for now .
if you put more sterile males out into the environment , then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one , and you will bring that population down .
so the males will go out , they 'll look for females , they 'll mate . if they mate successfully , then no offspring .
if they don 't find a female , then they 'll die anyway .
they only live a few days .
and that 's exactly where we are .
so this is technology that was developed in oxford university a few years ago .
the company itself , oxitec , we 've been working for the last 10 years , very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you 'd get with a pharmaceutical company .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready .
and then we 've gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits .
so we 've done field trials now in the cayman islands , a small one in malaysia , and two more now in brazil .
and what 's the result ?
well , the result has been very good .
in about four months of release , we 've brought that population of mosquitos - in most cases we 're dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small - we 've taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
and in fact , the numbers after that get , those get very difficult to count , because there just aren 't any left .
so that 's been what we 've seen in cayman , it 's been what we 've seen in brazil in those trials .
and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000 , so we can see this work at big scale .
and we 've got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
we can transport them around the world .
it 's not very expensive , because it 's a coffee cup -- something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs .
so freight costs aren 't our biggest problem .
so we 've got that . you could call it a mosquito factory .
and for brazil , where we 've been doing some trials , the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory , far bigger than ours , and we 'll use that for scaling up in brazil .
there you are . we 've sent mosquito eggs .
we 've separated the males from the females .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
it 's actually a little bit more precise than that .
you want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area .
so you take a google map , you divide it up , work out how far they can fly , and make sure you 're releasing such that you get coverage of the area , and then you go back , and within a very short space of time , you 're bringing that population right the way down .
we 've also done this in agriculture .
we 've got several different species of agriculture coming along , and i 'm hoping that soon we 'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria .
so that 's where we stand at the moment , and i 've just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we 've now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
we have g.m. crops , we have pharmaceuticals , we have new vaccines , all using roughly the same technology , but with very different outcomes .
and i 'm in favor , actually . of course i am .
i 'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don 't work well or have become unacceptable .
and although the techniques are similar , the outcomes are very , very different , and if you take our approach , for example , and you compare it to , say , g.m. crops , both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit .
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
but whereas a g.m. crop is trying to protect the plant , for example , and give it an advantage , what we 're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have , rendering it unable to reproduce effectively .
so for the mosquito , it 's a dead end .
thank you very much .

bill davenhall : your health depends on where you live
can geographic information make you healthy ?
in 2001 i got hit by a train .
my train was a heart attack .
i found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
and i suddenly realized something : that i was completely in the dark .
i started asking my questions , " well , why me ? "
" why now ? " " why here ? "
" could my doctor have warned me ? "
so , what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
genetics , lifestyle and environment .
that 's going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we 're going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
well , i understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
and you know why i understand that ?
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor 's office ?
i mean , if you 're lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
do it over and over again . and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did i forget any history ?
but this part of the equation i didn 't really get ,
and i don 't think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
what does that mean , my environment ?
well , it can mean a lot of things .
this is my life . these are my life places .
we all have these .
while i 'm talking i 'd like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
you spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
and if you 're like me , you 're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
so , it 's not really simple when somebody asks you , " where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don 't even see ? "
well , when i have done this on myself , i always come to the conclusion that i spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
and i don 't wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though i 'm an extensive global trekker .
now , i 'm going to take you on a little journey here .
i started off in scranton , pennsylvania .
i don 't know if anybody might hail from northeastern pennsylvania , but this is where i spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
you know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this .
and if you 've been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
so then i decided to leave that part of the world ,
and i was going to go to the mid-west .
ok , so i ended up in louisville , kentucky .
well , i decided to be neighbors to a place called rubbertown .
they manufacture plastics . they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
okay , i spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
and on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
it was insidious and it was really happening .
then i decided i had to get really smart , i would take this job in the west coast .
and i moved to redlands california .
very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as i like to call them , i filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
okay ? almost like the highest in the nation .
alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
if you 've been there , you know what i 'm talking about .
so , what 's wrong with this picture ?
well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
the one thing that never happens in my doctor 's office : they never ask me about my place history .
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , " where have you lived ? "
they haven 't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach .
they really don 't do that . it 's missing .
look at the kind of data that 's available .
this data 's from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
now , i 've circled the places where i 've been .
well , by design , if i wanted to have a heart attack i 'd been in the right places . right ?
so , how many people are in the white ?
how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
anybody ? boy you 're lucky .
how many have spent it in the red places ?
oh , not so lucky .
there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
they give us some sense of what 's going to be our train wreck .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
and it 's not in yours either .
so , here 's my friend paul .
he 's a colleague . he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
and you can see he 's been to a few places around the united states .
and this is where he has spent most of his time .
if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do .
anybody got any clues ? ski . right .
we can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time .
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa .
did you know that data existed ?
for every community in the united states , you could have your own personalized map of that .
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
this is how paul did it . he did it with his iphone .
this might be what we end up with .
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said i paid at the counter . right ?
this could be my little assessment .
and he looks at that and he says , " whoa bill , i suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you 're out here in beautiful california , and it 's warm every day , that you get out and run at six o 'clock at night .
i 'd suggest that that 's a bad idea bill , because of this report . "
what i 'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
it 's called geomedicine . there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
and they 're in the early stages of development .
these programs need to be supported ,
and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information i 've shared here with you today .
the second thing we need to do is while we 're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
it not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
but it will also be useful for us .
i could have made the decision , if i had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the united states , couldn 't i ? i could make that decision .
or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
with that , i would like to just say that jack lord said this almost 10 years ago .
just look at that for a minute .
that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
that was what he was talking about on that quote .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
so , i 'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
so with that , i 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . thank you .

rives controls the internet
i wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , " i 'm really getting into the internet lately . i just wish it were more organized . " so ...
if i controlled the internet , you could auction your broken heart on ebay . take the money ; go to amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you 've never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
if i were in charge of the internet , you could mapquest your lover 's mood swings . hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , u-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin ' . you could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
some days , i 'm as shallow as a baking pan ,
but i still stretch miles in all directions .
if i owned the internet , napster , monster and friendster.com would be one big website . that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job
and you 're really just chattin ' with your pals .
heck , if i ran the web , you could email dead people .
they would not email you back
--
but you 'd get an automated reply .
their name in your inbox
--
it 's all you wanted anyway .
and a message saying , " hey , it 's me . i miss you .
listen , you 'll see being dead is dandy . now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy . " if i designed the internet , childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard , with a ski pole for a sword , trashcan lid for a shield , shouting , " i am the emperor of oranges . i am the emperor of oranges . i am the emperor of oranges . " now follow me , ok ?
grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
one , two , three .
that links with hotdiggitydog.com .
that is my grandfather .
they take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad. he forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me --
the guy who usually goes too far .
so if i were emperor of the internet , i guess i 'd still be mortal , huh ?
but at that point , i would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis
--
so i would outlaw spam on my first day in office .
i wouldn 't need it .
i 'd be like some kind of internet genius , and me , i 'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- i 'd go wireless .
huh ? maybe google would hire this .
i could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise , as wild and as organized as i think a modern-day miracle / oracle can get , but , ooh-eee , you want to bet just how whack and un-pc your mac or pc is going to be when i 'm rocking
hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net ?
i guess it 's just like life .
it is not a question of if you can --
it 's : do ya ?
we can interfere with the interface .
we can make " you 've got hallelujah " the national anthem of cyberspace
every lucky time we log on .
you don 't say a prayer .
you don 't write a psalm .
you don 't chant an " om . "
you send one blessed email to whomever you 're thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com .
thank you , ted .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / robert _ neuwirth _ the _ power _ of _ the _ informal _ economy.html
robert neuwirth spent four years among the chaotic stalls of street markets , talking to pushcart hawkers and gray marketers , to study the remarkable " system d , " the world 's unlicensed economic network . responsible for some 1.8 billion jobs , it 's an economy of underappreciated power and scope .
business , cities , community , economics , global issues , law
1555
robert neuwirth : the power of the informal economy
in system d , this is a store , and what i mean by that is that this is a photograph i took in makoko , shantytown in lagos , nigeria .
it 's built over the lagoon , and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop , and so the store comes to you .
and in the same community , this is business synergy .
this is the boat that that lady was paddling around in , and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles .
and this is a global business .
ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in lagos , and i asked her , " where does the fish come from ? "
and i thought she 'd say , " oh , you know , up the lagoon somewhere , or maybe across africa , "
but you 'll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
it 's caught here , frozen , shipped down to lagos , smoked , and sold for a tiny increment of profit on the streets of lagos .
and this is a business incubator .
this is olusosun dump , the largest garbage dump in lagos , and 2,000 people work here , and i found this out from this fellow , andrew saboru .
andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump , earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler , which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump . now he 's a scrap dealer .
that 's his little depot behind him , and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage .
this is a shopping mall .
this is oshodi market in lagos .
jorge luis borges had a story called " the aleph , " and the aleph is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists , and for me , this image is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists .
so , what am i talking about when i talk about system d ?
it 's traditionally called the informal economy , the underground economy , the black market .
i don 't conceive of it that way .
i think it 's really important to understand that something like this is totally open . it 's right there for you to find .
all of this is happening openly , and aboveboard .
there 's nothing underground about it .
it 's our prejudgment that it 's underground .
i 've pirated the term system d from the former french colonies .
there 's a word in french that is debrouillardise , that means to be self-reliant , and the former french colonies have turned that into system d for the economy of self-reliance , or the diy economy .
but governments hate the diy economy , and that 's why -- i took this picture in 2007 , and this is the same market in 2009 -- and i think , when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness , they didn 't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone .
i think what we have is a pickle problem .
i had a friend who worked at a pickle factory ,
and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt , and his job was to pick off the ones that didn 't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled " relish " where they 'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit .
this is the pickle economy .
we 're all focusing on - this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times - we 're all focusing on the luxury economy .
it 's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year , and that 's a vast amount of money , right ?
that 's three times the gross domestic product of switzerland .
so it 's vast . but it should come with an asterisk , and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world .
1.8 billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal .
that 's a huge number , and what does that mean ?
well , it means if it were united in a single political system , one country , call it " the united street sellers republic , " the u.s.s.r. , or " bazaaristan , " it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year , and that would make it the second largest economy in the world , after the united states .
and given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next 15 years will come from emerging economies in the developing world , it could easily overtake the united states and become the largest economy in the world .
so the implications of that are vast , because it means that this is where employment is - 1.8 billion people - and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world , because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive , as andrew saboru did .
big businesses have recognized this , and what 's fascinating about this slide , it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off. it 's that the gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called uac foods that 's active throughout africa and the middle east , but the gala sausage roll is not sold in stores .
uac foods has recognized that it won 't sell if it 's in stores . it 's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers who run around the streets of lagos at bus stations and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack , and it 's been sold that way for 40 years .
it 's a business plan for a corporation .
and it 's not just in africa .
here 's mr. clean looking amorously at all the other procter & gamble products , and procter & gamble , you know , the statistic always cited is that wal-mart is their largest customer , and it 's true , as one store , wal-mart buys 15 percent , thus 15 percent of procter & gamble 's business is with wal-mart , but their largest market segment is something that they call " high frequency stores , " which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in system d , the informal economy , and procter & gamble makes 20 percent of its money from that market segment , and it 's the only market segment that 's growing .
so procter & gamble says , " we don 't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that .
we want our products in that store . "
and then there 's mobile phones .
this is an ad for mtn , which is a south african multinational active in about 25 countries , and when they came into nigeria - nigeria is the big dog in africa .
one in seven africans is a nigerian , and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market
in nigeria . and when mtn came in , they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in the u.k. or in europe -- expensive monthly plans , you get a phone , you pay overages , you 're killed with fees -- and their plan crashed and burned .
and they went back to the drawing board , and they retooled , and they came up with another plan : we don 't sell you the phone , we don 't sell you the monthly plan .
we only sell you airtime .
and where 's the airtime sold ?
it 's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets , where people are unregistered , unlicensed , but mtn makes most of its profits , perhaps 90 percent of its profits , from selling through system d , the informal economy .
and where do the phones come from ?
well , they come from here . this is in guangzhou , china , and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking electronics mall , you find the guangzhou dashatou second-hand trade center ,
and if you go in there , you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes , and where are they going ?
they 're going to eddy in lagos .
now , most of the phones there are not second-hand at all .
the name is a misnomer .
most of them are pirated . they have the name brand on them , but they 're not manufactured by the name brand .
now , are there downsides to that ?
well , i guess . you know , china has no - - no intellectual property , right ?
versace without the vowels .
zhuomani instead of armani .
s. guuuci , and -- all around the world this is how products are being distributed , so , for instance , in one street market on rua 25 de marco in sao paulo , brazil , you can buy fake designer glasses .
you can buy cloned cologne .
you can buy pirated dvds , of course .
you can buy new york yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns .
you can buy cuecas baratas , designer underwear that isn 't really manufactured by a designer , and even pirated evangelical mixtapes .
now , businesses tend to complain about this , and their , they , i don 't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it , but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy ,
and they told me , " well , you can 't quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , " but they use piracy as market research .
the sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that pumas are being pirated , or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren 't being pirated , they know they 've done something wrong .
so it 's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this , and the people who are buying , the pirates , are not their customers anyway , because their customers want the real deal .
now , there 's another problem .
this is a real street sign in lagos , nigeria .
all of system d really doesn 't pay taxes , right ?
and when i think about that , first of all i think that government is a social contract between the people and the government , and if the government isn 't transparent , then the people aren 't going to be transparent either ,
but also that we 're blaming the little guy who doesn 't pay his taxes , and we 're not recognizing that everyone 's fudging things all over the world , including some extremely respected businesses , and i 'll give you one example .
there was one company that paid 4,000 bribes in the first decade of this millennium , and a million dollars in bribes every business day , right ?
all over the world . and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it 's wrong of us to blame - and i 'm not singling out siemens , i 'm saying everyone does it . okay ?
i just want to end by saying that if adam smith had framed out a theory of the flea market instead of the free market , what would be sum of the principles ?
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative , and this is a thought from the brazilian legal scholar roberto mangabeira unger .
cooperative development is a way forward .
secondly , from the [ austrian ] anarchist philosopher paul feyerabend , facts are relative , and what is a massive right of self-reliance to a nigerian businessperson is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people , and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are .
and third is , and i 'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg , that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency , alternate currencies are also very important , and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks .
and so i just want to leave you there , and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way .
thank you very much .

greg lynn on calculus in architecture
what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture .
what 's interesting about architects is , we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature , and arguably , beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature .
so , for roughly 300 years , the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture , because the nose was one-fifth of your head , or because your head was one-seventh of your body .
and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- it wasn 't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions , so a room would be dimensioned as one-fourth of a facade ; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units , and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision : finer and finer and finer .
in the 15th century , the decimal point was invented ; architects stopped using fractions , and they had a new model of nature .
so , what 's going on today is that there 's a model of natural form which is calculus-based and which is using digital tools , and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form , and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature .
the best example of this would probably be the gothic , and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus , although the gothic architects weren 't really using calculus to define their forms .
but what was important is , the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form .
so , examples like christopher wren 's king 's cross : you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines , so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
much later , robert maillart 's bridges , which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola .
the hanging chain models of antonio gaudi , the catalan architect .
the end of the 19th century , beginning of the 20th century , and how that hanging chain model translates into archways and vaulting .
so , in all of these examples , structure is the determining force .
frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall .
interestingly , in the last 10 years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery , with the structural engineer chris williams .
in all these examples , there 's one ideal form , because these are thought in terms of structure .
and as an architect , i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting , because i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment .
so , what i thought i would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of , whenever you think about nature , and that 's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution .
my hero is actually not darwin ; it 's a guy named william bateson , father of greg bateson , who was here for a long time in monterey .
and he was what you 'd call a teratologist : he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
so , instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average , he 'd always look for the exception . so , in this example , which is an example of what 's called bateson 's rule , he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb .
when i first saw this image , 10 years ago , i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
so , what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations , instead of having a thumb , you would either get another opposable thumb , or you would get four fingers . so , the mutations reverted to symmetry .
and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking , which is that wherever you lose information in a system , you revert back to symmetry .
so , symmetry wasn 't the sign of order and organization -- which is what i was always understanding , and as is an architect -- symmetry was the absence of information .
so , whenever you lost information , you 'd move to symmetry ; whenever you added information to a system , you would break symmetry .
so , this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form .
you know , literally after seeing that image , and finding out what bateson was working with , we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form .
to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus : the fact that they 're calculus-based means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements .
so , in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components , so there might be up to , say , 50,000 pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now that all need to get organized .
now , typically you 'd think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension .
you know , i haven 't verified this , but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension , because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines .
the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting , they 're all losing their modular quality , and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions .
that 's because we 're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design .
calculus is also a mathematics of curves . so , even a straight line , defined with calculus , is a curve .
it 's just a curve without inflection .
so , a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it 's automobiles , architecture , products , etc . , it 's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .
the intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know , in the example of the nose to the face , there 's a fractional part-to-whole idea .
with calculus , the whole idea of subdivision is more complex , because the whole and the parts are one continuous series .
it 's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus , so i brought some images to just describe how that works .
this is a korean church that we did in queens .
and in this example , you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive , but they 're repetitive without being modular .
each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension , and all of the connections are unique angles .
now , the only way we could design that , or possibly construct it , is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .
it also is much more dynamic , so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it , because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .
so the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume , when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista .
and you also get a sense of visual movement in the space , because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern , so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar .
i think that 's one of the main changes , also , in architecture : that we 're starting to look now not for some ideal form , like a latin cross for a church , but actually all the traits of a church : so , light that comes from behind from an invisible source , directionality that focuses you towards an altar .
it turns out it 's not rocket science to design a sacred space .
you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .
so , these are the different perspectives of that interior , which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form .
in terms of construction and manufacturing , this is a kilometer-long housing block that was built in the ' 70s in amsterdam .
and here we 've broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods , and differentiated those neighborhoods .
i won 't go into too much description of any of these projects , but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses .
because we 're using escalators to move people , all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads .
so , every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building .
so , working with bentley and microstation , we 've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information , so that if we change any element along the length of the building , not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses , but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building . so it 's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we 're adding onto .
so , it 's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel .
but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components , one to another .
this idea has , kind of , brought me into doing some product design , and it 's because design firms that have connections to architects , like , i 'm working with vitra , which is a furniture company , and alessi , which is a houseware company .
they saw this actually solving a problem : this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic .
so , not to pick on bmw , or to celebrate them , but take bmw as an example .
they have to , in 2005 , have a distinct identity for all their models of cars .
so , the 300 series , or whatever their newest car is , the 100 series that 's coming out , has to look like the 700 series , at the other end of their product line , so they need a distinct , coherent identity , which is bmw .
at the same time , there 's a person paying 30,000 dollars for a 300-series car , and a person paying 70,000 dollars for a 700 series , and that person paying more than double doesn 't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .
so they have to also discriminate between these products .
so , as manufacturing starts to allow more design options , this problem gets exacerbated , of the whole and the parts .
now , as an architect , part-to-whole relationships is all i think about , but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of an issue for companies .
so , the first kind of test product we did was with alessi , which was for a coffee and tea set .
it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set ; we knew that at the beginning . so , i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego , and we used an exploded titanium forming method that 's used in the aerospace industry .
basically what we can do , is just cut a graphite mold , put it in an oven , heat it to 1,000 degrees , gently inflate titanium that 's soft , and then explode it at the last minute into this form .
but what 's great about it is , the forms are only a few hundred dollars .
the titanium 's several thousand dollars , but the forms are very cheap .
so , we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped , very similar to that housing project i showed you , and we could recombine those together , so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components .
and this is one of those examples of the sets .
so , for me , what was important is that this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot , a teapot , and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- that they would have a coherence -- so , they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots -- but that everyone who bought one would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way .
to go back to architecture , what 's organic about architecture as a field , unlike product design , is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm . like , we have to design things which are coherent as a single object , but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale .
architects tend to work with signature , so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to , say , skyscrapers , and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with ; and intricacy , which is the relationship of , say , the shape of a building , its structure , its windows , its color , its pattern . these are real architectural problems .
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .
i got interested in them because they 're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let 's call it the decoration -- i know the frog doesn 't think of it as decoration , but that 's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another .
so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern .
so , the pattern and the form aren 't the same thing , but they really work together and are fused in some way .
so , when doing a center for the national parks in costa rica , we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building .
we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum , so it 's all one continuous change in the massing , but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms .
in a housing project in valencia , spain , we 're doing , the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass , like a kind of monolith , but it breaks down into individual elements .
and you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size , but always within a , kind of , controlled limit , an envelope of change .
i work with a group of other architects .
we have a company called united architects .
we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design .
and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction .
we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site .
and to do that , we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .
and we looked at , from the 1950s on , there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing .
we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building , where we could build these five separate towers , but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass .
with united architects , also , we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system , but this time in a much more monolithic mass , like a sphere .
but again , you can see this , kind of , organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole , but breaks down into smaller parts , but in an incredibly organic way .
finally , i 'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication .
about six years ago , i bought one of these cnc mills , to just replace , kind of , young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models .
and i also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop , kind of , large-scale building elements and models , where we could go directly to the tooling .
what i found out is that the tooling , if you intervened in the software , actually produced decorative effects .
so , for these interiors , like this shop in stockholm , sweden , or this installation wall in the netherlands at the netherlands architecture institute , we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects , and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .
so , in vacuum-formed plastic , in fiberglass , and then even at the level of structural steel , which you think of as being linear and modular .
the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient , but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic .
thanks very much .

paul ewald asks , can we domesticate germs ?
what i 'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter , and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea .
and in particular , i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .
and when evolutionary biologists talk about design , they really mean design by natural selection .
and that brings me to the title of the talk , " using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently . "
and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this .
but i 'm not just doing this to be cute .
i really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me , who 's sort of a darwin wannabe , how they actually look at one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine .
it 's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists .
you actually see a great potential , but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf , and may actually be very resistant , when one tries to introduce ideas .
so , all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions .
one is that , why are some disease organisms more harmful ? and a very closely related question , which is , how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question ?
how can we make the harmful organisms more mild ?
and i 'm going to be talking , to begin with , as i said , about diarrheal disease organisms .
and the focus when i 'm talking about the diarrheal organisms , as well as the focus when i 'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease , is to think about the problem from a germ 's point of view ,
germ 's-eye view .
and in particular , to think about a fundamental idea which i think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms .
and that idea is that from the germ 's-eye point of view , disease organisms have to get from one host to another , and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host .
but not always .
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don 't rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
and when you have that , then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative , more predator-like organisms .
so , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility , then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .
so , if the pathogen doesn 't need the host to be healthy and active , and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts , the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success .
but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen , then it 's the benign ones that tend to be the winners .
so , i 'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases .
diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways .
they can be transmitted from person-to-person contact , person-to-food-then-to-person contact , when somebody eats contaminated food ,
or they can be transmitted through the water .
and when they 're transmitted through the water , unlike the first two modes of transmission , these pathogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission .
a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens , even hundreds of other individuals .
to sort of illustrate that , this diagram emphasizes that if you 've got a sick person in bed , somebody 's going to be taking out the contaminated materials .
they 're going to wash those contaminated materials , and then the water may move into sources of drinking water .
people will come in to those places where you 've got contaminated drinking water , bring things back to the family , may drink right at that point .
the whole point is that a person who can 't move can still infect many other individuals .
and so , the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water , we expect them to be more predator-like , more harmful .
and you can test these ideas .
so , one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria , and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water , tend to be more harmful .
and the answer is -- yep , they are .
now i put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs , but the main point here is that -- there 's a lot of them here , i can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong , positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water , and how harmful they are , how much death they cause per untreated infection .
so this suggests we 're on the right track .
but this , to me , suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions .
remember the second question that i raised at the outset was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild ?
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
but it doesn 't tell you how long .
i mean , if this would require thousands of years , then it 's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens .
but if it could occur in just a few years , then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven 't been able to control .
in other words , this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms .
we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us .
and so , as i was thinking about this , i focused on this organism , which is the el tor biotype of the organism called vibrio cholerae .
and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera .
and the reason i thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful .
it 's harmful because it produces a toxin ,
and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract .
it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen , the internal chamber of our intestine , and then that fluid goes the only way it can , which is out the other end .
and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios .
so what happens , if you 've got an organism , it produces a lot of toxin . after a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn 't so disgusting as we might imagine .
it 's sort of cloudy water .
and if you took a drop of that water , you might find a million diarrheal organisms .
if the organism produced a lot of toxin , you might find 10 million , or 100 million .
if it didn 't produce a lot of this toxin , then you might find a smaller number .
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission , thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact , or person-food-person contact --
both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .
now , i can think of some possible experiments .
one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins , some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .
some countries that might have clean water supplies , so that you can 't get waterborne transmission : you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there .
other countries , in which you 've got a lot of waterborne transmission , there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness , right ?
there 's a little ethical problem in this experiment .
i was hoping to hear a few gasps at least .
that makes me worry a little bit .
but anyhow , the laughter makes me feel a little bit better .
and this ethical problem 's a big problem .
just to emphasize this , this is what we 're really talking about .
here 's a girl who 's almost dead .
she got rehydration therapy , she perked up , within a few days she was looking like a completely different person .
so , we don 't want to run an experiment like that .
but interestingly , just that thing happened in 1991 .
in 1991 , this cholera organism got into lima , peru , and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas .
now , i don 't know how that happened , and i didn 't have anything to do with it , i promise you .
i don 't think anybody knows , but i 'm not averse to , once that 's happened , to see whether or not the prediction that we would make , that i did make before , actually holds up .
did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like chile , which has some of the most well protected water supplies in latin america ?
and did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like ecuador , which has some of the least well protected ?
and peru 's got something sort of in between .
and so , with funding from the bosack-kruger foundation , i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab .
and we found that in chile -- within two months of the invasion of peru you had strains entering chile --
and when you look at those strains , in the very far left-hand side of this graph , you see a lot of variation in the toxin production .
each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act .
but the interesting point is , if you look over the 1990s , within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild .
they evolved to produce less toxin . and to just give you a sense of how important this might be , if we look in 1995 , we find that there 's only one case of cholera , on average , reported from chile every two years .
so , it 's controlled .
that 's how much we have in america , cholera that 's acquired endemically ,
and we don 't think we 've got a problem here .
they didn 't -- they solved the problem in chile .
but , before we get too confident , we 'd better look at some of those other countries , and make sure that this organism doesn 't just always evolve toward mildness .
well , in peru it didn 't .
and in ecuador -- remember , this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission -- it looked like it got more harmful .
in every case there 's a lot of variation , but something about the environment the people are living in , and i think the only realistic explanation is that it 's the degree of waterborne transmission , favored the harmful strains in one place , and mild strains in another .
so , this is very encouraging , it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow , if we had enough money , could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck .
it would make these organisms evolve to mildness , so that even though people might be getting infected , they 'd be infected with mild strains .
it wouldn 't be causing severe disease .
but there 's another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence , evolution of harmfulness , then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance .
and the idea is very simple .
if you 've got a harmful organism , a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic , a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics .
you 've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance , so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance .
and once you get increased antibiotic resistance , the antibiotics aren 't knocking out the harmful strains anymore .
so , you 've got a higher level of virulence .
so , you get this vicious cycle .
the goal is to turn this around .
if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply , you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .
so , we can go to the same countries and look and see .
did chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance ,
whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem ?
if we look in the beginning of the 1990s , we see , again , a lot of variation .
in this case , on the y-axis , we 've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --
and i won 't go into that .
but we 've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in chile , peru and ecuador , and no trend across the years .
but if we look at the end of the 1990s , just half a decade later , we see that in ecuador they started having a resistance problem .
antibiotic sensitivity was going down .
and in chile , you still had antibiotic sensitivity .
so , it looks like chile dodged two bullets .
they got the organism to evolve to mildness , and they got no development of antibiotic resistance .
now , these ideas should apply across the board ,
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence .
and i want to give you just one more example , because we 've talked a little bit about malaria .
and the example i want to deal with is , or the idea i want to deal with , the question is , what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness ?
now , malaria 's transmitted by a mosquito , and normally if you 're infected with malaria , and you 're feeling sick , it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you .
and you can show , just by looking at data from literature , that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases .
but i think there 's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this .
in the case of waterborne transmission , we 'd like to clean up the water supplies , see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness .
in the case of malaria , what we 'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .
and the logic 's a little more subtle here .
if you mosquito-proof houses , when people get sick , they 're sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals , they 're sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can 't get to them .
so , if you 're a harmful variant in a place where you 've got mosquito-proof housing , then you 're a loser .
the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .
so , if you were to mosquito proof houses , you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness .
and there 's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this .
and that experiment was done in northern alabama .
just to give you a little perspective on this , i 've given you a star at the intellectual center of the united states , which is right there in louisville , kentucky .
and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there , in northern alabama , by the tennessee valley authority .
they had dammed up the tennessee river .
they 'd caused the water to back up , they needed electric , hydroelectric power .
and when you get stagnant water , you get mosquitoes .
they found in the late ' 30s -- 10 years after they 'd made these dams -- that the people in northern alabama were infected with malaria ,
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria .
this shows you the positions of some of these dams .
ok , so the tennessee valley authority was in a little bit of a bind .
there wasn 't ddt , there wasn 't chloroquines : what do they do ?
well , they decided to mosquito proof every house in northern alabama .
so they did . they divided northern alabama into 11 zones , and within three years , about 100 dollars per house , they mosquito proofed every house .
and these are the data .
every row across here represents one of those 11 zones .
and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete .
and so what you can see is that just the mosquito-proofed housing , and nothing else , caused the eradication of malaria .
and this was , incidentally , published in 1949 , in the leading textbook of malaria , called " boyd 's malariology . "
but almost no malaria experts even know it exists .
this is important , because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities , you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses .
now , i would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places .
like , you know , just as you get into the malaria zone , sub-saharan africa .
but as you move to really intense biting rate areas , like nigeria , you 're certainly not going to eradicate .
but that 's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness .
so to me , it 's an experiment that 's waiting to happen , and if it confirms the prediction , then we should have a very powerful tool .
in a way , much more powerful than the kind of tools we 're looking at ,
because most of what 's being done today is to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs .
and we know that , although it 's great to make those anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency , we know that when you make them highly available you 're going to get resistance to those drugs .
and so it 's a short-term solution .
this is a long-term solution .
what i 'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go ,
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen , for example with anti-malarial drugs .
so , this table i 've given just to emphasize that i 've only talked about two examples .
but as i said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
because when we 're dealing with infectious diseases , we 're dealing with living systems .
we 're dealing with living systems ; we 're dealing with systems that evolve .
and so if you do something with those systems , they 're going to evolve one way or another .
and all i 'm saying is that we need to figure out how they 'll evolve , so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck , so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go .
so , i don 't really have time to talk about those things , but i did want to put them up there , just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we 're confronted with .
and this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about .
so , for example , earlier today there was discussion of , how do you really lower sexual transmission of hiv ?
what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work .
will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area ?
it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners , and so on .
but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it , because if we lower it , we 'll get an evolutionary change in the virus .
and the data really do support this : that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .
and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts .
so the other thing i really like about this , besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease , is that often the kinds of interventions that you want , that it indicates should be done , are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow .
but people just haven 't been able to justify the cost .
so , this is the kind of thing i 'm talking about .
if we know that we 're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water , then i think that we can say , let 's push the effort into that aspect of the control , so that we can actually solve the problem , even though , if you just look at the frequency of infection , you would suggest that you can 't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply .
anyhow , i 'll end that there , and thank you very much .

todd kuiken : a prosthetic arm that " feels "
so today , i would like to talk with you about bionics , which is the popular term for the science of replacing part of a living organism with a mechatronic device , or a robot .
it is essentially the stuff of life meets machine .
and specifically , i 'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations .
this is our motivation .
arm amputation causes a huge disability .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
our hands are amazing instruments .
and when you lose one , far less both , it 's a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do .
there 's also a huge emotional impact .
and actually , i spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability .
and finally , there 's a profound social impact .
we talk with our hands .
we greet with our hands .
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
and when they 're missing , it 's a barrier .
arm amputation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle collisions or , very poignantly , war .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called congenital limb deficiency .
unfortunately , we don 't do great with upper-limb prosthetics .
there are two general types .
they 're called body-powered prostheses , which were invented just after the civil war , refined in world war i and world war ii .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
it 's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
so when you squish your shoulders , they pull on a bicycle cable .
and that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow .
and we still use them commonly , because they 're very robust and relatively simple devices .
the state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses .
these are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle .
every time you contract a muscle , it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .
they work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand , because your hand muscles are still there .
you squeeze your hand , these muscles contract .
you open it , these muscles contract .
so it 's intuitive , and it works pretty well .
well how about with higher levels of amputation ?
now you 've lost your arm above the elbow .
you 're missing not only these muscles , but your hand and your elbow too .
what do you do ?
well our patients have to use very code-y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs .
we have robotic limbs .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
they contain just a hand that will open and close , a wrist rotator and an elbow .
there 's no other functions .
if they did , how would we tell them what to do ?
we built our own arm at the rehab institute of chicago where we 've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
and we 've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u.s. military , using these prototypes , that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including movable hands .
but at the end of the day , how do we tell these robotic arms what to do ?
how do we control them ?
well we need a neural interface , a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it 's intuitive , it 's natural , like for you and i .
well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain , going down your spinal cord , out the nerves and to your periphery .
and your sensation 's the exact opposite .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain .
when you lose your arm , that nervous system still works .
those nerves can put out command signals .
and if i tap the nerve ending on a world war ii vet , he 'll still feel his missing hand .
so you might say , let 's go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals , or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it 's really , really hard .
you have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts .
and it 's just too hard to use now and for my patients today .
so we developed a different approach .
we 're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles .
muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand-fold , so that we can record them from on top of the skin , like you saw earlier .
so our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation .
imagine , with somebody who 's lost their whole arm , we still have four major nerves that go down your arm .
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .
now you think , " close hand , " and a little section of your chest contracts .
you think , " bend elbow , " a different section contracts .
and we can use electrodes or antennae to pick that up and tell the arm to move .
that 's the idea .
so this is the first man that we tried it on .
his name is jesse sullivan .
he 's just a saint of a man -- 54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder .
jesse came to us at the ric to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices , and here you see them .
i 'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side .
and he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches .
on the left side he 's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints , and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go .
and jesse 's a good crane operator , and he did okay by our standards .
he also required a revision surgery on his chest .
and that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation .
so my colleague , dr. greg dumanian , did the surgery . first , we cut away the nerve to his own muscle , then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up .
and after about three months , the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch .
and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
and this is what it looks like .
this is what happens when jesse thinks open and close his hand , or bend or straighten your elbow .
you can see the movements on his chest , and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae , or electrodes .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
his brain is thinking about his arm .
he has not learned how to do this with the chest .
there is not a learning process .
that 's why it 's intuitive .
so here 's jesse in our first little test with him .
on the left-hand side , you see his original prosthesis , and he 's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other .
he 's had that arm for about 20 months , so he 's pretty good with it .
on the right side , two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis -- which , by the way , is the same physical arm , just programmed a little different -- you can see that he 's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks .
and we 're only able to use three of the signals at this time .
then we had one of those little surprises in science .
so we 're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms .
and after a few months , you touch jesse on his chest , and he felt his missing hand .
his hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat , so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated , if you would , his skin .
so you touch jesse here , he feels his thumb ; you touch it here , he feels his pinky .
he feels light touch down to one gram of force .
he feels hot , cold , sharp , dull , all in his missing hand , or both his hand and his chest , but he can attend to either .
so this is really exciting for us , because now we have a portal , a portal , or a way to potentially give back sensation , so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .
imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin .
so it was very exciting .
we 've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .
and here we deinnervate , or cut the nerve away , just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up-down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal .
this was one of our first patients , chris .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
he 's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric .
all right .
so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators .
and we 're fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join us .
please welcome amanda kitts .
so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
amanda kitts : sure . in 2006 , i had a car accident .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lane , ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off .
todd kuiken : okay , so after your amputation , you healed up .
and you 've got one of these conventional arms .
can you tell us how it worked ?
ak : well , it was a little difficult , because all i had to work with was a bicep and a tricep .
so for the simple little things like picking something up , i would have to bend my elbow , and then i would have to cocontract to get it to change modes .
when i did that , i had to use my bicep to get the hand to close , use my tricep to get it to open , cocontract again to get the elbow to work again . tk : so it was a little slow ?
ak : a little slow , and it was just hard to work . you had to concentrate a whole lot .
tk : okay , so i think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery , took six more months to have all the reinnervation .
then we fit her with a prosthesis .
and how did that work for you ?
ak : it works good .
i was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
so i didn 't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
tk : a little faster ?
ak : a little faster . and much more easy , much more natural .
tk : okay , this was my goal .
for 20 years , my goal was to let somebody [ be ] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the u.s. armed services .
the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high .
because we 're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle .
and it provides intuitive control .
our functional testing , those little tests , all show that they 're a lot quicker and a lot easier .
and the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it .
so that was all very exciting .
but we want to do better .
there 's a lot of information in those nerve signals , and we wanted to get more .
you can move each finger . you can move your thumb , your wrist .
can we get more out of it ?
so we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks -- from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something -- and recorded this data .
and then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms ,
called pattern recognition .
see .
and here you can see , on jesse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
but i can 't put in an electrode and say , " go there . "
so we collaborated with our colleagues in university of new brunswick , came up with this algorithm control , which amanda can now demonstrate .
ak : so i have the elbow that goes up and down .
i have the wrist rotation that goes -- and it can go all the way around .
and i have the wrist flexion and extension .
and i also have the hand closed and open .
tk : thank you , amanda .
now this is a research arm , but it 's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that i 've borrowed from around the world .
it 's about seven pounds , which is probably about what my arm would weigh if i lost it right here .
obviously , that 's heavy for amanda .
and in fact , it feels even heavier , because it 's not glued on the same .
she 's carrying all the weight through harnesses .
so the exciting part isn 't so much the mechatronics , but the control .
so we 've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals .
so amanda , when you first started using this arm , how long did it take to use it ?
ak : it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .
i had to hook it up to a computer , so i couldn 't just train it anywhere .
so if it stopped working , i just had to take it off .
so now it 's able to train with just this little piece on the back .
i can wear it around .
if it stops working for some reason , i can retrain it .
takes about a minute .
tk : so we 're really excited , because now we 're getting to a clinically practical device . and that 's where our goal is -- to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
we 've also had amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that i showed you earlier .
here 's amanda using an arm made by deka research corporation .
and i believe dean kamen presented it at ted a few years ago .
so amanda , you can see , has really good control .
it 's all the pattern recognition .
and it now has a hand that can do different grasps .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , " what hand grasp pattern do i want ? "
it goes into that mode , and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand .
amanda , how many were you able to do with the deka arm ?
ak : i was able to get four .
i had the key grip , i had a chuck grip , i had a power grasp and i had a fine pinch .
but my favorite one was just when the hand was open , because i work with kids , and so all the time you 're clapping and singing , so i was able to do that again , which was really good .
tk : that hand 's not so good for clapping .
ak : can 't clap with this one .
tk : all right . so that 's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
i want you to watch closely .
claudia : oooooh !
tk : that 's claudia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .
she had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces , and she could feel different textures of sandpaper , different grits , ribbon cable , as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin .
she said that when she just ran it across the table , it felt like her finger was rocking .
so that 's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back , potentially , some skin sensation .
but here 's another video that shows some of our challenges .
this is jesse , and he 's squeezing a foam toy .
and the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle that 's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes .
but look at all the electrodes around it .
i 've got a real estate problem .
you 're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there , but our little motor 's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes .
so we 're really challenged on what we 're doing there .
the future is bright .
we 're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do .
so for example , one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals .
we want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals , so that it 's not worrying about electrode contact .
and we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback .
we want to build a better arm .
this arm -- they 're always made for the 50th percentile male -- which means they 're too big for five-eighths of the world .
so rather than a super strong or super fast arm , we 're making an arm that is -- we 're starting with , the 25th percentile female -- that will have a hand that wraps around , opens all the way , two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow .
so it 'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made .
once we can do it that small , it 's a lot easier making them bigger .
so those are just some of our goals .
and we really appreciate you all being here today .
i 'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side , with yesterday 's theme .
so amanda came jet-lagged , she 's using the arm , there was a computer spook , a broken wire , a converter that sparked .
we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
and thankfully dr. annie simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it .
that 's science .
and fortunately , it worked today .
so thank you very much .

it 's an all too common story : after participating in an hiv clinical trial , a woman in sub-saharan africa is left without the resources to buy a bus ticket to her health clinic , let alone to afford life-saving antiretrovirals . boghuma kabisen titanji asks an important question : how can researchers looking for a cure make sure they 're not taking advantage of those most affected by the pandemic ?

boghuma kabisen titanji : ethical riddles in hiv research
i 'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine .
celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa . six years ago , at the time of her hiv diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time .
when i first met celine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy , and she was very ill .
she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance .
now during the clinical trial , she 'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving celine with no alternatives . she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about .
i didn 't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue .
yet what puzzled me most was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed .
now , i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of hiv patients .
but it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who , like celine , were left to their own devices once the research had been completed .
i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally-funded research .
sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research .
i 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub-saharan africa , so attractive for these hiv clinical trials ?
well , in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results , they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new hiv infections .
sub-saharan africa largely fits this description , with 22 million people living with hiv , an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide .
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems .
a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized , and in the absence of good health care systems , almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing .
even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation , less rigorous ethical reviews , and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure .
as funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict , you can see why this context becomes very , very attractive .
the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable .
how then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ?
i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done .
the first of these is informed consent .
now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
this is especially important in developing countries , where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits .
consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats .
the second point i would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial .
now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy . should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world ?
or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ?
is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed ?
now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial , and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study .
that brings us to the third point i want you think about : the ethical review of research .
an effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial .
unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries , and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors .
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
the final point i would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended .
now , researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed .
in addition , they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends .
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
now , fortunately for celine , our meeting did not end in my office .
i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program closer to her home , and with a support group to help her cope .
her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate .
although she may not know this , my encounter with celine has completely changed the way in which i view hiv clinical trials in developing countries , and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done .
i believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change .
if you are a researcher , i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience , to remain ethical in your research , and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers .
if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company , i challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound .
if you come from a developing country like myself , i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country .
yes , there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv , to find an effective vaccine for malaria , to find a diagnostic tool that works for t.b. , but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way .
thank you .

when i came to the galapagos 40 years ago , there were 3,000 people that lived in the galapagos .
now there are over 30,000 .
there were two jeeps on santa cruz .
now , there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there .
so the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people .
it 's the same problems in the galapagos , except , obviously , it 's worse here , in some ways , than other places .
because we 've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --
but we have 6.7 billion people in the world ,
and we all like to consume .
and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback .
we 're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
and when i came at age 22 to live on fernandina , let me just say , that i had never camped before .
i had never lived alone for any period of time ,
and i 'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night .
but moreover , i 'd never lived on an uninhabited island .
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year ,
and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there . but it 's alive with life ;
it 's hardly uninhabited .
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years ,
and what i learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wildlife , and the amazing qualities that penguins have .
penguins are real athletes :
they can swim 173 kilometers in a day .
they can swim at the same speed day and night --
that 's faster than any olympic swimmer .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
but what is really amazing , because of this deepness here , emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters
and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes .
magellanic penguins , the ones that i work on , they can dive to about 90 meters and they can stay down for about 4.6 minutes .
humans , without fins : 90 meters , 3.5 minutes . and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes .
you have to train to be able to do that .
so penguins are amazing athletes .
the other thing is , i 've never met anybody that really doesn 't say that they like penguins .
they 're comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they 're diligent .
and , more importantly , they 're well-dressed .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
but scientifically , they 're amazing because they 're sentinels .
they tell us about our world in a lot of different ways , and particularly the ocean .
this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that 's on the front of a little zodiac here in the galapagos .
and that 's what i came to study .
i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins , but you already know penguins are rare .
these are the rarest penguins in the world .
why i thought i was going to be able to do that , i don 't know .
but the population has changed dramatically since i was first here .
when i counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census , we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands .
we counted around 2,000 , so i don 't know how many penguins there really are , but i know i can count 2,000 .
if you go and do it now , the national parks count about 500 .
so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago .
and this is true of most of our living systems .
we have less than we had before , and most of them are in fairly steep decline .
and i want to just show you a little bit about why .
that 's a penguin braying to tell you that it 's important to pay attention to penguins .
most important of all , i didn 't know what that was the first time i heard it .
and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome , plaintful call .
i fell in love with penguins , and it certainly has changed the rest of my life .
what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes , the most extreme variation .
you 've heard about these el ninos , but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to .
this is a cold-water event called la nina .
where it 's blue and it 's green , it means the water is really cold .
and so you can see this current coming up -- in this case , the humboldt current -- that comes all the way out to the galapagos islands ,
and this deep undersea current , the cromwell current , that upwells around the galapagos .
that brings all the nutrients :
when this is cold in the galapagos , it 's rich , and there 's plenty of food for everyone .
when we have extreme el nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the galapagos .
that means that there 's no upwelling , and there 's basically no food .
so it 's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
things die when there 's no food .
but we didn 't even know that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins .
and you can imagine being on an island hoping you 're going to see penguins , and you 're in the middle of an el nino event and there are no penguins .
they 're not breeding ; they 're not even around .
i studied marine iguanas at that point .
but this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
and if you look along the coast of argentina , where i work now , at a place called punta tombo -- the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there 's great variation here .
some years , the cold water goes all the way up to brazil , and other years , in these la nina years , it doesn 't .
so the oceans don 't always act together ; they act differently , but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with , and it 's not easy .
so when i went to study the magellanic penguins , i didn 't have any problems .
there were plenty of them .
this is a picture at punta tombo in february showing all the penguins along the beach .
i went there because the japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves , protein and oil .
fortunately , nobody has harvested any penguins and we 're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them .
but the population is declining
and it 's declined fairly substantially , about 21 percent since 1987 , when i started these surveys , in terms of number of active nests .
here , you can see where punta tombo is ,
and they breed in incredibly dense colonies .
we know this because of long-term science , because we have long-term studies there .
and science is important in informing decision makers , and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in .
and so we have this penguin project . the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
and also , we know that it 's not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble , but magellanics and many other species of penguins .
and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .
this is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
penguins don 't like oil and they don 't like to swim through oil .
the nice thing is , if you look down here in argentina , there 's no surface oil pollution from this composite map .
but , in fact , when we went to argentina , penguins were often found totally covered in oil .
so they were just minding their own business .
they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .
because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point , so when they 're empty , they have the ballast water in there .
when they come back , they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean .
why do they do that ? because it 's cheaper , because they don 't pay the real environmental costs .
we usually don 't , and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost .
at first , the argentine government said , " no , there 's no way .
you can 't find oiled penguins in argentina .
we have laws ,
and we can 't have illegal dumping ; it 's against the law . "
so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .
in some years , like this year , we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil .
these little blue dots are the fledglings -- we do this survey every march -- which means that they 're only in the environment from january until march , so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil .
and you can see , in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled .
eventually , the government listened and , amazingly , they changed their laws .
they moved the tanker lanes 40 kilometers farther off shore , and people are not doing as much illegal dumping .
so what we 're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled .
why are there even these penguins oiled ?
because we 've solved the problem in chubut province , which is like a state in argentina where punta tombo is -- so that 's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline -- but we haven 't solved the problem in northern argentina , uruguay and brazil .
so now i want to show you that penguins are affected .
i 'm just going to talk about two things .
this is climate change . now this has really been a fun study because i put satellite tags on the back of these magellanic penguins .
try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins .
but we 've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go .
we thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers , and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin . and what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins ' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 --
and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs , the other one is out there foraging ,
and the longer they have to stay gone , the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back .
and , of course , all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can 't raise a lot of chicks .
here you see in 2003 -- these are all the dots of where the penguins are -- they were raising a little over a half of a chick .
here , you can see in 2006 , they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest ,
and you can see that they 're closer to punta tombo ; they 're not going as far away .
this past year , in 2009 , you can see that they 're now raising about a fourth of a chick ,
and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests .
so it 's kind of like you having a job in chicago , and then you get transferred to st. louis , and your mate is not happy about this because you 've got to pay airfare , because you 're gone longer .
the same thing 's true for penguins as well .
and they 're going about , on average now , 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago .
we need to be able to get information out to the general public .
and so we started a publication with the society for conservation that we think presents cutting-edge science in a new , novel way , because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public .
so if you 're interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation , you should join with our 11 partners -- some of them here in this room , like the nature conservancy -- and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public .
lastly i want to say that all of you , probably , have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog , a cat , some sort of pet , and you recognized that those are individuals .
and some of you consider them almost part of your family .
if you had a relationship with a penguin , you 'd see it in the same sort of way .
they 're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they 're not that different from us :
they 're trying to make a living ,
they 're trying to raise their offspring ,
they 're trying to get on and survive in the world .
this is turbo the penguin .
turbo 's never been fed .
he met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck : a turbo truck , so we named him turbo .
turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak ,
we let him in and he comes in here .
and i just wanted to show you what happened one day when turbo brought in a friend .
so this is turbo .
he 's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting , which he would do to a female penguin .
and you can see , he 's not trying to bite .
this guy has never been in before and he 's trying to figure out , " what is going on ?
what is this guy doing ?
this is really pretty weird . "
and you 'll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see , turbo 's pretty intent on his flipper patting .
and now he 's looking at the other guy , saying , " you are really weird . "
and now look at this : not friendly .
so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats .
we 're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate .
so we 're trying to put that in computers in the field .
and penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another .
this is a radio frequency id system .
you put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode , so it tells you who it is .
it walks over the pad , and you know who it is .
okay , so here are a few penguins coming in .
see , this one 's coming back to its nest .
they 're all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in .
here 's a female that 's in a hurry . she 's got food .
she 's really rushing back , because it 's hot , to try to feed her chicks .
and then there 's another fellow that will leisurely come by .
look how fat he is . he 's walking back to feed his chicks .
then i realize that they 're playing king of the box .
this is my box up here , and this is the system that works .
you can see this penguin , he goes over , he looks at those wires , does not like that wire .
he unplugs the wire ; we have no data .
so , they really are pretty amazing creatures .
ok .
most important thing is : only you can change yourself ,
and only you can change the world and make it better , for people as well as penguins .

parag khanna maps the future of countries
do we live in a borderless world ?
before you answer that , have a look at this map .
contemporary political map shows that we have over 200 countries in the world today .
that 's probably more than at any time in centuries .
now , many of you will object .
for you this would be a more appropriate map .
you could call it tedistan .
in tedistan , there are no borders , just connected spaces and unconnected spaces .
most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots on this screen , of the many more that represent 90 percent of the world economy .
but let 's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violently .
now here at ted , we 're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe .
well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved : our basic political geography .
how do we distribute ourselves around the world ?
now this is important , because border conflicts justify so much of the world 's military-industrial complex .
border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here .
so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people , money , power , religion , culture , technology interact to change the map of the world .
and we can try to anticipate those changes , and shape them in a more constructive direction .
so we 're going to look at some maps of the past , the present and some maps you haven 't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going .
let 's start with the world of 1945 .
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world .
after world war ii , europe was devastated , but still held large overseas colonies : french west africa , british east africa , south asia , and so forth .
then over the late ' 40s , ' 50s , ' 60s , ' 70s and ' 80s , waves of decolonization took place .
over 50 new countries were born .
you can see that africa has been fragmented .
india , pakistan , bangladesh , south east asian nations created .
then came the end of the cold war .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
you had the creation of new states in eastern europe , the former yugoslav republics and the balkans , and the ' stans of central asia .
today we have 200 countries in the world .
the entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
does that mean that someone 's gain has to be someone else 's loss ?
let 's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world , eastern eurasia .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
and as you know , china is the most populous .
and they share a lengthy land border .
what you don 't see on this map is that most of russia 's 150 million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to europe .
and only 30 million people are in its eastern areas .
in fact , the world bank predicts that russia 's population is declining towards about 120 million people and there is another thing that you don 't see on this map .
stalin , khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags , labor camps , nuclear cities , whatever the case was .
but as oil prices rose , russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country , east and west .
but nothing has more perversely impacted russia 's demographic distribution ,
because the people in the east , who never wanted to be there anyway , have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west .
as a result , in the russian far east today , which is twice the size of india , you have exactly six million russians .
so let 's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .
we can start with mongolia , or as some call it , mine-golia .
why do they call it that ?
because in mine-golia , chinese firms operate and own most of the mines -- copper , zinc , gold -- and they truck the resources south and east into mainland china .
china isn 't conquering mongolia . it 's buying it .
colonies were once conquered . today countries are bought .
so let 's apply this principle to siberia .
siberia most of you probably think of as a cold , desolate , unlivable place .
but in fact , with global warming and rising temperatures , all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness , and grain being produced in siberia .
but who is it going to feed ?
well , just on the other side of the amo river , in the heilongjiang and harbin provinces of china , you have over 100 million people .
that 's larger than the entire population of russia .
every single year , for at least a decade or more , [ 60,000 ] of them have been voting with their feet , crossing , moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain .
they set up their own bazaars and medical clinics .
they 've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east , back into china .
again , like mongolia , china isn 't conquering russia . it 's just leasing it .
that 's what i call globalization chinese style .
now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years .
but hold on . this map is 700 years old .
this is the map of the yuan dynasty , led by kublai khan , the grandson of genghis khan .
so history doesn 't necessarily repeat itself , but it does rhyme .
this is just to give you a taste of what 's happening in this part of the world .
again , globalization chinese style .
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography . so , the history of east asia in fact , people don 't think about nations and borders .
they think more in terms of empires and hierarchies , usually chinese or japanese .
well it 's china 's turn again .
so let 's look at how china is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far east .
it starts with the global hubs .
remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy ?
east asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world .
tokyo , seoul , beijing , shanghai , hong kong , singapore and sidney .
these are the filters and funnels of global capital .
trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region ,
so much of it being invested into china .
then there is trade .
these vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region .
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong allies of the united states .
australia , for example , is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to china .
for poorer countries , china reduces tariffs so that laos and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well .
and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound , the economic rebound , not just in asia , but potentially for the world .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that 's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .
another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
it has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community .
some of these organizations don 't even have the united states as a member .
there is a treaty of nonaggression between countries , such that if there were a conflict between china and the united states , most countries vow to just sit it out , including american allies like korea and australia .
another pillar of the strategy , like russia , is demographic .
china exports business people , nannies , students , teachers to teach chinese around the region , to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies .
already ethnic chinese people in malaysia , thailand and indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there .
chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result .
singapore , for example , used to ban chinese language education .
now it encourages it .
if you add it all up what do you get ?
well , if you remember before world war ii , japan had a vision for a greater japanese co-prosperity sphere .
what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese co-prosperity sphere .
so no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders , what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures , but in a much more fluid , imperial zone .
all of this is happening without firing a shot .
that 's most certainly not the case in the middle east where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by european colonialists .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
what lines on the map should we focus on ?
what i want to present to you is what i call state building , day by day .
let 's start with iraq .
six years after the u.s. invasion of iraq , the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality .
oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country 's disintegration .
the reason is kurdistan .
the kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence ,
and now is their chance to finally have it .
these are pipeline routes , which emerge from kurdistan , which is an oil-rich region .
and today , if you go to kurdistan , you 'll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army .
but what are they guarding ?
is it really a border on the map ?
no . it 's the pipelines .
if the kurds can control their pipelines , they can set the terms of their own statehood .
now should we be upset about this , about the potential disintegration of iraq ?
i don 't believe we should .
iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world , behind saudi arabia .
and we 'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute .
now remember kurdistan is landlocked .
it has no choice but to behave .
in order to profit from its oil it has to export it through turkey or syria , and other countries , and iraq itself .
and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .
now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region . that is , of course , in palestine .
palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it 's two parts palestinian , one part israel .
30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict .
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
today donors are spending billions of dollars on this .
these two arrows are an arc , an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza .
if gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the west bank , you can have a viable palestinian state , palestinian economy .
that , i believe , is going to bring peace to this particular conflict .
the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone , without infrastructure , is futile .
now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders , when the insecurities might abate ?
the last time that was the case was actually a century ago , during the ottoman empire . this is the hejaz railway .
the hejaz railway ran from istanbul to medina via damascus . it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters , ruins .
if we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map , infrastructure , that cross the straight lines , the borders , i believe the middle east would be a far more peaceful region .
now let 's look at another part of the world , the former soviet republics of central asia , the ' stans .
these countries ' borders originate from stalin 's decrees .
he purposely did not want these countries to make sense .
he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule .
fortunately for them , most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the soviet union collapsed .
now i know some of you may be thinking , " oil , oil , oil .
why is it all he 's talking about is oil ? "
well , there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we 're talking about it now .
before it was , how do we control their oil ?
now it 's their oil for their own purposes .
and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists .
here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades .
a great deal of them .
for a number of countries in this part of the world , having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves .
just take azerbaijan .
azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the caucuses ,
but now with the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline into turkey , it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west .
then there is turkmenistan , which most people think of as a frozen basket case .
but now it 's contributing gas across the caspian sea to provide for europe , and even a potentially turkmen- afghan-pakistan-india pipeline as well .
then there is kazakhstan , which didn 't even have a name before .
it was more considered south siberia during the soviet union .
today most people recognize kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player . why ?
because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the caspian , north through russia , and even east to china .
more pipelines means more silk roads , instead of the great game .
the great game connotes dominance of one over the other .
silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
the more pipelines we have , the more silk roads we 'll have , and the less of a dominant great game competition we 'll have in the 21st century .
now let 's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders , and how that has enhanced its strength .
and that is , of course , europe .
the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries ,
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of germany to happen in a peaceful way .
but then eventually it grew into 12 countries ,
and those are the 12 stars on the european flag .
the e.u. also became a currency block , and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world .
on average , the e.u. has grown by one country per year since the end of the cold war .
in fact most of that happened on just one day .
in 2004 , 15 new countries joined the e.u .
and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people .
so what is next ? what is the future of the european union ?
well in light blue , you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the european union for trade and investment .
what does that tell us ? trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is .
even if these regions aren 't part of the e.u. , they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .
just take the balkans . croatia , serbia bosnia , they 're not members of the e.u. yet .
but you can get on a german ice train and make it almost to albania .
in bosnia you use the euro currency already , and that 's the only currency they 're probably ever going to have .
so , looking at other parts of europe 's periphery , such as north africa .
on average , every year or two , a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the mediterranean , connecting north africa to europe .
that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy , but if you travel to north africa today , you 'll hear more and more people saying that they don 't really think of their region as the middle east .
so in other words , i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union .
now let 's look at turkey and the caucasus .
i mentioned azerbaijan before .
that corridor of turkey and the caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of europe 's energy supply .
so does turkey really have to be a member of the european union ?
i don 't think it does . i think it 's already part of a euro-turkish superpower .
so what 's next ? where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?
well , south central asia , south west asia is a very good place to start .
eight years after the u.s. invaded afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability .
pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism .
this is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million pashtuns who live on both sides of the afghan and pakistan border .
let 's not neglect the insurgency just to the south ,
balochistan . two weeks ago , balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison , and this was the flag that they raised over it .
the post-colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating ,
and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment .
of course , we can 't forget africa .
53 countries , and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map .
if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more , tribal divisions and so forth .
but let 's just look at sudan , the second-largest country in africa .
it has three ongoing civil wars , the genocide in darfur , which you all know about , the civil war in the east of the country , and south sudan .
south sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself independence .
now let 's go up to the arctic circle .
there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed .
who will win ? canada ? russia ? the united states ?
actually greenland .
several weeks ago greenland 's [ 60,000 ] people voted themselves self-governance rights from denmark .
so denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
what is the lesson from all of this ?
geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline . it 's constantly morphing and changing the world , like climate change .
and like our relationship with the ecosystem we 're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet .
now we fear changes on the map .
we fear civil wars , death tolls , having to learn the names of new countries .
but i believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent .
the question is how do we change those borders , and what lines do we focus on ?
i believe we focus on the lines that cross borders , the infrastructure lines . then we 'll wind up with the world we want , a borderless one .
thank you .

cynthia kenyon : experiments that hint of longer lives
have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging ?
this is a dream of the ages .
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .
now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
so that suggests that somewhere in these genes , somewhere in the dna , are genes for aging , genes that allow them to have different lifespans .
so if there are genes like that , then you can imagine that , if you could change one of the genes in an experiment , an aging gene , maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan .
and if you could do that , then you could find the genes for aging .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging .
and we didn 't study any of these animals .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round worm called c. elegans , which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence .
and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm .
so you can see in black , after a month -- they 're very short-lived ; that 's why we like to study them for studies of aging -- in black , after a month , the normal worms are all dead .
but at that time , most of the mutant worms are still alive .
and it isn 't until twice as long that they 're all dead .
and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here .
so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age -- a young adult .
it 's quite a cute little fellow .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
is it miserable ? it doesn 't seem to be .
it 's active . you can 't tell the difference really .
and they can be completely fertile -- have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do .
now get out your handkerchiefs here .
you 're going to see , in just two weeks , the normal worms are old .
you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there .
but everything else is just lying there .
the animal 's clearly in the nursing home .
and if you look at the tissues of the animal , they 're starting to deteriorate .
you know , even if you 've never seen one of these little c. elegans -- which probably most of you haven 't seen one -- you can tell they 're old -- isn 't that interesting ?
so there 's something about aging that 's kind of universal .
and now here is the daf-2 mutant .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
it 's the same age , but it 's not in the nursing home ;
it 's going skiing .
this is what 's really cool : it 's aging more slowly .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
and when i tell people about this , they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 .
but it 's really more like this : let 's say you 're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you 're a bachelor and you 're dating people .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
and you 're in a restaurant , and you say , " well how old are you ? "
she says , " i 'm 60 . "
that 's what it 's like . and you would never know .
you would never know , until she told you .
okay .
so what is the daf-2 gene ?
well as you know , genes , which are part of the dna , they 're instructions to make a protein that does something .
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell .
so part of it is like a baseball glove .
part of it 's on the outside , and it 's catching the hormone as it comes by in green .
and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
i just told you that , if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell , that you get a receptor that doesn 't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging .
that 's what that arrow means .
it speeds up aging . it makes it go faster .
so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself , speeding up aging .
so this is altogether really , really interesting .
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes , and specifically by hormones .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
there 's lots of hormones . there 's testosterone , adrenalin .
you know about a lot of them .
these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
now you 've all heard of at least insulin .
insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time , but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about -- maybe they also affect aging .
and it 's looking like that 's the case .
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
and that is the case in flies .
if you change this hormone pathway in flies , they live longer .
and also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us .
so it 's an ancient pathway , because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals .
and also , the common precursor also gave rise to people .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
and there are hints of this .
so for example , there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city .
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 .
and these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted .
it damaged the gene .
so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age-related disease ?
as you age , you 're much more likely to get cancer , alzheimer 's disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it 's not as severe .
so it 's really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they 're still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
so it suggests that , if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans , maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
how could that work ?
well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage .
and the way that they 're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo .
so in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .
the receptor isn 't working as well .
under those conditions , the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it .
you see one gene . there are lots of genes actually that bind on foxo .
and it 's just sitting on one of them .
so foxo turns on a lot of genes .
and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes i call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly .
and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged .
dna repair genes are more active in these animals .
and the immune system is more active .
and many of these different genes , we 've shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .
so it 's really interesting .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
they have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage , which we think makes them live longer .
so what about the normal worm ?
well when the daf-2 receptor is active , then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the dna is .
so it can 't turn the genes on .
that 's how it works . that 's why we don 't see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
but what good is this for the worm ?
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment .
then they promote the uptake of nutrients .
you can store the food , use it for energy , grow , etc .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop -- for example , having limited food supply .
and that , we think , is registered by the animal as a danger signal , a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity .
so it activates foxo , foxo goes to the dna , and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself .
and that 's why we think the animals live longer .
so you can think of foxo as being like a building superintendent .
so maybe he 's a little bit lazy , but he 's there , he 's taking care of the building .
but it 's deteriorating .
and then suddenly , he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane .
so he doesn 't actually do anything himself .
he gets on the telephone -- just like foxo gets on the dna -- and he calls up the roofer , the window person , the painter , the floor person .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
and then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in .
and not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there isn 't a hurricane .
so that 's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists .
now the really cool thing about foxo is that there are different forms of it .
we all have foxo genes , but we don 't all have exactly the same form of the foxo gene .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
and that 's the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , " okay , are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live a really long time ? " and there are .
we don 't know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
so this is really exciting to me .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases .
and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work .
there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
and for at least one of them , there is a drug .
there 's one called tor , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway .
and mutations that damage the tor gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice .
but in this case , there 's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it 's pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
now i don 't want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .
so this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer .
but still , here in the year 2011 , there 's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan , which comes out of this science that 's been done in all these different animals .
so i 'm really optimistic , and i think it won 't be too long , i hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true .
thank you .
matt ridley : thank you , cynthia .
let me get this straight . although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
so if you stop taking the drug , the protein would go back to normal .
you could change the genes in principle .
there isn 't the technology to do that .
but i don 't think that 's a good idea .
and the reason is that these hormones , like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway , they 're essential .
if you knock them out completely , then you 're very sick .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
and also , there are other ways of activating foxo that don 't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer .
mr : i wasn 't suggesting that i was going to go and do it , but ...
there 's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence .
there are some creatures on this planet already that don 't really do aging .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
ck : there are . there are some animals that don 't seem to age .
for example , there are some tortoises called blanding 's turtles .
and they grow to be about this size .
and they 've been tagged , and they 've been found to be 70 years old .
and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you can 't tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they 're better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year .
and there are other examples of these kinds of animals , like turns , certain kinds of birds are like this .
and nobody knows if they really can live forever , or what keeps them from aging .
it 's not clear .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and our long-lived mutants are too .
they 're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the worm , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don 't know .
mr : but what you 're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan .
ck : yes , that 's right .
it 's more like , say , if you were a dog .
you notice that you 're getting old , and you look at your human and you think , " why isn 't this human getting old ? "
they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan .
it 's more like that .
but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .

dave meslin : the antidote to apathy
how often do we hear that people just don 't care ?
how many times have you been told that real , substantial change isn 't possible because most people are too selfish , too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community ?
i propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn 't actually exist , but rather , that people do care , but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way .
and i 'll give you some examples of what i mean .
let 's start with city hall .
you ever see one of these before ?
this is a newspaper ad .
it 's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what 's happening .
as you can see , it 's impossible to read .
you need to get halfway down to even find out which address they 're talking about , and then farther down , in tiny 10-point font , to find out how to actually get involved .
imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that .
now that would never happen .
you 'll never see an ad like that because nike actually wants you to buy their shoes .
whereas the city of toronto clearly doesn 't want you involved with the planning process , otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly .
as long as the city 's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren 't going to be engaged .
but that 's not apathy ; that 's intentional exclusion .
public space .
the manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change
because we 've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice , dominating the visual and mental environment .
the problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren 't profitable to say .
so you 're never going to see them on a billboard .
the media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change , mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals ,
but even when they do talk about important political issues , they do it in a way that i feel discourages engagement .
and i 'll give you an example : the now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in toronto .
this is the cover story .
it 's an article about a theater performance , and it starts with basic information about where it is , in case you actually want to go and see it after you 've read the article -- where , the time , the website .
same with this -- it 's a movie review , an art review , a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go .
a restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant .
so they tell you where it is , what the prices are , the address , the phone number , etc . then you get to their political articles .
here 's a great article about an important election race that 's happening .
it talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information , no follow-up , no websites for the campaigns , no information about when the debates are , where the campaign offices are .
here 's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat , maybe read a book , maybe see a movie , but not be engaged in their community .
and you might think this is a small thing , but i think it 's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport .
heroes : how do we view leadership ?
look at these 10 movies . what do they have in common ?
anyone ?
they all have heroes who were chosen .
someone came up to them and said , " you 're the chosen one .
there 's a prophesy . you have to save the world . " and then someone goes off and saves the world because they 've been told to , with a few people tagging along .
this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders
because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
a heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
number two , it 's imperfect ; it 's not very glamorous , and it doesn 't suddenly start and suddenly end .
it 's an ongoing process your whole life .
but most importantly , it 's voluntary .
it 's voluntary .
as long as we 're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead , or someone tells you that you 're part of a prophecy , they 're missing the most important characteristic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
it 's about following your own dreams -- uninvited , uninvited -- and then working with others to make those dreams come true .
political parties : oh boy .
political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics .
instead , they 've become , sadly , uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing , pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas .
and people can smell that , and it feeds cynicism .
charitable status : groups who have charitable status in canada aren 't allowed to do advocacy . this is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced , especially during election time .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
as you may have noticed , our elections in canada are a complete joke .
we use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results .
canada 's currently led by a party that most canadians didn 't actually want .
how can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don 't count in canada ?
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
it 's like trying to run into a brick wall .
now i 'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what 's in our way .
quite the opposite : i actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care .
but that , as i said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
as long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are selfish , stupid or lazy , then there 's no hope .
but we can change all those things i mentioned .
we can open up city hall .
we can reform our electoral systems .
we can democratize our public spaces .
my main message is , if we can redefine apathy , not as some kind of internal syndrome , but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement , and if we can clearly define , we can clearly identify , what those obstacles are , and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles , then anything is possible .
thank you .

pioneering surgeon susan lim performed the first liver transplant in asia . but a moral concern with transplants led her to look further , and to ask : could we be transplanting cells , not whole organs ? at the ink conference , she talks through her new research , discovering healing cells in some surprising places .

susan lim : transplant cells , not organs
so i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers : thomas starzl , who performed the world 's first successful liver transplant in 1967 , and sir roy calne , who performed the first liver transplant in the u.k. in the following year .
i returned to singapore and , in 1990 , performed asia 's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure , but against all odds .
now when i look back , the transplant was actually the easiest part .
next , raising the money to fund the procedure .
but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country .
but 20 years on , my patient , surinder , is asia 's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date . and perhaps more important , i am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son .
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .
the truth is , there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
in the united states alone , 100,000 men , women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs , and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs .
the transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation .
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living , related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver graft , to a relative or loved one .
but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors .
and this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy .
how can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from , for example , a submissive spouse , an in-law , a servant , a slave , an employee ?
where and how can we draw the line ?
in my part of the world , too many people live below the poverty line .
and in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
shortly after i performed the first liver transplant , i received my next assignment , and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners .
i was also pregnant at the time .
pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life .
but my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison 's high-security death row , as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room .
and at each time , i would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners ' eyes follow me .
and for two years , i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 4 : 30 am on a friday morning , driving to the prison , getting down , gloved and scrubbed , ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner , remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon .
no doubt , i was informed , the consent had been obtained .
but , in my life , the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict -- conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk .
in my team , the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience .
some of us may have been sublimated , but really none of us remained the same .
i was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos .
and in my mind , i realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence .
it made me wonder if there could be a better way -- a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
and in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells .
in 1988 , at the university of minnesota , i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .
i witnessed the technical difficulty .
and this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells .
i thought to myself , why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells ? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ .
and at that time , stem cell research had gained momentum , following the isolation of the world 's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s .
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology , and this inspired a shift in my mindset , from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells .
and i focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants .
today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells .
embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage , chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types .
but the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells .
now to the ridicule of my colleagues , i inspired my lab to focus on what i thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells , adipose tissue , or fat , yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and i , i think , would be very happy to get rid of anyway .
fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells .
and adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood , in our bone marrow , in our fat , our skin and other organs .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells .
and here is the limitation : adult stem cells are mature cells , and , like mature human beings , these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types , as embryonic stem cells [ can ] .
but in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states , made an astounding discovery .
they discovered that adult cells , taken from you and me , could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells , which they termed ips cells , or induced pluripotent stem cells .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful ips cells .
and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
indeed , there is a lot of hype , but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions .
heart disease , stroke , diabetes , spinal cord injury , muscular dystrophy , retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant , personally , to you ?
in may 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
i was about to start a robotic operation , but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room , i realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing -- yes , i fell .
and i started to see floaters and stars , which i casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure .
what happened to me might have been catastrophic , if not for the fact that i was in reach of good surgical access .
and i had my vision restored , but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position .
this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients , and especially those with retinal diseases .
37 million people worldwide are blind , and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision .
stem cell-derived retinal transplants , now in a research phase , may one day restore vision , or part vision , to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide .
indeed , we live in both challenging as well as exciting times .
as the world population ages , scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells .
it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured , our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .
and these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue .
stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body , or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver .
as we speak , there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
what lies ahead ?
heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
1.1 million americans suffer heart attacks yearly .
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
while still in a research phase , stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology .
stem cells provide hope for new beginnings -- small , incremental steps , cells rather than organs , repair rather than replacement .
stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs .
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
as we speak , the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval .
and in the u.k. , neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial .
the research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers .
each one has his story .
my story has been about my journey from organs to cells -- a journey through controversy , inspired by hope -- hope that , as we age , you and i may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life .
thank you .

jenna mccarthy : what you don 't know about marriage
every year in the united states alone , 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
he buys a ring , she buys a dress .
they go shopping for all sorts of things .
she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
and the big day comes .
and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with , and they 'll vow that nothing , not abject poverty , not life-threatening illness , not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion .
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain , until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .
you know , because they can 't hear the snoring anymore .
and then they 'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others ' faces and do the " macarena , " and we 'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know , statistically , half of them will be divorced within a decade .
of course , the other half won 't , right ?
they 'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll .
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others ' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .
and researchers want to know why .
i mean , look , it doesn 't take a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work .
disrespect , boredom , too much time on facebook , having sex with other people .
but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect , excitement , a broken internet connection , mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket .
so what 's going on when it doesn 't ?
what do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?
what are they doing right ?
what can we learn from them ?
and if you 're still happily sleeping solo , why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life ?
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
they stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism .
and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .
and it turns out , the success stories share a few similarities , actually , beyond they don 't have sex with other people .
for instance , in the happiest marriages , the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband .
obvious , right .
it 's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because , women , we care a great deal about being thin and good looking , whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are .
the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy ; we just have to be thinner than our partners .
so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising , we just need to wait for them to get fat , maybe bake a few pies .
this is good information to have , and it 's not that complicated .
research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives .
for example , the happy wife .
instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run , she might say , " wow , honey , thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner . " these are couples who can find good in any situation .
" yeah , it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire , but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars , and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm . " one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work , the more attractive his wife will find him .
because we needed a study to tell us this .
but here 's what 's going on here .
the more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately , they live happily ever after .
in other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department .
here 's an interesting one .
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce .
this is an actual study , and let me clarify .
the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals .
the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures .
now i don 't know how old all of you are , but when i was a kid , your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film , and , by god , film was expensive .
they didn 't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest , smileyest one for the christmas card .
oh no .
they dressed you up , they lined you up , and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye .
but still , i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and i 'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce .
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
do not win an oscar for best actress .
i 'm serious .
bettie davis , joan crawford , hallie berry , hillary swank , sandra bullock , reese witherspoon , all of them single soon after taking home that statue .
they actually call it the oscar curse .
it is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided .
and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous .
it turns out , merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet .
apparently , the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us , but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will , makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison .
and theoretically , i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash , we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we 've got it pretty good .
drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
yeah .
i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline .
but here 's a scary one : divorce is contagious .
that 's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up , it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent .
now i have to say , i don 't get this one at all .
my husband and i have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony .
and i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could .
so now you may be wondering , why does anyone get married ever ?
well the u.s. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone 's spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail , but hopefully you 'll never need that one .
but beyond the profound federal perks , married people make more money .
we 're healthier , physically and emotionally .
we produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not .
we even live longer , which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place .
now if you 're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return , i can 't tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce , but i can only encourage you to try , because the benefits , as i 've pointed out , are significant .
the bottom line is , whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it , i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting .
so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors .
for instance , in my marriage , i 'd say i 'm doing okay .
one the one hand , i have a husband who 's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome .
so i 'm obviously going to need fatten him up .
and like i said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
so we have to keep an eye on that .
and we do like a cocktail or two .
on the other hand , i have the fake happy picture thing .
and also , my husband does a lot around the house , and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives .
so i 've got all those things going for me .
but just in case , i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
i 'll see you at the bar .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / gero _ miesenboeck.html
in the quest to map the brain , many scientists have attempted the incredibly daunting task of recording the activity of each neuron . gero miesenboeck works backward -- manipulating specific neurons to figure out exactly what they do , through a series of stunning experiments that reengineer the way fruit flies percieve light .
biology , brain , neurology , science
1000
gero miesenboeck reengineers a brain
i have a doppelganger .
dr. gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the " dragonball z : android saga . "
if you look very carefully , you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light .
that 's exactly what i do -- optical mind control .
but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination , my motives are not sinister .
i control the brain in order to understand how it works .
now wait a minute , you may say , how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first ?
isn 't that putting the cart before the horse ?
many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis .
they say , " if we could record the activity of our neurons , we would understand the brain . "
but think for a moment what that means .
even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times , we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns , and that 's so difficult , chances are we 'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .
take a look at what brain activity might look like .
in this simulation , each black dot is one nerve cell .
the dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse .
there 's 10,000 neurons here .
so you 're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach .
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
somewhere , in a pattern like this , is you , your perceptions , your emotions , your memories , your plans for the future .
but we don 't know where , since we don 't know how to read the pattern .
we don 't understand the code used by the brain .
to make progress , we need to break the code .
but how ?
an experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean , it 's essential to be able to play with them , to rearrange them at will .
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won 't do . we need to rearrange the pattern .
in other words , instead of recording the activity of neurons , we need to control it .
it 's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain , just some .
the more targeted our interventions , the better .
and i 'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision .
and since i 'm realistic , rather than grandiose , i don 't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .
but we 'll certainly learn a lot .
now , i 'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is .
the history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious .
it dates back at least 200 years , to galvani 's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond .
galvani showed that a frog 's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current .
this experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
galvani 's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of drawbacks .
sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude .
it 's hard to do in animals that run around , and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously .
so around the turn of the last century , i started to think , " wouldn 't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down ? "
so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain , re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light .
such an approach would literally , in a flash of light , overcome many of the obstacles to discovery .
first , it 's clearly a non-invasive , wireless form of communication .
and second , just as in a radio broadcast , you can communicate with many receivers at once .
you don 't need to know where these receivers are ,
and it doesn 't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car .
it gets even better , for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in dna .
so each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function .
i hope you 'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept .
there 's no high-tech gizmos here , just biology revealed through biology .
now let 's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close .
as we zoom in on one of these purple neurons , we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores .
pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system .
but these pores here are special .
they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes .
whenever a flash of light hits the receptor , the pore opens , an electrical current is switched on , and the neuron fires electrical impulses .
because the light-activated pore is encoded in dna , we can achieve incredible precision .
this is because , although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes , different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells .
you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don 't .
so in this cartoon , the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore .
the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .
in this example , each electrical impulse , each deflection on the trace , is caused by a brief pulse of light .
and the approach , of course , also works in moving , behaving animals .
this is the first ever such experiment , sort of the optical equivalent of galvani 's .
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , susana lima .
susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore .
you 're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly .
they trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air
and fly away whenever you move your hand in position .
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it vibrates them , but it can 't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates .
now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see , susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment .
she cut the heads off of her flies .
these headless bodies can live for about a day , but they don 't do much .
they just stand around and groom excessively .
so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity .
anyway , as you 'll see in a moment , susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what 's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away .
they didn 't get very far , obviously .
since we took these first steps , the field of optogenetics has exploded .
and there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches .
and we 've come a long way since galvani 's and susana 's first successes in making animals twitch or jump .
we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways , as i 'll show you in my last example , which is directed at a familiar question .
life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next .
we cope with this pressure by having brains , and within our brains , decision-making centers that i 've called here the " actor . "
the actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate .
our actions change the environment , or context , and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop .
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly .
the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors , and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them .
here 's some such cctv footage .
whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet , it has to make a decision .
it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor , or whether to cross the midline and try something new .
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor 's policy .
now for an intelligent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .
we can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly 's brain contains not only an actor , but a different group of cells , a " critic , " that provides a running commentary on the actor 's choices .
you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain 's equivalent of the catholic church , if you 're an austrian like me , or the super-ego , if you 're freudian , or your mother , if you 're jewish .
now obviously , the critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent .
so we set out to identify the cells in the fly 's brain that played the role of the critic .
and the logic of our experiment was simple .
we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the critic , we should be able , artificially , to nag the actor into changing its policy .
in other words , the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but , in reality , it had not made .
so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
and whenever they made one of the two choices , chose one odor , in this case the blue one over the orange one , we switched on the lights .
if the critic was among the optically activated cells , the result of this intervention should be a change in policy .
the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor .
here 's what happened in two instances :
we 're comparing two strains of flies , each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains , shown here in green on the left and on the right .
what 's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine .
but the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right .
optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences .
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right , you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet , it marches straight through , as it did before .
its behavior is completely unchanged .
but the behavior of the fly on the left is very different .
whenever it comes up to the midpoint , it pauses , it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment , and then it turns around .
this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that 's in the right half of the chamber .
this means that the critic must have spoken in that animal , and that the critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left , but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right .
through many such experiments , we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just 12 cells .
these 12 cells , as shown here in green , send the output to a brain structure called the " mushroom body , " which is shown here in gray .
we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor .
so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice .
based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies , this makes perfect sense .
in fact , it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly .
in this electronic toy circuit , the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue leds in the center of the board .
these led 's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air .
each odor activates a different combination of sensors , which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body .
so the pilot in the cockpit of the fly , the actor , can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue leds lights up .
what the actor does with this information depends on its policy , which is stored in the strengths of the connection , between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly 's evasive actions .
if the connection is weak , the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course .
if the connection is strong , the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .
now consider a situation in which the motors stay off , the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped .
in a situation like this , we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy .
we have created such a situation , artificially , by turning on the critic with a flash of light .
that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors .
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again , the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .
i don 't know about you , but i find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical , mechanistic understanding of the mind , even if it 's the mind of the fly .
this is one piece of good news .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
come to think of it , knowing when you 're wrong without a teacher , or your mother , telling you , is a very hard problem .
there are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done , but we still haven 't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter .
i think we 'll get there in the not too distant future .
thank you .

robert full : learning from the gecko 's tail
let me share with you today an original discovery .
but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened --
not the way i present it in a scientific meeting , or the way you 'd read it in a scientific paper .
it 's a story about beyond biomimetics , to something i 'm calling biomutualism .
i define that as an association between biology and another discipline ,
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other , but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field .
now , in terms of biomimetics , as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature , nature becomes a much more useful teacher .
engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they 're advantageous ,
but then integrating that with the best human engineering , ultimately to make something actually better than nature .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
these are gecko toes .
and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly .
we discovered it . and what we found was that they have leaf-like structures on their toes , with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug ,
and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible : about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size .
and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .
they don 't stick by velcro or suction or glue . they actually stick by intermolecular forces alone , van der waals forces .
and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self-cleaning , dry adhesive has been made .
from the simplest version in nature , one branch ,
my engineering collaborator , ron fearing , at berkeley , had made the first synthetic version .
and so has my other incredible collaborator , mark cutkosky , at stanford --
he made much larger hairs than the gecko , but used the same general principles .
and here is its first test .
that 's kellar autumn , my former ph.d. student , professor now at lewis and clark , literally giving his first-born child up for this test .
more recently , this happened .
man : this the first time someone has actually climbed with it .
narrator : lynn verinsky , a professional climber , who appeared to be brimming with confidence .
lynn verinsky : honestly , it 's going to be perfectly safe . it will be perfectly safe .
man : how do you know ?
lynn verinsky : because of liability insurance .
narrator : with a mattress below and attached to a safety rope , lynn began her 60-foot ascent .
lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood and science .
man : so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
lynn verinsky : ha ! wow . and what a privilege that has been .
robert full : that 's what she did on rough surfaces .
but she actually used these on smooth surfaces -- two of them -- to climb up , and pull herself up .
and you can try this in the lobby , and look at the gecko-inspired material .
now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can 't get unstuck , with the material .
this is the gecko 's solution . they actually peel their toes away from the surface , at high rates , as they run up the wall .
well i 'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot , stickybot , using a new hierarchical dry adhesive .
here is the actual robot .
and here is what it does .
and if you look , you can see that it uses the toe peeling , just like the gecko does .
if we can show some of the video , you can see it climbing up the wall .
there it is .
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at stickybot .
you see something on it . it 's not just to look like a gecko .
it has a tail . and just when you think you 've figured out nature , this kind of thing happens .
the engineers told us , for the climbing robots , that , if they don 't have a tail , they fall off the wall .
so what they did was they asked us an important question .
they said , " well , it kind of looks like a tail . "
even though we put a passive bar there .
" do animals use their tails when they climb up walls ? "
what they were doing was returning the favor , by giving us a hypothesis to test , in biology , that we wouldn 't have thought of .
so of course , in reality , we were then panicked , being the biologists , and we should know this already .
we said , " well , what do tails do ? "
well we know that tails store fat , for example .
we know that you can grab onto things with them .
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance .
it can also act as a counterbalance .
so watch this kangaroo .
see that tail ? that 's incredible !
marc raibert built a uniroo hopping robot .
and it was unstable without its tail .
now mostly tails limit maneuverability ,
like this human inside this dinosaur suit .
my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation , by increasing the moment of inertia of a student , so they had a tail , and running them through and obstacle course , and found a decrement in performance ,
like you 'd predict .
but of course , this is a passive tail .
and you can also have active tails .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we 've talked about an active tail .
video : myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs were interested in love , not war .
robert full : he talked about the tail being a whip for communication .
it can also be used in defense .
pretty powerful .
so we then went back and looked at the animal .
and we ran it up a surface .
but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there .
and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips . this is slowed down 10 times .
so here is normal speed .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
it has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg ,
and it contributes to stability .
if you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered .
this is incredible .
the engineers had a really good idea .
and then of course we wondered , okay , they have an active tail , but let 's picture them .
they 're climbing up a wall , or a tree .
and they get to the top and let 's say there 's some leaves there .
and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf , and there was some wind , or we shook it ?
and we did that experiment , that you see here .
and this is what we discovered .
now that 's real time . you can 't see anything .
but there it is slowed down .
what we discovered was the world 's fastest air-righting response .
for those of you who remember your physics , that 's a zero-angular-momentum righting response . but it 's like a cat .
you know , cats falling . cats do this . they twist their bodies .
but geckos do it better .
and they do it with their tail .
so they do it with this active tail as they swing around .
and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture .
okay , now we wondered , if we were right , we should be able to test this in a physical model , in a robot .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
and we 're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail , with a robot .
if we could have the lights on it .
okay , there it goes .
and show the video .
there it is .
and it works just like it does in the animal .
so all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself .
now , of course , we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations , so we thought , " oh that 's okay . we 'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel .
we 'll blow the air up , we 'll give it a landing target , a tree trunk , just outside the plexi-glass enclosure , and see what it does .
so we did . and here is what it does .
so the wind is coming from the bottom . this is slowed down 10 times .
it does an equilibrium glide . highly controlled .
this is sort of incredible . but actually it 's quite beautiful , when you take a picture of it .
and it 's better than that , it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air .
and the way it does it , is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left , and it swings its other way to yaw right .
so we can maneuver this way .
and then -- we had to film this several times to believe this -- it also does this . watch this .
it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .
it can actually swim through the air .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ?
maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees , and trying to control a glide . stay tuned for that .
so then we wondered , " can they actually maneuver with this ? "
so there is the landing target . could they steer towards it with these capabilities ? here it is in the wind tunnel .
and it certainly looks like it .
you can see it even better from down on top .
watch the animal .
definitely moving towards the landing target .
watch the whip of its tail as it does it . look at that .
it 's unbelievable .
so now we were really confused ,
because there are no reports of it gliding .
so we went , " oh my god , we have to go to the field , and see if it actually does this . "
completely opposite of the way you 'd see it on a nature film , of course .
we wondered , " do they actually glide in nature ? "
well we went to the forests of singapore and southeast asia .
and the next video you see is the first time we 've showed this .
this is the actual video -- not staged , a real research video -- of animal gliding down . there is a red trajectory line .
look at the end to see the animal .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close-up . and see if you can see it land .
so there it comes down . there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line .
you see it there ? there ? watch it come down .
now watch up there and you can see the landing . did you see it hit ?
it actually uses its tail too ,
just like we saw in the lab .
so now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail .
and here is the first active tail , in the robot , made by boston dynamics .
so to conclude , i think we need to build biomutualisms , like i showed , that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application .
to do this though , we need to redesign education in a major way , to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication ,
and explicitly train people how to contribute to , and benefit from other disciplines .
and of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it .
that is , whether you care about security , search and rescue or health , we must preserve nature 's designs , otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
and from what i heard from our new president , i 'm very optimistic . thank you .

rob dunbar : discovering ancient climates in oceans and ice
if you really want to understand the problem that we 're facing with the oceans , you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics .
we can 't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way .
so i 'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
we 'll look at sea level rise .
we 'll look at ocean warming .
and then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me , you know , " what do you worry about the most ?
what frightens you ? "
for me , it 's ocean acidification .
and this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
so i will spend a little time at the end .
i was in copenhagen in december like a number of you in this room .
and i think we all found it , simultaneously , an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience .
i sat in this large negotiation hall , at one point , for three or four hours , without hearing the word " oceans " one time .
it really wasn 't on the radar screen .
the nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states , the low-lying island states .
and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like kiribati and nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
you know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
one of the problems is coming up with the right target .
it 's not clear what the target should be .
and how can you figure out how to fix something if you don 't have a clear target ?
now , you 've heard about " two degrees " : that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees .
but there 's not a lot of science behind that number .
we 've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
should it be 450 ? should it be 400 ?
there 's not a lot of science behind that one either .
most of the science that is behind these numbers , these potential targets , is based on studies on land .
and i would say , for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be , we would argue that they must be much lower .
you know , from an oceanic perspective , 450 is way too high .
now there 's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350 .
we are , right now , at 390 parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere .
we 're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450 , so we 've got to accept we 're going to do an overshoot , and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what 's the pathway back to 350 .
now , why is this so complicated ?
why don 't we know some of these things a little bit better ?
well , the problem is that we 've got very complicated forces in the climate system .
there 's all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
there 's air-sea interactions .
here in galapagos , we 're affected by el ninos and la nina .
but the entire planet warms up when there 's a big el nino .
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
that changes our climate .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
so anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
and we know the solar output 's not constant through time .
so those are all natural causes of climate change .
and then we have the human-induced causes of climate change as well .
we 're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land , the reflectivity .
we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide -- it 's methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .
so here 's the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
is co2 produced by man 's activities causing the planet to warm up ?
but to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change .
but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things .
you know , thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes .
and we 've got it worked out , and we can say , " yes , co2 is causing the planet to warm up now . "
now , we have many ways to study natural variability .
i 'll show you a few examples of this now .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic .
it 's a scientific drilling vessel .
we go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change , right .
like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co2 double what it is today .
and so that 's what we 've done with this ship .
this was -- this is south of the antarctic circle .
it looks downright tropical there .
one day where we had calm seas and sun , which was the reason i could get off the ship .
most of the time it looked like this .
we had a waves up to 50 ft. and winds averaging about 40 knots for most of the voyage and up to 70 or 80 knots .
so that trip just ended , and i can 't show you too many results from that right now , but we 'll go back one more year , to another drilling expedition i 've been involved in .
this was led by ross powell and tim naish .
it 's the andrill project .
and we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet .
this is a crazy thing , this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm , drilling at temperatures of minus 40 .
and we drilled in the ross sea .
that 's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there .
so , this huge floating ice shelf the size of alaska comes from west antarctica .
now , west antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as 2,000 meters deep .
so that ice sheet is partly floating , and it 's exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
this is the part of antarctica that we worry about .
because it 's partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north .
when that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
so we drill back in time to see how often that 's happened , and exactly how fast that ice can melt .
here 's the cartoon on the left there .
we drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor .
so it 's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
and here 's what we found .
now , there 's 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses .
but it turns out , you know , the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description .
you know , we saw this in the core samples as they came up .
we saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there 's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand .
that 's the kind of material in the deep sea .
it can only get there if it 's carried out by ice .
so we know there 's an ice shelf overhead .
and that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
this is absolutely beautiful stuff .
this sediment is 100 percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants .
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there 's no ice overhead .
and we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water , between gravels and these plant sediments .
so what that means is , what it tells us is that the ross sea region , this ice shelf , melted back and formed anew about 35 times .
and this is in the past four million years .
this was completely unexpected .
nobody imagined that the west antarctic ice sheet was this dynamic .
in fact , the lore for many years has been , " the ice formed many tens of millions of years ago , and it 's been there ever since . "
and now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again , and sea level went up and down , six meters at a time .
what caused it ?
well , we 're pretty sure that it 's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica , just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth .
but here 's the key thing : you know , the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold , that the planet warmed up enough -- and the number 's about one degree to one and a half degrees centigrade -- the planet warmed up enough that it became ...
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
and you know what ?
we 've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
so many of us are convinced now that west antarctica , the west antarctic ice sheet , is starting to melt .
we do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century .
and it could be larger than that .
this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati , you know , where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level .
okay , the second story takes place here in galapagos .
this is a bleached coral , coral that died during the 1982- ' 83 el nino .
this is from champion island .
it 's about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .
and it 's covered with algae . that 's what happens .
when these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
and so , when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event , it leaves this indelible record .
you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .
so one of the things thought of in the ' 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event .
and just so you know , 1982- ' 83 , that el nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in galapagos .
then there was similar mortality in ' 97- ' 98 .
and what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events .
we saw no other mass mortality events .
so these events in our recent past really are unique .
so they 're either just truly monster el ninos , or they 're just very strong el ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming .
either case , it 's bad news for the corals of the galapagos islands .
here 's how we sample the corals .
this is actually easter island . look at this monster .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
now , sylvia earle turned me on to this exact same coral .
and she was diving here with john lauret -- i think it was 1994 -- and collected a little nugget and sent it to me .
and we started working on it , and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this .
so we have a diamond drill .
we 're not killing the colony ; we 're taking a small core sample out of the top .
the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
so we 've done that all over the eastern pacific .
we 're starting to do it in the western pacific as well .
i 'll take you back here to the galapagos islands .
and we 've been working at this fascinating uplift here in urbina bay .
that the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
and so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .
if you go on the ground there , it looks like this , and this is the grandaddy coral .
it 's 11 meters in diameter , and we know that it started growing in the year 1584 .
imagine that .
and that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters , until 1954 , when the earthquake happened .
now the reason we know it 's 1584 is that these corals have growth bands .
when you cut them , slice those cores in half and x-ray them , you see these light and dark bands .
each one of those is a year .
we know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry .
we can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral , and there 's a whole bunch of things we can do .
but in this case , we measured the different isotopes of oxygen .
their ratio tells us the water temperature .
in this example here , we had monitored this reef in galapagos with temperature recorders , so we know the temperature of the water the coral 's growing in .
then after we harvest a coral , we measure this ratio , and now you can see , those curves match perfectly .
in this case , at these islands , you know , corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water .
and of course , our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
so , what we do : we 've merged a lot of different data sets .
it 's not just my group ; there 's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
but we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years , and we put them together .
here 's a synthetic diagram .
there 's a whole family of curves here .
but what 's happening : we 're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet .
and there 's five or six different compilations there , but each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
we do similar things with ice cores .
we work with tree rings .
and that 's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century , right ?
and i chose this one because it 's complicated and messy looking , right .
this is as messy as it gets .
you can see there 's some signals there .
some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
some of them show greater variability .
but they all tell us what the natural variability is .
some of them are from the northern hemisphere ; some are from the entire globe .
but here 's what we can say : what 's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down .
it was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
and there is natural variability caused by the sun , caused by el ninos .
a century-scale , decadal-scale variability , and we know the magnitude ; it 's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree centigrade .
but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black .
and there 's the temperature up there in 2009 .
you know , we 've warmed the globe about a degree centigrade in the last century , and there 's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we 've seen in the last century .
you know , that 's the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that 's truly different .
so i 'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
i like it as a component of global change to talk about , because , even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic , and i talk to that community fairly often , you cannot deny the simple physics of co2 dissolving in the ocean .
you know , we 're pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
right now , about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea , right ?
and as it does so , it makes the ocean more acidic .
so , you cannot argue with that .
that is what 's happening right now , and it 's a very different issue than the global warming issue .
it has many consequences .
there 's consequences for carbonate organisms .
there are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate -- plants and animals both .
the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
that material is more soluble in acidic fluid .
so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells .
at some point , as this transience , as this co2 uptake in the ocean continues , that material 's actually going to start to dissolve .
and on coral reefs , where some of the main framework organisms disappear , we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .
but it 's not just the carbonate producers that are affected .
there 's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean .
so many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean .
so , all of these things -- greater metabolic demands , reduced reproductive success , changes in respiration and metabolism .
you know , these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere , going back millions of years .
we used to do it just with ice cores , but in this case , we 're going back 20 million years .
and we take samples of the sediment , and it tells us the co2 level of the ocean , and therefore the co2 level of the atmosphere .
and here 's the thing : you have to go back about 15 million years to find a time when co2 levels were about what they are today .
you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , with co2 levels lower than they are today .
that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that 's going on right now .
so , charlie veron came up with this statement last year : " the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic co2 release . "
and i think that may very well be true , so i 'll close with this .
you know , we do need the protected areas , absolutely , but for the sake of the oceans , we have to cap or limit co2 emissions as soon as possible .
thank you very much .

jehane noujaim wishes for a global day of film
i can 't help but with this wish to think about when you 're a little kid and you -- all your friends ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world , what would it be ?
and i always answered , " well , i 'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for . "
well , then you 'd be screwed because you 'd know what to wish for and you 'd used up your wish .
and now , since we only have one wish -- unlike last year they had three wishes -- i 'm not going to wish for that .
so let 's get to what i would like , which is world peace .
and i know what you 're thinking .
you 're thinking , the poor girl up there -- she thinks she 's at a beauty pageant . she 's not . she 's at the ted prize .
but i really do think it makes sense , and i think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other .
i 've met a lot of different people over the years and i 've filmed some of them -- from a dotcom executive in new york that wanted to take over the world to a military press officer in qatar that would rather not take over the world .
if you 've seen the film " control room " that was sent out , you 'd understand a little bit why . thank you .
wow ! some of you watched it .
that 's great . that 's great .
so basically what i 'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel , to meet people in a different way than -- because you can 't travel all over the world at the same time .
and a long time ago -- well , about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .
and i 'm going to show you slides of the exchange student .
this is donna .
this is donna at the statue of liberty .
this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike .
this is donna eating ice cream .
and this is donna teaching my aunt how to do a filipino dance .
now i really think as the world is getting smaller , it becomes more and more important that we learn each other 's dance moves , that we meet each other , we get to know each other , we are able to figure out a way to cross borders , to understand each other , to understand people 's hopes and dreams , what makes them laugh and cry .
and i know that we can 't all do exchange programs , and i can 't force everybody to travel .
i 've already talked about that to chris and amy , and they said that there 's a problem with this .
you can 't force people of free will , and i totally support that .
so we 're not forcing people to travel .
but i 'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn 't require a ship or an airplane , and just requires a movie camera , a projector and a screen .
and that 's what i 'm going to talk to you about today .
i was asked that i speak a little bit about where i personally come from , and cameron , i don 't know how you managed to get out of that one , but i think that building bridges is important to me because of where i come from .
i 'm the daughter of an american mother and an egyptian-lebanese-syrian father .
so i 'm the living product of two cultures coming together .
no pun intended .
and i 've also been called -- as an egyptian-lebanese-syrian american with a persian name -- the " middle east peace crisis . "
so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together , a way to take the worlds with me , a way to tell stories visually .
it all kind of started that way , but i think that i really realized the power of the image when i first went to the garbage-collecting village in egypt ,
when i was about 16 . my mother took me there .
she 's somebody that believes strongly in community service and decided that this was something that i needed to do and so i went there and i met some amazing women there .
there was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage .
and i began to start teaching there .
i taught english , and i met some incredible women there .
i met people that live seven people to a room , barely can afford their evening meal , yet live with this strength of spirit and sense of humor
and just incredible qualities .
i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures there .
i took pictures of weddings and older family members , things that they wanted memories of .
about two years after i started taking these pictures , the un conference on population and development asked me to show them at the conference .
so i was 18 ; i was very excited .
it was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there , and after about two days , they all came down except for three .
people were very upset , very angry that i was showing these dirty sides of cairo , and why didn 't i cut the dead donkey out of the frame ?
and as i sat there , i got very depressed . i looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were , you know , very pretty photographs and i was like , i failed at this .
but i was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs .
i mean , here i was , this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to , and all of a sudden i put these photographs on the wall and there were arguments , and they had to be taken down .
and i just saw the power of the image .
and it was incredible .
and i think the most important reaction that i saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves , that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances .
and i think it was at that point that i decided that i wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps , to bridge cultures , bring people together , cross borders .
and so that 's what really kind of started me off .
did a stint at mtv , made a film called " startup.com , " and i 've done a couple of music films --
but in 2003 , when the war in iraq was about to start , it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started , there was kind of this media war that was going on .
and i was watching television in new york and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across , and the coverage went from the u.s. state department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings , and the iraqis would be greeting the americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of baghdad .
and i knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the middle east where my parents were .
i knew that there was a completely other story being told , and i was thinking , how are people supposed to communicate with each other when they 're getting completely different messages and nobody knows what the other 's being told ?
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
or know how to move together into the future ?
so i knew that i had to go there .
i just wanted to be in the center .
i had no plan . i had no funding .
i didn 't even have a camera at the time .
i had somebody bring it there because i wanted to get access to al jazeera , george bush 's favorite channel and a place which i was very curious about because it 's disliked by many governments across the arab world and also called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by some people in the u.s. government .
so i was thinking , you know , this station that 's hated by so many people has to be doing something right .
i 've got to go see what this is all about .
and i also wanted to go see central command , which was 10 minutes away , and that way i could get access to how this news was being created on the arab side reaching the arab world , and on the u.s. and western side reaching the u.s .
and when i went there and sat there , and met these people that were in the center of it and sat with these characters , i met some surprising , very complex people .
and i 'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them , and you listen to them , and you allow them more than a five-second sound bite , the amazing complexity of people emerge .
sameer khader : business as usual .
iraq , and then iraq , and then iraq .
but between us , if i 'm offered a job with fox , i 'll take it .
to change the arab nightmare into the american dream .
i still have that dream . maybe i will never be able to do it .
but i have plans for my children .
when they finish their high school i will send them to america to study there .
i will pay for their study .
and they will stay there .
josh rushing : the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers -- al jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because america doesn 't show those kinds of images .
most of the news in america won 't show really gory images and this showed american soldiers in uniform strewn about a floor , a cold tile floor .
and it was revolting . it was absolutely revolting .
it made me sick to my stomach .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in basra , and al jazeera had shown images of the people .
and they were equally if not more horrifying -- the images were .
and i remember having seen it in the al jazeera office and thought to myself , " wow , that 's gross .
that 's bad . "
and then going away , and probably eating dinner or something .
and it didn 't affect me as much .
so -- the impact it had on me , me realizing that i just saw people on the other side , and those people in the al jazeera office must have felt the way i was feeling that night .
and it upset me on a profound level that i wasn 't bothered as much the night before .
it makes me hate war .
but it doesn 't make me believe that we 're in world that can live without war yet .
jehane noujaim : i was overwhelmed by the response of the film , for we didn 't know whether it would be able to get out there .
we had no funding for it .
we were incredibly lucky that it got picked up , and when we showed the film in both the united states and the arab world we had such incredible reactions . it was amazing to see how people were moved by this film .
in the arab world -- and it 's not really by the film ; it 's by the characters .
i mean , josh rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things .
and when i showed the film in the middle east , people wanted to meet josh .
he kind of redefined us as an american population .
people started to , you know , ask me , where is this guy now ?
al jazeera offered him a job .
and sameer , on the other hand , was also quite an interesting character for the arab world to see , because it brought out the complexities of this love / hate relationship that the arab world has with the west .
in the united states , i was blown away by the motivations , the positive motivations of the american people when they 'd see this film .
you know , we 're criticized abroad for believing we 're the saviors of the world in some way , but the flip side of it is that actually , when people do see what is happening abroad and people 's reactions to some of our policy abroad , we feel this power that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things .
and i saw this with audiences . this woman came up to me after the screening and said , " you know , i know this is crazy . i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes ; i saw the military going out to war .
but you don 't understand people 's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war , and how do we get out of this bubble ?
how do we understand what the other person is thinking ? "
now , i don 't know whether a film can change the world , but i know that it starts -- i know the power of it -- i know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world .
now , i 'm not a philosopher , so i feel like i shouldn 't go into great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world .
because i believe that film has the ability to take you across borders .
i 'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world .
and these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we are faced with today .
man : as long as there is injustice , someone must make a sacrifice !
woman : that 's no sacrifice , that 's revenge !
if you kill , there 's no difference between victim and occupier .
man : if we had airplanes , we wouldn 't need martyrs , that 's the difference .
woman : the difference is that the israeli military is still stronger .
man : then let us be equal in death .
we still have paradise .
woman : there is no paradise ! it only exists in your head !
man : god forbid !
may god forgive you .
if you were not abu azzam 's daughter ... anyway , i 'd rather have paradise in my head than live in this hell !
in this life , we 're dead anyway .
one only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer .
woman : and what about us ? the ones who remain ?
will we win that way ?
don 't you see what you 're doing is destroying us ?
and that you give israel an alibi to carry on ?
man : so with no alibi , israel will stop ?
woman : perhaps . we have to turn it into a moral war .
man : how , if israel has no morals ?
woman : be careful !
zvika : my wife ayelet called me and said , " there was a suicide bombing in tel aviv . "
ayelet : what do you know about the casualties ?
we 're looking for three girls .
zvika : we have no information .
ayelet : one is wounded here , but we haven 't heard from the other three .
zvika : i said , " ok , that 's bat-chen , that 's my daughter .
are you sure she is dead ? "
they said yes .
george : on that day , at around 6 : 30 i was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket .
when we got to here ,
we saw three israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .
when we passed by the first jeep , they opened fire on us .
and my 12-year-old daughter christine was killed in the shooting .
i am the headmaster for all parts .
george : but there is a teacher that is in charge ?
tzvika : yes , i have assistants .
i deal with children all the time .
george : at first , i thought it was a strange idea .
but after thinking logically about it , i didn 't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .
george : there were many things that touched me .
we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot , who lost children , and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .
if we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other , and look forward to a better future , then everyone else must do so , too .
man : song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we 're coming from .
you could give them a long political speech they would still not understand .
but i tell you , when you finish that song , people will be like , " damn , i know where you niggaz are coming from .
i know where you guys are coming from . death unto apartheid ! "
narrator : it 's about the liberation struggle . it 's about those children who took to the streets , fighting , screaming , " free nelson mandela ! "
it 's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom .
yes . yes !
freedom !
jehane noujaim : i think everybody 's had that feeling of sitting in a theater , in a dark room , with other strangers , watching a very powerful film , and they felt that feeling of transformation .
and
what i 'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film ?
i 've been listening to the talks in some of the conference , and robert wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person 's humanity , then they will have an appreciation for ours .
and that 's what this is about .
it 's about connecting people through film , getting these independent voices out there .
now josh rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with al jazeera , so his feeling is that he 's on al jazeera international because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between east and west .
and that 's an amazing thing .
but i 've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices , to give power to the filmmakers , to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .
and there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already .
there 's witness , that you heard from earlier .
there 's just vision , that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace , and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it 's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who 's had her daughter killed in an attack , and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .
there 's working films and there 's current tv , which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes , it 's amazing .
i watched it and i 'm just -- i 'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world , independent voices from around the world , and create a truly democratic , global television .
so what can we do to create a platform for these organizations , to create some momentum , to get everybody in the world involved in this movement ?
i 'd like for us to imagine for a second -- imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world .
you have towns and villages and theaters all from around the world getting together , and sitting in the dark , and sharing a communal experience of watching a film , or a couple of films , together .
watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live , or just a character that defies stereotypes , makes a joke , sings a song .
comedies , documentaries , shorts .
this amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together , to cross borders and have people feel like they 're having a communal experience .
so if you imagine this day when all around the world you have theaters from around the world and places where we project films .
if you imagine from -- projecting from times square to tahir square in cairo , the same film in ramallah , the same film in jerusalem .
you know , we 've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the great pyramid and the great wall of china .
it 's endless what you can imagine , in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience .
and i believe that this one day , if we can create it , this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices .
there isn 't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there , and yet i 'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest danger in our future is [ lack of ] understanding the other and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders .
and if film can do that , and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together , this could be an incredible day .
so we 've already made a partnership actually , set up through somebody from the ted community , john camen , introduced me to steven apkon , from the jacob burns film center .
and we started calling up everybody .
and in the last week , there have been so many people that have responded to us from as close as palo alto to mongolia and to india .
there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film , to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .
now , we 've thought about a name for this day and i 'd like to share this with you .
now , the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes , and so i invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future ?
how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future , so that we can build community and have these communities working together , through the internet ?
there was a time , many , many years ago , when all of the continents were stuck together .
and we called that landmass pangea .
so what we 'd like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day .
and if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching , then i think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better .
i know that it 's very intangible , touching people 's hearts and souls , but the only way that i know how to do it , the only way that i know how to reach out to somebody 's heart and soul all across the world is by showing them a film .
and i know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen .
and that 's my wish .
so i guess i 'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish , but we 're way out of time .
chris anderson : that is an incredible wish .
pangea cinema -- the day the world comes together .
jn : it 's more tangible than world peace , and it 's certainly more immediate .
but it would be the day that the world comes together through film , the power of film .
ca : ladies and gentlemen , jehane noujaim .

brian greene on string theory
in the year 1919 , a virtually unknown german mathematician , named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold and , in some ways , a very bizarre idea . he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of . that is in addition to left , right , back , forth and up , down , kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don 't yet see . now , when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea , sometimes that 's all it is -- bold and bizarre , but it has nothing to do with the world around us . this particular idea , however -- although we don 't yet know whether it 's right or wrong , and at the end i 'll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it 's right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
so , i 'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions . so where do we go ?
to begin we need a little bit of back story . go to 1907 .
this is a year when einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the grand , pervasive force of gravity . and in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved .
newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well , describes the motion of planets , the motion of the moon and so forth , the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees , hitting people on the head . all of that could be described using newton 's work . but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story , because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity , he 'd been unable to figure out how it really works . how is it that the sun , 93 million miles away , [ that ] somehow it affects the motion of the earth ?
how does the sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence ?
and that is a task to which einstein set himself -- to figure out how gravity works .
and let me show you what it is that he found . so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself . the idea goes like this : imagine space is a substrate of all there is . einstein said space is nice and flat , if there 's no matter present .
but if there is matter in the environment , such as the sun , it causes the fabric of space to warp , to curve .
and that communicates the force of gravity .
even the earth warps space around it . now look at the moon . the moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence . we go to a full-frame view of this . the earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that 's curved because of the sun 's presence . that is this new idea about how gravity actually works . now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations . it really works . it describes the data .
and this gained einstein prominence around the world . and that is what got kaluza thinking . he , like einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory . that 's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas , one set of principles , one master equation , if you will .
so kaluza said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
maybe i can play the same game with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the electromagnetic force --
we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about .
you know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth . so kaluza says , maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves . that raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity . there didn 't seem to be anything else to warp or curve . so kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space . he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension . so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension . now here 's the thing : when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions -- those were for gravity -- but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension .
and when he looked at that equation ,
it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force . amazing -- it just popped out .
he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming , " victory ! " --
that he had found the unified theory .
now clearly , kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously . he , in fact --
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming --
-- then dove into the ocean . this is a man who would risk his life on theory . now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation .
number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?
we don 't seem to see them .
and number two : does this theory really work in detail , when you try to apply it to the world around us ?
now , the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named oskar klein .
he suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --
there might be big , easy-to-see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , curled-up dimensions , curled up so small , even though they 're all around us , that we don 't see them .
let me show you that one visually . so , imagine you 're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light .
it 's in manhattan . you 're in central park -- it 's kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint , but you and i all know that it does have some thickness .
it 's very hard to see it , though , from far away .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around --
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction . and i hope you appreciate this . it took so long to get these ants to do this . but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts : big and small . and the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see , but there might be additional dimensions curled up , sort of like the circular part of that cable , so small that they have so far remained invisible .
let me show you what that would look like .
so , if we take a look , say , at space itself --
i can only show , of course , two dimensions on a screen .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that 's not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional curled up dimensions --
here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don 't see them .
but if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around , you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about -- that 's like the grid part -- but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that 's so small that we can 't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment .
but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there .
now that 's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see .
but what about the second question that i asked : does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world ?
well , it turns out that einstein and kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time , and , in detail , it didn 't work .
in detail , for instance , they couldn 't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory .
so many people worked on it , but by the ' 40s , certainly by the ' 50s , this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .
until something wonderful happened in our age .
in our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it 's called superstring theory , as you were indicating .
and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
superstring theory -- what is it ?
well , it 's a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?
the idea is like this .
so , imagine we look at a familiar object , just a candle in a holder , and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of .
so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents .
so deep inside -- we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms .
we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
they have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons .
even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks . that is where conventional ideas stop .
here is the new idea of string theory .
deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
this something else is this dancing filament of energy .
it looks like a vibrating string -- that 's where the idea , string theory comes from . and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns , these can also vibrate in different patterns .
they don 't produce different musical notes .
rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us .
so if these ideas are correct , this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like .
it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
the different frequencies produce the different particles .
the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity .
so matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings .
and that 's what we mean by a unified theory .
now here is the catch .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
it doesn 't work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six .
finally , you can study the equations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time .
it leads us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein -- that our world , when appropriately described , has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
now you might think about that and say , well , ok , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they 're really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won 't see them , if they 're small enough .
but if there 's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won 't see them either . that is true .
one of the other predictions of string theory --
no , that 's not one of the other predictions of string theory . but it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in the remaining time , i 'd like to tell you two features of them .
first is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics , theoretical science .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
these are numbers like the mass of the particles , like electrons and quarks , the strength of gravity , the strength of the electromagnetic force --
a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision , but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do .
now , does string theory offer an answer ?
not yet .
but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
and the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other values than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn 't exist .
this is a deep question .
why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form , when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --
if i had 20 dials up here and i let you come up and fiddle with those numbers , almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear .
so can we explain those 20 numbers ?
and string theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
let me show you how .
so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it 's not one extra dimension , as in the older ideas of kaluza and klein .
this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
they have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape --
name isn 't all that important .
but , as you can see , the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape , interesting structure .
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .
when you swing your hand , you 'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they 're so small that we wouldn 't know it .
so what is the physical implication , though , relevant to those 20 numbers ?
consider this . if you look at the instrument , a french horn , notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument .
now in string theory , all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate .
so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument , strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving .
so let me bring some strings into the story .
and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --
they 'll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions .
so , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don 't yet , but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes , the allowed vibrational patterns .
and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns , we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers .
and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is .
now , the second issue that i want to finish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
and we think -- and this is , i think , very exciting -- that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
here 's how it goes . in cern , geneva , switzerland , a machine is being built called the large hadron collider .
it 's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light .
every so often those particles will be aimed at each other , so there 's a head-on collision .
the hope is that if the collision has enough energy , it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions , forcing it to enter into the other dimensions .
how would we know it ?
well , we 'll measure the amount of energy after the collision , compare it to the amount of energy before , and if there 's less energy after the collision than before , this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away .
and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there .
let me show you that idea visually .
so , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --
that 's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
but here 's how the experiment will go .
you take these particles . you slam them together .
you slam them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions .
so this is the kind of experiment that we 'll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so .
and if this experiment bears fruit , if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there 's less energy in our dimensions than when we began , this will show that the extra dimensions are real .
and to me this is a really remarkable story , and a remarkable opportunity . going back to newton with absolute space --
didn 't provide anything but an arena , a stage in which the events of the universe take place .
einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve -- that 's what gravity is .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism ,
all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see . and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .
amazing possibility .

beau lotto : optical illusions show how we see
i want to start with a game .
and to win this game , all you have to do is see the reality that 's in front of you as it really is . all right ?
so , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
and one of those dots is the same in the two panels . okay ?
and you have to tell me which one .
now , narrow it down to the gray one , the green one and , say , the orange one .
so , by a show of hands -- we 'll start with the easiest one -- show of hands : how many people think it 's the gray one ?
really ? okay .
how many people think it 's the green one ?
and how many people think it 's the orange one ?
pretty even split .
let 's find out what the reality is .
here is the orange one .
here is the green one .
and here is the gray one .
so , for all of you who saw that , you 're a complete realist . all right ?
so , this is pretty amazing , actually , isn 't it ?
because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another .
so , for us , seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does .
and yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
because it 's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do , but who we are as individuals , and who we are as a society .
but first , we have to ask another question , which is , " what is color for ? "
and instead of telling you , i 'll just show you .
what you see here is a jungle scene ,
and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect .
now , can any of you see the predator that 's about to jump out at you ?
and if you haven 't seen it yet , you 're dead . right ?
can anyone see it ? anyone ? no ?
now , let 's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect .
and now you see it .
so , color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces , according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect .
but what you 've just done is , in many respects , mathematically impossible .
why ? because , as berkeley tells us , we have no direct access to our physical world , other than through our senses .
and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world -- not only the color of objects , but also the color of their illumination , and the color of the space between us and those objects .
you vary any one of those parameters , and you 'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye .
this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources .
so let me show you what i mean . imagine that this is the back of your eye .
and these are two projections from the world .
they are identical in every single way .
identical in shape , size , spectral content . they are the same , as far as your eye is concerned .
and yet they come from completely different sources .
the one on the right comes from a yellow surface , in shadow , oriented facing the left , viewed through a pinkish medium .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , viewed through a sort of a bluish medium .
completely different meanings , giving rise to the exact same retinal information .
and yet it 's only the retinal information that we get .
so how on earth do we even see ?
so , if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes , remember this : that the light that falls on to your eye , sensory information , is meaningless ,
because it could mean literally anything .
and what 's true for sensory information is true for information generally .
there is no inherent meaning in information .
it 's what we do with that information that matters .
so , how do we see ? well , we see by learning to see .
so , the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns , finding relationships in information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning , a significance , by interacting with the world .
we 're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes , like language .
so , i 'm going to give you some letter strings . and i want you to read them out for me , if you can .
audience : " can you read this ? "
" you are not reading this . "
" what are you reading ? "
beau lotto : " what are you reading ? " half the letters are missing . right ?
there is no a priori reason why an " h " has to go between that " w " and " a. "
but you put one there . why ?
because in the statistics of your past experience it would have been useful to do so . so you do so again .
and yet you don 't put a letter after that first " t. "
why ? because it wouldn 't have been useful in the past .
so you don 't do it again .
so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality ,
even at the simplest thing the brain does , which is color .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same .
one is simply the flipping of the other . okay ?
now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red . okay ?
and i want you to stare at that dot . don 't look anywhere else .
and we 're going to look at that for about 30 seconds ,
which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk .
but i really want you to learn .
and i 'll tell you -- don 't look anywhere else -- and i 'll tell you what 's happening inside your head .
your brain is learning . and it 's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .
that 's what it 's learning . okay ?
now , when i tell you , i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes .
so why don 't you do that now ?
can i have the lights up again ?
i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore . right ?
why ? because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light , and the left one is still under green light .
that 's your new normal .
so , what does this mean for context ?
it means that i can take these two identical squares , and i can put them in light and dark surrounds .
and now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround .
what 's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter .
it 's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past .
so i 'll show you what i mean . here we have that exact same illusion .
we have two identical tiles , on the left , one in a dark surround , one in a light surround .
and the same thing over on the right .
now , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to review those two scenes .
but i 'm not going to change anything within those boxes , except their meaning .
and see what happens to your perception .
notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite : one very white and one very dark .
all right ? whereas on the right , the two tiles look nearly the same .
and yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround .
why ? because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .
so you see it that way .
whereas on the right , the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light .
if they are under the same light , reflecting the same amount of light to your eye , then they must be equally reflective .
so you see it that way .
which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .
this is one i made a few years ago .
and you 'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top , and a bright orange tile at the side .
that is your perceptual reality . the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same .
here you see four gray tiles on your left , seven gray tiles on the right .
i 'm not going to change those tiles at all ,
but i 'm going to reveal the rest of the scene
and see what happens to your perception .
the four blue tiles on the left are gray .
the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
they are the same . okay ?
don 't believe me ? let 's watch it again .
what 's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion .
so here we have -- let 's turn this around -- a diamond .
and what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to hold it here , and i 'm going to spin it . and for all of you , you 'll see it probably spinning this direction .
now i want you to keep looking at it .
move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
and suddenly it will flip , and start spinning the opposite direction .
yes ? raise your hand if you got that . yes ?
keep blinking . every time you blink it will switch . alright ?
so i can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
how do you know ?
your brain doesn 't know . because both are equally likely .
so depending on where it looks , it flips between the two possibilities .
are we the only ones that see illusions ?
the answer to this question is no .
even the beautiful bumblebee , with its mere one million brain cells , which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina , sees illusions , does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can 't do .
so in my lab , we of course work on bumblebees .
because we can completely control their experience , and see how that alters the architecture of their brain .
and we do this in what we call the bee matrix .
and here you have the hive . you can see the queen bee , that large bee in the middle there . those are all her daughters , the eggs .
and they go back and forth between this hive and the arena , via this tube .
and you 'll see one of the bees come out here .
you see how she has a little number on her ?
yeah there is another one coming out . she has another number on her .
now , they are not born that way . right ?
we pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep .
and then you can superglue little numbers on them .
and now , in this experiment they get rewarded if they go to the blue flowers .
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a proboscis , and they drink sugar water .
now she is drinking a glass of water that 's about that big to you and i , will do that about three times , and then fly .
and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue , but to go to where the other bees go .
so they copy each other . they can count to five . they can recognize faces .
and here she comes down the ladder .
and she 'll come into the hive , find an empty honey pot and throw up , and that 's honey .
now remember -- -- she 's supposed to be going to the blue flowers .
but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner ?
it looks like they 're going to green flowers .
now , are they getting it wrong ?
and the answer to the question is no . those are actually blue flowers .
but those are blue flowers under green light .
so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,
which is exactly what we do .
so , illusions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
okay , this is complete rubbish .
the senses aren 't fragile . and if they were , we wouldn 't be here .
instead , color tells us something completely different , that the brain didn 't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .
we can 't . instead , the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past .
and how we see is by continually redefining normality .
so how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently ?
well , one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .
and they can navigate the world using their ears .
here is david , in the right . and he is holding a camera .
on the left is what his camera sees .
and you 'll see there is a line , a faint line going across that image .
that line is broken up into 32 squares .
in each square we calculate the average color .
and then we just simply translate that into sound .
and now he 's going to turn around , close his eyes , and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed .
he finds it . amazing . right ?
so not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired , but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world .
but we can also do something else . we can also make music with color .
so , working with kids , they created images , thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .
and then we translated these images .
and this is one of those images .
and this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra . and this is what it sounds like .
so , a six-year-old child . okay ?
now , what does all this mean ?
what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature . okay ?
we are not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .
we 're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ecology .
and that ecology is necessarily relative , historical and empirical .
so what i 'd like to finish with is this over here .
because what i 've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty .
because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
so , if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain , i 'd like to do this one .
so , if we have the lights down .
and what we have here -- can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left , and 25 , call it yellowish , surfaces on your right ?
so , now , what i want to do : i 'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .
all right . now you can see that changes the light that 's coming through there . right ?
because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter . i 'm going to do this opposite on the left here .
i 'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light .
now , some of you will notice that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right , or your left , is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right .
agreed ? yes ?
okay . so they are physically the same .
let 's pull the covers off .
now remember , you know the middle nine are exactly the same .
do they look the same ? no .
the question is , " is that an illusion ? "
and i 'll leave you with that .
so , thank you very much .

the feeling of security and the reality of security don 't always match , says computer-security expert bruce schneier . at tedxpsu , he explains why we spend billions addressing news story risks , like the " security theater " now playing at your local airport , while neglecting more probable risks -- and how we can break this pattern .

bruce schneier : the security mirage
so security is two different things : it 's a feeling , and it 's a reality .
and they 're different .
you could feel secure even if you 're not .
and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it .
really , we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word .
and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart -- figuring out when they diverge and how they converge .
and language is actually a problem here . there aren 't a lot of good words for the concepts we 're going to talk about .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it 's a trade-off .
every time you get some security , you 're always trading off something .
whether this is a personal decision -- whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision -- where you 're going to invade some foreign country -- you 're going to trade off something , either money or time , convenience , capabilities , maybe fundamental liberties .
and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer , but whether it 's worth the trade-off .
you 've heard in the past several years , the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power .
that might be true , but it 's not terribly relevant .
the question is , was it worth it ?
and you can make your own decision , and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .
that 's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .
now there 's often no right or wrong here .
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us don 't .
and it 'll depend on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we 're willing to accept the risk of theft .
in politics also , there are different opinions .
a lot of times , these trade-offs are about more than just security , and i think that 's really important .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
we make them every day -- last night in my hotel room , when i decided to double-lock the door , or you in your car when you drove here , when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
we often won 't even notice them .
they 're just part of being alive ; we all do it . every species does it .
imagine a rabbit in a field , eating grass , and the rabbit 's going to see a fox .
that rabbit will make a security trade-off : " should i stay , or should i flee ? "
and if you think about it , the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce , and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve .
so you 'd think that us , as a successful species on the planet -- you , me , everybody -- would be really good at making these trade-offs .
yet it seems , again and again , that we 're hopelessly bad at it .
and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question .
i 'll give you the short answer .
the answer is , we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality .
now most of the time , that works .
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
certainly that 's true for most of human prehistory .
we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in 100,000 b.c. 2010 new york , not so much .
now there are several biases in risk perception .
a lot of good experiments in this .
and you can see certain biases that come up again and again .
so i 'll give you four .
we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks -- so flying versus driving .
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
this is for children .
third , personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks -- so bin laden is scarier because he has a name .
and the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don 't control .
so once you take up skydiving or smoking , you downplay the risks .
if a risk is thrust upon you -- terrorism was a good example -- you 'll overplay it because you don 't feel like it 's in your control .
there are a bunch of other of these biases , these cognitive biases , that affect our risk decisions .
there 's the availability heuristic , which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind .
so you can imagine how that works .
if you hear a lot about tiger attacks , there must be a lot of tigers around .
you don 't hear about lion attacks , there aren 't a lot of lions around .
this works until you invent newspapers . because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks .
i tell people , if it 's in the news , don 't worry about it .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
when something is so common , it 's no longer news -- car crashes , domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .
we 're also a species of storytellers .
we respond to stories more than data .
and there 's some basic innumeracy going on .
i mean , the joke " one , two , three , many " is kind of right .
we 're really good at small numbers .
one mango , two mangoes , three mangoes , 10,000 mangoes , 100,000 mangoes -- it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth -- we 're good at that .
one in a million , one in a billion -- they 're both almost never .
so we have trouble with the risks that aren 't very common .
and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality .
and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack , they get different .
now you either have a feeling -- you feel more secure than you are .
there 's a false sense of security .
or the other way , and that 's a false sense of insecurity .
i write a lot about " security theater , " which are products that make people feel secure , but don 't actually do anything .
there 's no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn 't make us feel secure .
maybe it 's what the cia 's supposed to do for us .
so back to economics .
if economics , if the market , drives security , and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security , then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure .
and there are two ways to do this .
one , you can make people actually secure and hope they notice .
or two , you can make people just feel secure and hope they don 't notice .
so what makes people notice ?
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the threats , the countermeasures , how they work .
but if you know stuff , you 're more likely to have your feelings match reality .
enough real world examples helps .
now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood , because we live there , and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality .
security theater 's exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly .
okay , so what makes people not notice ?
well , a poor understanding .
if you don 't understand the risks , you don 't understand the costs , you 're likely to get the trade-off wrong , and your feeling doesn 't match reality .
not enough examples . there 's an inherent problem with low probability events .
if , for example , terrorism almost never happens , it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .
this is why you keep sacrificing virgins , and why your unicorn defenses are working just great .
there aren 't enough examples of failures .
also , feelings that are clouding the issues -- the cognitive biases i talked about earlier , fears , folk beliefs , basically an inadequate model of reality .
so let me complicate things .
i have feeling and reality .
i want to add a third element . i want to add model .
feeling and model in our head , reality is the outside world .
it doesn 't change ; it 's real .
so feeling is based on our intuition .
model is based on reason .
that 's basically the difference .
in a primitive and simple world , there 's really no reason for a model
because feeling is close to reality .
you don 't need a model .
but in a modern and complex world , you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face .
there 's no feeling about germs .
you need a model to understand them .
so this model is an intelligent representation of reality .
it 's , of course , limited by science , by technology .
we couldn 't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .
it 's limited by our cognitive biases .
but it has the ability to override our feelings .
where do we get these models ? we get them from others .
we get them from religion , from culture , teachers , elders .
a couple years ago , i was in south africa on safari .
the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park .
he had some very complex models of how to survive .
and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant -- and when you had to run away , and when you couldn 't run away , and when you had to climb a tree -- when you could never climb a tree .
i would have died in a day , but he was born there , and he understood how to survive .
i was born in new york city .
i could have taken him to new york , and he would have died in a day .
because we had different models based on our different experiences .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials .
think of models of terrorism , child kidnapping , airline safety , car safety .
models can come from industry .
the two i 'm following are surveillance cameras , id cards , quite a lot of our computer security models come from there .
a lot of models come from science .
health models are a great example .
think of cancer , of bird flu , swine flu , sars .
all of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us , really , by science filtered through the media .
so models can change .
models are not static .
as we become more comfortable in our environments , our model can move closer to our feelings .
so an example might be , if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common , there were a lot of fears about it .
i mean , there were people who were afraid to push doorbells , because there was electricity in there , and that was dangerous .
for us , we 're very facile around electricity .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
our model of security around electricity is something we were born into .
it hasn 't changed as we were growing up .
and we 're good at it .
or think of the risks on the internet across generations -- how your parents approach internet security , versus how you do , versus how our kids will .
models eventually fade into the background .
intuitive is just another word for familiar .
so as your model is close to reality , and it converges with feelings , you often don 't know it 's there .
so a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu .
when swine flu first appeared , the initial news caused a lot of overreaction .
now it had a name , which made it scarier than the regular flu , even though it was more deadly .
and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it .
so there was that feeling of lack of control .
and those two things made the risk more than it was .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
by autumn , people thought the doctors should have solved this already .
and there 's kind of a bifurcation -- people had to choose between fear and acceptance -- actually fear and indifference -- they kind of chose suspicion .
and when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people 's feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wildly with no new information , with no new input .
this kind of thing happens a lot .
i 'm going to give one more complication .
we have feeling , model , reality .
i have a very relativistic view of security .
i think it depends on the observer .
and most security decisions have a variety of people involved .
and stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision .
and i call that their agenda .
and you see agenda -- this is marketing , this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another , trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings , marginalizing people with models you don 't like .
this is not uncommon . an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking .
in the history of the past 50 years , the smoking risk shows how a model changes , and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn 't like .
compare that to the secondhand smoke debate -- probably about 20 years behind .
think about seat belts .
when i was a kid , no one wore a seat belt .
nowadays , no kid will let you drive if you 're not wearing a seat belt .
compare that to the airbag debate -- probably about 30 years behind .
all examples of models changing .
what we learn is that changing models is hard .
models are hard to dislodge .
if they equal your feelings , you don 't even know you have a model .
and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias , where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs .
so evidence against our model , we 're likely to ignore , even if it 's compelling .
it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention .
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .
global warming is a great example .
we 're terrible at models that span 80 years .
we can do to the next harvest .
we can often do until our kids grow up .
but 80 years , we 're just not good at .
so it 's a very hard model to accept .
we can have both models in our head simultaneously , right , that kind of problem where we 're holding both beliefs together , right , the cognitive dissonance .
eventually , the new model will replace the old model .
strong feelings can create a model .
september 11th created a security model in a lot of people 's heads .
also , personal experiences with crime can do it , personal health scare , a health scare in the news .
you 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists .
they can create a model instantaneously , because they 're very emotive .
so in the technological world , we don 't have experience to judge models .
and we rely on others . we rely on proxies .
i mean , this works as long as it 's to correct others .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
i flew here yesterday . i didn 't check the airplane .
i relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly .
we 're here , none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us , not because we checked , but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good .
it 's a model we just accept pretty much by faith .
and that 's okay .
now , what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .
now when these go out of whack , you have two options .
one , you can fix people 's feelings , directly appeal to feelings .
it 's manipulation , but it can work .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
change happens slowly .
the smoking debate took 40 years , and that was an easy one .
some of this stuff is hard .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
and i lied .
remember i said feeling , model , reality ;
i said reality doesn 't change . it actually does .
we live in a technological world ; reality changes all the time .
so we might have -- for the first time in our species -- feeling chases model , model chases reality , reality 's moving -- they might never catch up .
we don 't know .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this .
1982 -- i don 't know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the united states .
it 's a horrific story . someone took a bottle of tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
someone else bought it and died .
this terrified people .
there were a couple of copycat attacks .
there wasn 't any real risk , but people were scared .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
those tamper-proof caps , that came from this .
it 's complete security theater .
as a homework assignment , think of 10 ways to get around it .
i 'll give you one , a syringe .
but it made people feel better .
it made their feeling of security more match the reality .
last story , a few years ago , a friend of mine gave birth .
i visit her in the hospital .
it turns out when a baby 's born now , they put an rfid bracelet on the baby , put a corresponding one on the mother , so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward , an alarm goes off .
i said , " well , that 's kind of neat .
i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals . "
i go home , i look it up .
it basically never happens .
but if you think about it , if you are a hospital , and you need to take a baby away from its mother , out of the room to run some tests , you better have some good security theater , or she 's going to rip your arm off .
so it 's important for us , those of us who design security , who look at security policy , or even look at public policy in ways that affect security .
it 's not just reality ; it 's feeling and reality .
what 's important is that they be about the same . it 's important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security trade-offs .
thank you .

in this brief talk from ted u 2009 , jonathan drori encourages us to save biodiversity -- one seed at a time . reminding us that plants support human life , he shares the vision of the millennium seed bank , which has stored over 3 billion seeds to date from dwindling yet essential plant species .

jonathan drori : why we 're storing billions of seeds
all human life , all life , depends on plants .
let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds .
just think for a moment .
it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small african village , or you live in a big city , everything comes back to plants in the end :
whether it 's for the food , the medicine , the fuel , the construction , the clothing , all the obvious things ; or whether it 's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much ; or whether it 's soil formation , or the effect on the atmosphere , or primary production .
damn it , even the books here are made out of plants .
all these things , they come back to plants .
and without them we wouldn 't be here .
now plants are under threat .
they 're under threat because of changing climate .
and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us .
and people like us want to do things that destroy plants , and their habitats .
and whether that 's because of food production , or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn 't be , or because of habitats being used for other purposes -- all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt , or die , or move .
and plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way .
so if all human life depends on plants , doesn 't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them ?
i think it does .
and i want to tell you about a project to save plants .
and the way that you save plants is by storing seeds .
because seeds , in all their diverse glory , are plants ' futures .
all the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .
so here is the building ;
it looks rather unassuming , really .
but it goes down below ground many stories .
and it 's the largest seed bank in the world .
it exists not only in southern england , but distributed around the world . i 'll come to that .
this is a nuclear-proof facility .
god forbid that it should have to withstand that .
so if you 're going to build a seed bank , you have to decide what you 're going to store in it . right ?
and we decided that what we want to store first of all , are the species that are most under threat .
and those are the dry land species .
so first of all we did deals with 50 different countries .
it means negotiating with heads of state , and with secretaries of state in 50 countries to sign treaties .
we have 120 partner institutions all over the world , in all those countries colored orange .
people come from all over the world to learn ,
and then they go away and plan exactly how they 're going to collect these seeds .
they have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist .
they search for them . they find them in flower .
and they go back when their seeds have arrived .
and they collect the seeds . all over the world .
the seeds -- some of if is very untechnical .
you kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off .
you label them . you do some high-tech things here and there ,
some low-tech things here and there .
and the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully , at low temperature .
and then you have to store them at about minus 20 degrees c -- that 's about minus four fahrenheit , i think -- with a very critically low moisture content .
and these seeds will be able to germinate , we believe , with many of the species , in thousands of years , and certainly in hundreds of years .
it 's no good storing the seeds if you don 't know they 're still viable .
so every 10 years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have .
and this is a distributed network .
so all around the world people are doing the same thing .
and that enables us to develop germination protocols .
that means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate .
and that is very useful information .
and then we grow these things ,
and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from , " look , actually we 're not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants . "
and that 's already happening .
so where have we got to ?
i am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed -- that 's three thousand millionth seed -- is now stored .
ten percent of all plant species on the planet ,
24,000 species are safe ;
30,000 species , if we get the funding , by next year .
twenty-five percent of all the world 's plants , by 2020 .
these are not just crop plants , as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway --
fantastic work there .
this is at least 100 times bigger .
we have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world :
drought-tolerant forest species sent to pakistan and egypt ;
especially photosynthetic-efficient plants come here to the united states ;
salt-tolerant pasture species sent to australia ;
the list goes on and on .
these seeds are used for restoration .
so in habitats that have already been damaged ,
like the tall grass prairie here in the usa , or in mined land in various countries , restoration is already happening because of these species --
and because of this collection .
some of these plants , like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen , they are down to the last few remaining members .
the one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck , that is down to about 30 last remaining trees .
fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine .
we have training going on in china , in the usa , and many other countries .
how much does it cost ?
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
i think that 's cheap , at the price .
and that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it .
the future research is " how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? "
and we 're almost there .
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / joachim _ de _ posada _ says _ don _ t _ eat _ the _ marshmallow _ yet.html
in this short talk from ted u , joachim de posada shares a landmark experiment on delayed gratification -- and how it can predict future success . with priceless video of kids trying their hardest not to eat the marshmallow .

joachim de posada says , don 't eat the marshmallow yet
i 'm here because i have a very important message :
i think we have found
the most important factor for success .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
psychology professor took kids that were four years old
and put them in a room all by themselves .
and he would tell the child , a four-year-old kid ,
" johnny , i am going to leave you here with a marshmallow
for 15 minutes .
if , after i come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . so you will have two . " to tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equivalent to telling us , " we 'll bring you coffee in two hours . " exact equivalent .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
as soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes .
some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
couldn 't do it . could not wait .
what 's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
would look at it .
put it back .
they would walk around . they would play with their skirts and pants .
that child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success ,
which is the ability to delay gratification .
self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later ,
follow-up study .
what did they find ?
they went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19 .
and they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful .
they had good grades . they were doing wonderful .
they were happy . they had their plans .
they had good relationships with the teachers , students .
they were doing fine .
a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
they did not make it to university .
they had bad grades . some of them dropped out .
a few were still there with bad grades .
a few had good grades .
i had a question in my mind : would hispanic kids
react the same way as the american kids ?
so i went to colombia . and i reproduced the experiment .
and it was very funny . i used four , five and six years old kids .
and let me show you what happened .
so what happened in colombia ?
hispanic kids , two out of three ate the marshmallow ;
one out of three did not .
this little girl was interesting ;
she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
in other words , she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it , so she would get two .
but she ate it .
so we know she 'll be successful . but we have to watch her .
she should not go into banking , for example ,
or work at a cash register .
but she will be successful .
and this applies for everything . even in sales .
the sales person that --
the customer says , " i want that . " and the person says , " okay , here you are . "
that person ate the marshmallow .
if the sales person says , " wait a second . let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . " then you sell a lot more .
so this has applications in all walks of life .
i end with -- the koreans did this . you know what ? this is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
we did one for children . and now it is all over korea .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
and we need to learn that principle here in the states ,
because we have a big debt .
we are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
thank you so much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jonas _ gahr _ store _ in _ defense _ of _ dialogue.html
in politics , it seems counterintuitive to engage in dialogue with violent groups , with radicals and terrorists , and with the states that support them . but jonas gahr støre , the foreign minister of norway , makes a compelling case for open discussion , even when values diverge , in an attempt to build greater security for all .

jonas gahr støre : in defense of dialogue
amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today -- we think of financial and economic primarily -- the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue -- our ability to address modern conflicts as they are , to go to the source of what they 're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them .
we who are diplomats , we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states .
and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
there is trade , there is disarmament , there is cross-border relations .
but the picture is changing , and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene .
we loosely call them " groups . "
they may represent social , religious , political , economic , military realities .
and we struggle with how to deal with them .
the rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
you see the green is a traditional interstate conflict , the ones we used to read about .
the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
these are quite different , and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy .
and the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
so in a way , it is everybody 's business .
another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily .
they may have to be dealt with with military means , but they cannot be solved by military means .
they need political solutions .
and we , therefore , have a problem , because they escape traditional diplomacy .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
plus , during the last decade , we 've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous .
after 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us .
it was black or white .
and groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
the west , as i would see it , comes out of that decade weakened , because we didn 't understand the group .
so we 've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others .
now i 'm not naive .
you cannot talk to everybody all the time .
and there are times you should walk .
and sometimes military intervention is necessary .
i happen to believe that libya was necessary and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary .
and my country relies on its security through military alliance , that 's clear .
but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .
let us turn to afghanistan .
10 years after that military intervention , that country is far from secure .
the situation , to be honest , is very serious .
now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem-solver .
when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , i met the commander of isaf , the international troops .
and he told me that , " this can be won militarily , minister .
we just have to persevere . " now four com isaf 's later , we hear a different message : " this cannot be won militarily .
we need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
we can only solve this through a political solution .
and it is not us who will solve it ; afghans have to solve it . " but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 , 2002 .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
everybody seems to agree with that .
it was very controversial to say three , four , five years ago .
now everybody agrees .
but now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know .
because we didn 't talk .
we didn 't grasp what was going on .
the international committee of the red cross , the icrc , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral .
and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk .
my point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk .
and you don 't have to agree when you sit down with the other side .
and you can always walk .
but if you don 't talk , you can 't engage the other side .
and the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree .
prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process , " you don 't make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . " it 's hard , but it is necessary .
let me go one step further .
this is tahrir square . there 's a revolution going on .
the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter .
it will last for a long , long time .
and who knows what it will be called in the end .
that 's not the point .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bottom-up -- people 's revolution . social groups are taking to the streets .
and we find out in the west that we know very little about what 's happening .
because we never talk to the people in these countries .
most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups , because they were terrorists .
so now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution , we find out how little we know .
right now , the discussion goes , " should we talk to the muslim brotherhood ?
should we talk to hamas ?
if we talk to them , we may legitimize them . " i think that is wrong .
if you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing .
and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we don 't accept majority rights ?
because they may turn out to be a majority .
how can we escape [ having ] a double-standard , if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups that are representative ?
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .
but talking can be done in different ways .
we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
there 's a big array of the ways of dealing with this .
so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come , we will further radicalization , i believe .
we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel .
and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side .
the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this .
and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily .
and the reason is what happened in south africa : nelson mandela .
when mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , " it 's time to take up the arms , it 's time to fight , " he would have been followed .
and i think the international community would have said , " fair enough .
it 's their right to fight . " now as you know , mandela didn 't do that .
in his memoirs , " long road to freedom , " he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being , also being a human being . so he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
now south african friends will know that was very painful .
so what can we learn from all of this ?
dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals , not between groups , not between governments -- but it is very necessary .
if we 're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts , if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations . we have to connect with these profound changes .
and what is dialogue really about ?
when i enter into dialogue , i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side 's signals .
we need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward .
we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
and i wouldn 't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
sometimes you have to .
but that strategy seldom takes you very far .
the alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue .
and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy , not only between states , but also within states .
we are seeing some new signs .
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking [ them ] into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
and they brought their knowledge .
and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up . this is perhaps a first element of a change .
in the future , i believe , we should draw examples from these different illustrations , not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society .
and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times , climate change .
how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations , unless we are able to make civil society and people , not part of the problem , but part of the solution ?
it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization .
it 's crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom-up .
we as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
what is it that makes people trust each other , not only between states , but also within states ?
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?
the good thing is that we are not powerless .
we have never had as many means of communication , means of being connected , means of reaching out , means of including .
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it .
now , i hope , in the coming years , that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving , among the afghans , inside the palestinian population , between the peoples of palestine and israel .
and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world , we are not powerless .
we need to improve the necessary skills , and we need the courage to use them .
in my country , i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together , not as a government initiative , but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .
and when tension increased , they already had that dialogue , and that was a strength to deal with different issues .
our modern western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
how are we going to settle and build a bigger " we " to deal with our issues if we don 't improve our skills of communication ?
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
thank you for your attention .

nathan myhrvold on archeology , animal photography , bbq ...
so , i 'm in chile , in the atacama desert , sitting in a hotel lobby , because that 's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection , and i have this picture up on my screen , and a woman comes up behind me .
she says , " oh , that 's beautiful .
what is it ? is that jackson pollock ? " and unfortunately , i can be a little too honest .
i said , " no , it 's -- it 's penguin shit . "
and , you know , " excuse me ! " and i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically .
so , i said , " no , no , really -- it 's penguin shit . "
because i had just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins .
this is a gentoo penguin . and she was still skeptical .
so , literally , a few minutes before that , i downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation ,
which is really quite interesting , because it turns out you can model this as something called " poiseuille flow , " and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum .
actually , technically , it 's not a rectum . it 's called a cloaca .
at this point , she stops me , and she says , " who are you ?
wha -- what do you do ? "
and i was stuck , because i didn 't have any way to describe what i do .
and so , in some sense , this talk today is my answer to that .
it 's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that i do .
and it 's very hard for me to make sense of it , so i 'm not sure that you can .
it 's the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning .
so , some people are afraid of what i do .
some people think i am the nerd tony soprano , and in response , i have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector .
i 'm not sure what these people think , because i don 't speak norsk .
but i 'm not thinking " monsteret " is a good thing .
i don 't know , you know ?
so , one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .
because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations , and see where they succeeded and where they failed .
use science to , you know , work backwards and say , " well , really , what were they thinking ? " and recently , i was in easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you 're struck by these statues , called the moai .
the place is 64 square miles .
they made , so far as we can tell , 900 of them .
why on earth ? and if you haven 't read jared diamond 's book , " collapse , " i totally recommend that you do .
he 's got a great chapter about it .
basically , these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these .
and somewhere along the line , somebody said , " i know ! let 's cut down the last tree and commit suicide , because we need more identical statues . "
and , one thing that isn 't a mystery , actually , was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid , i 'd seen these pictures -- and i thought , " well , why that look on the face ?
why that brow ? " i mean , it 's such a powerful thing .
where did they get that inspiration ?
and then i met yoyo , who is the native rapa nui-an guide , and if you look at yoyo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
there 's many mysteries , these statues .
everyone wants to know , how did they make them , how did they transport them ?
this woman in the foreground is jo anne van tilberg .
she 's the leading archaeologist working easter island today .
and she has studied the statues for 20-some years , and she has detailed records of every single statue .
the one on the page here is the same that 's up there .
one interesting problem is the stone isn 't very hard .
so , this used to be completely smooth . in fact , in many of the statues , when you excavate them , the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth .
but after 1,000 years out in the weather , they look like this .
jo anne and i have just embarked on a project to digitize them all , and we 're going to do a very high-res digitization , first because it 's a way of preserving them .
second , we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically , then , learn a few of the mysteries about them .
how long have they been standing in what positions ?
and maybe , indirectly , get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are .
while i was in easter island , comet mcnaught was there also , so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet .
i also have an archaeological project going on in egypt .
" going on " is perhaps a little bit strong .
we 're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set , to get it going .
so , i 'll talk about it at a future ted .
but there 's some amazing opportunities in egypt as well .
another thing i do is i invent stuff .
in fact , i design nuclear reactors .
not a joke .
this is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle .
the red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors . it 's called the open fuel cycle .
the white lines are what 's called an advance fuel cycle , where you reprocess .
now , this is the normal way it 's done .
it 's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution .
it has a lot of disadvantages : each one of these steps is extremely expensive , it 's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone 's backyard , which is a problem .
so , our reactor eliminates these steps , which , if we can actually make it work , is a really cool thing .
now , it 's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
there 's -- no reactor 's been even built to an old design , much less a new one , in the united states for 25 years .
it 's the kind of very high-risk , but potentially very high-return thing that we do .
changing into a totally different field , we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics , particularly in an area called metamaterials .
a metamaterial is an artificial material , which manipulates , in this case , electromagnetic radiation , in a way that you couldn 't otherwise .
so , this device here is an invisibility cloak .
it may not seem that , but if you were a microwave , this is how you would view it .
rays of light -- in this case , microwave light -- come in , and they just squish around the cell , and they come back the other side .
now , you could do that with mirrors from one angle .
the cool thing is , this does it from all angles .
metamaterials , unfortunately -- a , it only works on microwave , and b , it doesn 't work all that well yet .
but metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field .
it 's -- you know , today i 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business , but , in fact , it 's negative .
but some day , some day , maybe it 's going to work .
we do a lot of work in biomedical fields .
in this case , we 're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .
so , they say the eyes are the windows of the soul -- turns out they 're a window to a whole lot more stuff .
and these happen to be my eyes , by the way .
now , i 'm also very interested in cooking .
while i was at microsoft , i took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in france .
i used to work , also while at microsoft , at a leading restaurant in seattle , so i do a lot of cooking .
i 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue .
but barbecue 's interesting , because it 's one of these cult foods like chili , or bouillabaisse .
various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to --
there 's tremendous traditions , there 's secrecy . and i 'm trying to use a very scientific approach .
so , this is my latest cooker , and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor , that 's because it is .
but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials -- and of course , really the controller over there does it all on software -- you can make some terrific ribs .
this is a high-speed centrifuge .
you should all have one in your kitchen , beside your turbochef .
this subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it clarify chicken stock .
you would not believe it !
i perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food -- in this case , trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are .
it turns out , a , it 's useful , and for a geek like me , it 's fun .
theory is red , black is experiment .
so , i 'm either really good at faking it , or this particular model seems to work .
so , another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , or seti .
and you may be familiar with the movie " contact , " which sort of popularized that .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way .
in fact , almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character , a real person .
so , the jodie foster character here is actually this woman , jill tarter , and jill has dedicated her life to this .
you know , a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism , which is kind of cool , but jill has what i call slow heroism .
she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever .
so , i like to support people that are risking their lives .
after the movie came out , of course , there was a lot of interest in seti .
my kids saw the movie , and afterwards they came to me and they said , " so , dad , so -- so -- that character -- that 's jill , right ? " i said , " oh , yeah , yeah -- absolutely . "
" and that other person , that 's someone -- " i said , " yes . "
they said , " well , you know that creepy rich guy in the movie ?
is that you ? " i said , " well , you know , it 's just a movie ! come on . " so , the seti institute , with a little bit of help from me , and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people , is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek , california , so they can do this seti work .
now , i travel a lot , and i change cell phones a lot , and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is jill , because i really don 't want to miss " the call . "
i mean , can you imagine ? e.t. ' s phoning home , and i 'm not , like , there ? you know , horrible !
so , i do a lot of work on dinosaurs .
i 'm known to tedsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs .
and i resemble that remark .
i 'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs , which is the finding of them .
now , to find dinosaurs , you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur .
it sounds really dumb , but that 's what it is .
it 's horrible conditions , because wherever you have nice weather , plants grow ,
and you don 't get any erosion , and you don 't see any dinosaurs .
so , you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands , areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring .
you know , skiers pray for snow ?
paleontologists pray for erosion .
so , you hike around and -- this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
you hike around , you see something like this .
now , this is something i found , so look at it very closely here .
you 've got this bentonite clay , which is -- sort of swells up and expands .
and there 's some stuff poking out . so , you look at that , and you look up close , and you say , " well , gee , that 's kind of interesting . what are all of these pieces ? " well , if you look closely , you can recognize , actually , from the shape , that these are skull fragments .
and then when you look at this , you say , " that 's a tooth .
it 's a big tooth . " it 's about the size of a banana .
it has a big serration on the edge .
this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground .
and this is what it 's like to find a tyrannosaurus rex , which i was lucky enough to do a few years ago .
now , this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room .
not the same one , actually . this is a cast , which i had bought ,
and then , after buying the cast , i found my own , and i don 't have room for two .
you know .
so , the thing that 's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing , because you 're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago .
it 's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .
the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there 's a problem with asteroid impact , for example .
the study of dinosaurs may , literally , one day save the planet .
study of the ancient climate is very important .
in fact , the mesozoic , when dinosaurs lived , had much higher co2 than today , was much warmer than today , and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of co2 on climate .
but , besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting , it 's also very different than the other things i do , because you get to hike around in the badlands .
this is actually what most dinosaur research looks like .
this is one of my papers : " a pygostyle from a non-avian theropod . "
it 's not as gripping as dinosaur sex , so we 're not going to go into it further .
now , i 'm also really big on photography .
i travel all over the world taking pictures -- some of them good , most of them not .
these days , bits are cheap . unfortunately , that means you 've got to spend more time sorting through them .
here 's a picture i took in the falkland islands of king penguins on a beach .
here 's a picture i took in alaska , a few years ago , of orcas .
i 'd gone up to photograph orcas , and we had looked for a week , and we hadn 't seen a damn orca .
and the last day , the sun comes out , the orcas come , they 're right by the boat . it 's fantastic .
and i get lots of pictures like this .
then , a little bit later , i start getting some pictures like this .
now , to a human audience , i need to explain that if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition , this would be the centerfold .
it 's true .
so , there 's more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shouts , " what 's that in the water ? "
i said , " well , i think that 's what you call a free willy . "
there 's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex .
the first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands .
they don 't have them .
i think paul simon is in the audience , and he has -- he may not realize it , but he wrote a song all about whale sex , " slip-slidin ' away . "
that 's kind of what it 's like .
the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex : they curl their toes too .
so -- where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together ?
you know , there 's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing , passion in life , and focusing all your energy on it , and i 've never been able to do that .
i just -- you know , because , yes , i 'll focus passion on something , but then there will be something else , and then there 's something else again .
and for a long time i fought this , and i thought , " well , gee , i really ought to buckle down . "
and you know , when i was at microsoft , that was so engrossing , and the whole industry was expanding so much , that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .
but ultimately , i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am , but embrace it .
and say , " yeah , you know , i -- this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep , but that 's really what works for me . "
and regardless of whether it 's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex , the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me .
that 's it , thank you .

ben katchor 's comics of bygone new york
i 'm going to read a few strips .
these are , most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called metropolis .
and the first story is called " the faulty switch . "
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
it 's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight .
but at dusk everything changes .
the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower .
and then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them .
we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room .
we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward .
but the sound we are greeted with , as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light , recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop .
this sound colors our first impression of any room ;
it can 't be helped .
but where does this sound , commonly described as a click , come from ?
is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action ?
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?
the often dental consonant of no indo-european language .
or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach ?
in the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls .
but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic .
the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life , announcing our entry into every lightless room .
the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature .
it has a deep melancholy ring .
children don 't like it .
it 's why they leave lights on around the house .
adults find it comforting .
but wouldn 't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship ?
or the recorded crowing of a rooster ?
or the distant peel of thunder ?
thomas edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb .
why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch ?
that 's the end of that .
the next story is called " in praise of the taxpayer . "
that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
these one or two story structures , designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand , were not meant to be permanent buildings .
yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high-rise construction .
although they make no claim to architectural beauty , they are , in their perfect temporariness , a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place .
the most perfect examples occupy corner lots .
they offer a pleasant respite from the high-density development around them .
a break of light and air , an architectural biding of time .
so buried in signage are these structures ,
that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor :
the small commercial building from an earlier century , whose upper floors have been sealed , and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer .
the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive , dark green-gray , striated aluminum siding .
take-out sandwich shops , film processing drop-offs , peep-shows and necktie stores .
now these provisional structures have , in some cases , remained standing the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization ,
a healthy sublimation of the urge to build ,
and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone .
that 's the end .
and the next story is called , " on the human lap . "
for the ancient egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead -- 30 cubits from foot to knee .
it was not until the 14th century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple , upholstered in flesh and cloth .
over the next 200 years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap ,
and then back again .
every child recapitulates this ascension , straddling one or both legs , sitting sideways , or leaning against the body .
from there , to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy , is but a brief moment in history .
you were late for school again this morning . the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap .
the illusion of speech follows incidentally .
what have you got to say for yourself , jimmy ? as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance .
we have fading memories of that provisional temple , erected each time an adult sat down .
on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on .
it is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty .
they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap , as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels .
the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate .
i envision a 36-story , 450-unit residential high-rise -- a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission .
the bathrooms and kitchens will , of course , have no windows .
the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood , which we seek , in vain , as adults , to employ .
that 's the end .
the next story is called " the haverpiece collection " a nondescript warehouse , visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway , serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit .
the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry .
the foreboding sheen of an extra-large date .
do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ?
where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins .
pears dried in the form of genital organs .
apricot halves like the ears of cherubim .
in 1962 the unsold stock was purchased by maurice haverpiece , a wealthy prune juice bottler , and consolidated to form the core collection .
as an art form it lies somewhere between still-life painting and plumbing .
upon his death in 1967 , a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant .
unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century turkish figs for breakfast .
the rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center .
a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar .
that 's the end . thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / danny _ hillis _ two _ frontiers _ of _ cancer _ treatment.html
danny hills makes a case for the next frontier of cancer research : proteomics , the study of proteins in the body . as hillis explains it , genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce . understanding what 's going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens .

danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
i admit that i 'm a little bit nervous here because i 'm going to say some radical things , about how we should think about cancer differently , to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than i do .
but i will also contest that i 'm not as nervous as i should be because i 'm pretty sure i 'm right about this .
and that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .
in order to talk about cancer , i 'm going to actually have to -- let me get the big slide here .
first , i 'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics .
i want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on -- and then talk about something you haven 't heard so much about , which is proteomics . having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer .
so let me start with genomics .
it is the hot topic .
it is the place where we 're learning the most .
this is the great frontier .
but it has its limitations .
and in particular , you 've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body ,
and if that were only true , it would be great , but it 's not .
it 's like the parts list of your body .
it doesn 't say how things are connected , what causes what and so on .
so if i can make an analogy , let 's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder .
so it might be that , if you went to a french restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn 't have butter , you could say , " ah , i see what 's wrong with them . i can make them healthy . "
and there probably are special cases of that .
you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a larder .
so the list of ingredients does tell you something , and sometimes it tells you something that 's wrong .
if they have tons of salt , you might guess they 're using too much salt , or something like that .
but it 's limited , because really to know if it 's a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients .
so if i look at a person and i look at a person 's genome , it 's the same thing .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
and so indeed , there are times when we can find ingredients that [ are ] bad .
cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease .
but most things , you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen , because , mostly , sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome .
so the genome really tells you much more about predisposition .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
but you really for the most part can 't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person -- except in some of these special cases .
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
well first of all , it 's because we can read it , which is fantastic .
it is very useful in certain circumstances .
it 's also the great theoretical triumph of biology . it 's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
it 's fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
and so it 's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct .
so mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing ,
and darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing ,
and then watson and crick actually looked and found one .
so this happens in physics all the time .
you predict a black hole , and you look out the telescope and there it is , just like you said .
but it rarely happens in biology .
so this great triumph -- it 's so good , there 's almost a religious experience in biology .
and darwinian evolution is really the core theory .
so the other reason it 's been very popular is because we can measure it , it 's digital .
and in fact , thanks to kary mullis , you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients .
so for instance , by measuring the genome , we 've learned a lot about how we 're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome , or how we 're related to each other -- the family tree , or the tree of life .
there 's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .
now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do .
and so by reading the genome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know .
and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives , but they may be surprising .
i did the 23andme thing and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
but mostly what you need to know , to find out if you 're sick , is not your predispositions , but it 's actually what 's going on in your body right now .
so to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what 's happening after the genetics ,
and that 's what proteomics is about .
just like genome mixes the study of all the genes , proteomics is the study of all the proteins .
and the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells -- actually , the machines that are operating --
that 's where the action is .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they 're telling each other to grow and to die ,
and when you 're sick , something 's gone wrong with that conversation .
and so the trick is -- unfortunately , we don 't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome .
so the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins , it 's a very elaborate process .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
and it matters how much of the protein it is .
it could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent , so it 's not a nice digital thing like dna .
and basically our problem is somebody 's in the middle of this very long stage , they pause for just a moment , and they leave something in an enzyme for a second , and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don 't work .
and so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way .
people have tried very hard to do this .
i tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it .
i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus .
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems , and i didn 't think this was a very likely one to call back , so i kept on giving him to the delay list .
and then one day , i get a call from john doerr , bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call .
so i was like , " okay . this guy 's at least resourceful . "
so we started talking , and he said , " i really need a better way to measure proteins . "
i 'm like , " looked at that . been there .
not going to be easy . "
he 's like , " no , no . i really need it .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don 't know what 's going on inside of them .
we have to have a window into this . "
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
and i realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it ,
and so i said , " well , let 's look at it . "
applied minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody 's funding or permission or anything .
so we started playing around with this .
and as we did it , we realized this was the basic problem -- that taking the sip of coffee -- that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics .
and so we did that ,
and working with david , we made a little company called applied proteomics eventually , which makes this robotic assembly line , which , in a very consistent way , measures the protein .
and i 'll show you what that protein measurement looks like .
basically , what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient , and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh , how slippery they are , and we arrange them in an image .
and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood .
and we can take a different one tomorrow , and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different -- they 'll be different after you eat or after you sleep .
they really tell us what 's going on there .
and so this picture , which looks like a big smudge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track .
so if i zoom into that picture , i can just show you what it means .
we sort out the proteins -- from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we 're getting ,
and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .
so we 're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it .
and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein .
and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump , bump , bump , bump , bump .
and that 's because we 're measuring the weight so precisely that -- carbon comes in different isotopes , so if it has an extra neutron on it , we actually measure it as a different chemical .
so we 're actually measuring each isotope as a different one .
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
so seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time , and suddenly you say , " wow , it 's way more complicated than we thought it was . "
but we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it .
so this is the signature out of which we 're trying to get patterns .
so what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that responded to a drug and one that didn 't respond to a drug ,
and ask , " what 's going on differently inside of them ? "
and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences .
so here we have alice in green and bob in red .
we overlay them . this is actual data .
and you can see , mostly it overlaps and it 's yellow , but there 's some things that just alice has and some things that just bob has .
and if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug , we see that in the blood , they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug .
we might not even know what this protein is , but we can see it 's a marker for the response to the disease .
so this already , i think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine .
but i think this is actually just the beginning of how we 're going to treat cancer .
so let me move to cancer .
the thing about cancer -- when i got into this , i really knew nothing about it , but working with david agus , i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .
and as i looked at it , to me it didn 't make sense how we were approaching cancer ,
and in order to make sense of it , i had to learn where did this come from .
we 're treating cancer almost like it 's an infectious disease .
we 're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill .
so this is the great paradigm .
this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease .
so what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose -- that is , put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis --
and that works great for infectious diseases .
so if we put you in the category of you 've got syphilis , we can give you penicillin .
we know that that works .
if you 've got malaria , we give you quinine or some derivative of it .
and so that 's the basic thing doctors are trained to do ,
and it 's miraculous in the case of infectious disease -- how well it works .
and many people in this audience probably wouldn 't be alive if doctors didn 't do this .
but now let 's apply that to systems diseases like cancer .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn 't something else that 's inside of you .
it 's you ; you 're broken .
that conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way .
so how do we diagnose that conversation ?
well , right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know , where did it appear ? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body .
and then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer , and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong .
and of course , it really doesn 't have that much to do with what went wrong
because cancer is a failure of the system .
and in fact , i think we 're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing .
i think this is the big mistake .
i think cancer should not be a noun .
we should talk about cancering as something we do , not something we have .
and so those tumors , those are symptoms of cancer .
and so your body is probably cancering all the time ,
but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control .
and so to give you an idea of an analogy of what i mean by thinking of cancering as a verb ,
imagine we didn 't know anything about plumbing , and the way that we talked about it , we 'd come home and we 'd find a leak in our kitchen and we 'd say , " oh , my house has water . "
we might divide it -- the plumber would say , " well , where 's the water ? "
" well , it 's in the kitchen . " " oh , you must have kitchen water . "
that 's kind of the level at which it is .
" kitchen water ,
well , first of all , we 'll go in there and we 'll mop out a lot of it .
and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen , that helps .
whereas living room water , it 's better to do tar on the roof . "
and it sounds silly ,
but that 's basically what we do .
and i 'm not saying you shouldn 't mop up your water if you have cancer ,
but i 'm saying that 's not really the problem ; that 's the symptom of the problem .
what we really need to get at is the process that 's going on , and that 's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions , happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does ?
because normally , your body is dealing with this problem all the time .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,
but it 's fixing them . it 's draining them out and so on .
so what we need is to have a causative model of what 's actually going on ,
and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that .
david got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute and anna barker was there .
and so i gave this talk and said , " why don 't you guys do this ? "
and anna said , " because nobody within cancer would look at it this way .
but what we 're going to do , is we 're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research . "
so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium at usc where we 've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world , from cold spring harbor , stanford , austin -- i won 't even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we 're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this .
we 're doing it in mice first ,
and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this , but they will die for a good cause .
and we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand , when cancer happens , what 's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer .
so let me just end with giving you a little picture of what i think cancer treatment will be like in the future .
so i think eventually , once we have one of these models for people , which we 'll get eventually -- i mean , our group won 't get all the way there -- but eventually we 'll have a very good computer model -- sort of like a global climate model for weather .
it has lots of different information about what 's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales .
and so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer -- and this also will be for als , or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases , things like that -- we will simulate specifically you , not just a generic person , but what 's actually going on inside you .
and in that simulation , what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments , and it might be very gentle treatments , very small amounts of drugs . it might be things like , don 't eat that day , or give them a little chemotherapy , maybe a little radiation .
of course , we 'll do surgery sometimes and so on .
but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .
because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong .
we put it in the equivalent of splints .
and so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer ,
and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job .
and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
it 's going to require a lot of work , a lot of research .
there will be many teams like our team that work on this .
but i think eventually , we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer .
so thank you very much .

david logan on tribal leadership
what we 're really here to talk about is the " how . "
okay , so how exactly do we create this world-shattering , if you will , innovation ?
now , i want to tell you a quick story .
we 'll go back a little more than a year .
in fact , the date -- i 'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date ?
it was february 3rd , 2008 .
anyone remember what happened , february 3rd , 2008 ?
super bowl . i heard it over here . it was the date of the super bowl .
and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues , john king and halee fischer-wright , and i noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties , is that it seemed to us that across the united states , if you will , tribal councils had convened .
and they had discussed things of great national importance . like , " do we like the budweiser commercial ? "
and , " do we like the nachos ? " and , " who is going to win ? "
but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support .
and if you go back in time to february 3rd , it looked like hilary clinton was going to get the democratic nomination .
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .
but when we talked to people , it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states .
now what is a tribe ? a tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people .
and it 's within these tribes that all of our work gets done .
but not just work . it 's within these tribes that societies get built , that important things happen .
and so as we surveyed the , if you will , representatives from various tribal councils that met , also known as super bowl parties , we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day .
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
we said , " the tribes that we 're in are saying it 's going to be obama . "
now , the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes , studying these naturally occurring groups .
all of you are members of tribes .
in walking around at the break , many of you had met members of your tribe . and you were talking to them .
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions .
that is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
so here is the bottom line .
if you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a usc game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people , you would in fact see not a single crowd , just like there is not a single crowd here , but you would see these tribes that are then coming together . and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group .
and so people form tribes .
they always have . they always will .
just as fish swim and birds fly , people form tribes . it 's just what we do .
but here 's the rub .
not all tribes are the same ,
and what makes the difference is the culture .
now here is the net out of this .
you 're all a member of tribes .
if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward , along these tribal stages to what we call stage five , which is the top of the mountain .
but we 're going to start with what we call stage one .
now , this is the lowest of the stages .
you don 't want this . okay ?
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen .
but it 's one that i think we need to learn from .
stage one produces people who do horrible things .
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .
stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .
now , again , we don 't often deal with stage one .
and i want to make the point that as members of society , we need to .
it 's not enough to simply write people off .
but let 's move on to stage two .
now , stage one , you 'll notice , says , in effect , " life sucks . "
so , this other book that steve mentioned , that just came out , called " the three laws of performance , " my colleague , steve zaffron and i , argue that as people see the world , so they behave .
well , if people see the world in such a way that life sucks , then their behavior will follow automatically from that .
it will be despairing hostility .
they 'll do whatever it takes to survive , even if that means undermining other people .
now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver 's license expires .
and the reason that that 's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe ,
which looks like this .
now , am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land , you find a stage two culture ?
no . but in the one near me , where i have to go in just a few days , what i will say when i 'm standing in line is , " how can people be so dumb , and yet live ? "
now , am i saying that there are dumb people working here ?
actually , no , i 'm not .
but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb .
so in a stage two culture -- and we find these in all sorts of different places -- you find them , in fact , in the best organizations in the world .
you find them in all places in society .
i 've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class .
but here is the point . if you believe and you say to people in your tribe , in effect , " my life sucks .
i mean , if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn 't suck . but i don 't . so it does . "
if that 's how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
what kind of innovation would get done ?
the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
in fact it would be basically nil .
now when we go on to stage three : this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
and we park . and we stay .
stage three says , " i 'm great . and you 're not . "
i 'm great and you 're not .
now imagine having a whole room of people saying , in effect , " i 'm great and you 're not . "
or , " i 'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that . "
a whole group of people communicating that way , talking that way .
i know this sounds like a joke . three doctors walk into a bar .
but , in this case , three doctors walk into an elevator .
i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book .
and one doctor said to the others , " did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine ? "
and the other said , " no . that 's great . congratulations ! "
the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said , " well while you were , you know , doing your research , " -- notice the condescending tone -- " while you were off doing your research , i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution . " and the third one got the same wry smile and said , " well , while you were off doing your research , and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery , that eventually we 'll train monkeys to do , or cells or robots , or maybe not even need to do it at all , i was off running the future of the residency program , which is really the future of medicine . "
and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back .
and the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
that is a meeting of a stage three tribe .
now , we find these in places where really smart , successful people show up .
like , oh , i don 't know , tedx usc .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
it is moving from stage three to stage four .
let 's take a look at a quick video snippet .
this is from a company called zappos , located outside las vegas .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , " what do you think they value ? "
it was not christmas time . there was a christmas tree .
this is their lobby .
employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon .
okay , we 're going through the hallway here at zappos .
this is a call center . notice how it 's decorated .
notice people are applauding for us .
they don 't know who we are and they don 't care . and if they did they probably wouldn 't applaud .
but you 'll notice the level of excitement .
notice , again , how they decorate their office .
now , what 's important to people at zappos , these may not be the things that are important to you .
but they value things like fun . and they value creativity .
one of their stated values is , " be a little bit weird . "
and you 'll notice they are a little bit weird .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens . the group gels . and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger , into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence .
stage four tribes can do remarkable things .
but you 'll notice we 're not at the top of the mountain yet .
there is , in fact , another stage .
now , some of you may not recognize the scene that 's up here .
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five , which is " life is great , " this may seem a little incongruous .
this is a scene or snippet from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize .
now think about that . south africa , terrible atrocities had happened in the society .
and people came together focused only on those two values : truth and reconciliation .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
and in this atmosphere , where the only guidance was people 's values and their noble cause , what this group accomplished was historic .
and people , at the time , feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone ,
descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end .
in fact , south africa has not gone down that road . largely because people like desmond tutu set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country , to bring everyone together .
so , people hear this and they conclude the following , as did we in doing the study . okay , got it . i don 't want to talk stage one .
that 's like , you know , " life sucks . " who wants to talk that way ?
i don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives .
i really don 't want to just say " i 'm great , "
because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then i won 't have any friends .
saying , " we 're great " -- that sounds pretty good .
but i should really talk stage five , right ? " life is great . "
well , in fact , there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this .
the first one , if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it , the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights .
i mean , that 's stage five , right ? life is great , oriented only by our values , no other guidance .
in fact , most of the document is written at stage two .
" my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
we 're great ! who is not great ? england ! "
sorry .
well , what about other great leaders ? what about gandhi ?
what about martin luther king ?
i mean , surely these were just people who preached , " life is great , " right ?
just one little bit of happiness and joy after another .
in fact , martin luther king 's most famous line was at stage three .
he didn 't say " we have a dream . " he said , " i have a dream . "
why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
two percent are at stage one .
about 25 percent are at stage two , saying , in effect , " my life sucks . "
48 percent of working tribes say , these are employed tribes , say , " i 'm great and you 're not . "
and we have to duke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
only about 22 percent of tribes are at stage four , oriented by our values , saying " we 're great .
and our values are beginning to unite us . "
only two percent , only two percent of tribes get to stage five .
and those are the ones that change the world .
so the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society .
but you don 't leave them where you found them . okay ?
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
so we have to have the ability to talk all the levels , to go to where they are .
and then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level .
i 'd like to show you some examples of this .
one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan , former mayor of san francisco . before that he was chief of police in san francisco .
and he grew up essentially in stage one .
and you know what changed his life ? it was walking into one of these , a boys and girls club .
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco .
he went from being alive and passionate at stage one -- remember , " life sucks , despairing hostility , i will do whatever it takes to survive " -- to walking into a boys and girls club , folding his arms , sitting down in a chair , and saying , " wow . my life really sucks .
i don 't know anybody .
i mean , if i was into boxing , like they were , then my life wouldn 't suck . but i don 't . so it does .
so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . "
in fact , that 's progress .
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then , over time , getting them connected .
so , what about moving from stage three to stage four ?
i want to argue that we 're doing that right here .
ted represents a set of values ,
and as we unite around these values , something really interesting begins to emerge .
if you want this experience to live on as something historic , then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking .
which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach , extend your influence , but instead , find someone you don 't know , and find someone else you don 't know , and introduce them .
that 's called a triadic relationship .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
they extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them , not just to myself , so that my following is greater , but i connect people who don 't know each other to something greater than themselves .
and ultimately that adds to their values .
but we 're not done yet . because then how do we go from stage four , which is great , to stage five ?
the story that i like to end with is this . it comes out of a place called the gallup organization .
you know they do polls , right ?
so it 's stage four . we 're great . who is not great ?
pretty much everybody else who does polls .
if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll , people will pay attention to the gallup poll . okay , we understand that .
so , they were bored .
they wanted to change the world . so here is the question someone asked . " how could we , instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks , or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that , what does the entire world think ? "
and they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out , " how do we survey the population of sub-saharan africa ?
how do we survey populations that don 't have access to technology , and speak languages we don 't speak , and we don 't know anyone who speaks those languages . because in order to achieve on this great mission , we have to be able to do it .
incidentally , they did pull it off .
and they released the first-ever world poll .
so i 'd like to leave you with these thoughts .
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
you 're in tribes here . hopefully you 're extending the reach of the tribes that you have .
but the question on the table is this : what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making ?
you 're hearing one presentation after another , often representing a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
if you do what we 've talked about , you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you 're in .
and you don 't leave them where they are . you nudge them forward .
you remember to talk all five culture stages .
because we 've got people in all five , around us .
and the question that i 'd like to leave you with is this : will your tribes change the world ?
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / krista _ tippett _ reconnecting _ with _ compassion.html
the term " compassion " -- typically reserved for the saintly or the sappy -- has fallen out of touch with reality . at a special tedprize @ un , journalist krista tippett deconstructs the meaning of compassion through several moving stories , and proposes a new , more attainable definition for the word .
charter for compassion , compassion , faith , religion , science
1074
krista tippett : reconnecting with compassion
we 're here to celebrate compassion .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
as essential as it is across our traditions , as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives , the word " compassion " is hollowed out in our culture , and it is suspect in my field of journalism .
it 's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing ,
or it 's seen as potentially depressing .
karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and , after the fact , the word " compassion " was translated as " pity . "
now compassion , when it enters the news , too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time .
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .
and so what i 'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection .
and i hope you 'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter , that they shape the way we understand ourselves , the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others .
when this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s , we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that .
now the word " tolerance , " if you look at it in the dictionary , connotes " allowing , " " indulging " and " enduring . "
in the medical context that it comes from , it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment .
tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it 's more of a cerebral ascent .
and it 's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .
and the going is pretty rough right now .
i think that without perhaps being able to name it , we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue .
compassion is a worthy successor .
it is organic , across our religious , spiritual and ethical traditions , and yet it transcends them .
compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others , both in our private and in our civic spaces .
so what is it , three-dimensionally ?
what are its kindred and component parts ?
what 's in its universe of attendant virtues ?
to start simply , i want to say that compassion is kind .
now " kindness " might sound like a very mild word , and it 's prone to its own abundant cliche .
but kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .
and it is a most edifying form of instant gratification .
compassion is also curious .
compassion cultivates and practices curiosity .
i love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in los angeles , aziza hasan and malka fenyvesi .
they are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young jews and muslims ,
and as they do that , they cultivate what they call " curiosity without assumptions . "
well that 's going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
compassion can be synonymous with empathy .
it can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation , but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence .
it 's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there , just showing up .
i think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that i mean a willingness to see beauty in the other , not just what it is about them that might need helping .
i love it that my muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vibrant religious other .
i 'm not sure if i can show you what tolerance looks like , but i can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible .
when we see it , we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable , what is possible .
it is so important when we 're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life .
and compassion does seek physicality .
i first started to learn this most vividly from matthew sanford .
and i don 't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him , but he 's paraplegic .
he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
matthew 's legs don 't work , and he 'll never walk again , and -- and he does experience this as an " and " rather than a " but " -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .
and as a teacher of yoga , he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability , health , illness and aging .
he says that he 's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we 're all on .
he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan .
and matthew has made this remarkable observation that i 'm just going to offer you and let it sit .
i can 't quite explain it , and he can 't either .
but he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body , in all its frailty and its grace , without , at the same time , becoming more compassionate towards all of life .
compassion also looks like this .
this is jean vanier .
jean vanier helped found the l 'arche communities , which you can now find all over the world , communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities -- mostly down syndrome .
the communities that jean vanier founded , like jean vanier himself , exude tenderness .
" tender " is another word i would love to spend some time resurrecting .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
and compassion can also have those qualities .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
jean vanier says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , beloved , late friend mother teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it 's in the first instance about changing ourselves .
he 's says that what they do with l 'arche is not a solution , but a sign .
compassion is rarely a solution , but it is always a sign of a deeper reality , of deeper human possibilities .
and compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories , never by statistics and strategies .
we need those things too , but we 're also bumping up against their limits .
and at the same time that we are doing that , i think we are rediscovering the power of story -- that as human beings , we need stories to survive , to flourish , to change .
our traditions have always known this , and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us .
there is , of course , a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam .
and i 'll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
it lodged as shards inside every aspect of the creation .
and that the highest human calling is to look for this light , to point at it when we see it , to gather it up , and in so doing , to repair the world .
now this might sound like a fanciful tale .
some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way .
rachel naomi remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time , because this story insists that each and every one of us , frail and flawed as we may be , inadequate as we may feel , has exactly what 's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us .
rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors .
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing , how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work fred luskin is doing -- i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century -- that science , in fact , is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .
this is going to change science , i believe , and it will change religion .
but here 's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
we all know about the albert einstein who came up with e = mc2 .
we don 't hear so much about the einstein who invited the african american opera singer , marian anderson , to stay in his home when she came to sing in princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn 't have her .
we don 't hear about the einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in europe or the scottsboro boys in the american south .
einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .
but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
he once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old .
and einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced , we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more , not less .
he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi -- he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
and einstein said -- and i think this is a quote , again , that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that " these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living , more necessary to the dignity , security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge . "
now invoking einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us , but actually it is .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word " compassion " in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy .
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it 's not .
this is the full photograph , and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket , smoking a cigar .
and by the look of that paunch , he hasn 't been doing enough yoga .
we put these two photographs side-by-side on our website , and someone said , " when i look at the first photo , i ask myself , what was he thinking ?
and when i look at the second , i ask , what kind of person was he ? what kind of man is this ? "
well , he was complicated .
he was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others .
and it is much harder , often , to be compassionate towards those closest to us , which is another quality in the universe of compassion , on its dark side , that also deserves our serious attention and illumination .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
so was martin luther king , jr . so was dorothy day .
so was mother teresa .
so are we all .
and i want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what fred luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human .
our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems .
but what a liberating thing to realize that our problems , in fact , are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion , towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others .
rachel naomi remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with crohn 's disease .
einstein became a humanitarian , not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter , but because he was a jew as germany grew fascist .
and karen armstrong , i think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that , with a zigzag , have led to the charter for compassion .
compassion can 't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity .
so i want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is einstein with paul robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology .
now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this , and we need them to mine it for us now .
but compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious .
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
thank you .

susan cain : the power of introverts
when i was nine years old i went off to summer camp for the first time .
and my mother packed me a suitcase full of books , which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do .
because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
and this might sound antisocial to you , but for us it was really just a different way of being social .
you have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you , but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind .
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns .
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
and it went like this : " r-o-w-d-i-e , that 's the way we spell rowdie . rowdie , rowdie , let 's get rowdie . " yeah .
so i couldn 't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy , or why we had to spell this word incorrectly .
but i recited a cheer . i recited a cheer along with everybody else .
i did my best .
and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books .
but the first time that i took my book out of my suitcase , the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me , " why are you being so mellow ? " --
mellow , of course , being the exact opposite of r-o-w-d-i-e .
and then the second time i tried it , the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing .
and so i put my books away , back in their suitcase , and i put them under my bed , and there they stayed for the rest of the summer .
and i felt kind of guilty about this .
i felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and i was forsaking them .
but i did forsake them and i didn 't open that suitcase again until i was back home with my family at the end of the summer .
now , i tell you this story about summer camp .
i could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
but for years i denied this intuition , and so i became a wall street lawyer , of all things , instead of the writer that i had always longed to be -- partly because i needed to prove to myself that i could be bold and assertive too .
and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .
and i made these self-negating choices so reflexively , that i wasn 't even aware that i was making them .
now this is what many introverts do , and it 's our loss for sure , but it is also our colleagues ' loss and our communities ' loss .
and at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world 's loss .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
a third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half .
so that 's one out of every two or three people you know .
so even if you 're an extrovert yourself , i 'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .
we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we 're doing .
now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is .
it 's different from being shy .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .
introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation , whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they 're in quieter , more low-key environments .
not all the time -- these things aren 't absolute -- but a lot of the time .
so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .
but now here 's where the bias comes in .
our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts ' need for lots of stimulation .
and also we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink , which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .
so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays : when i was going to school , we sat in rows .
we sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
but nowadays , your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members .
and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone , those kids are seen as outliers often or , worse , as problem cases .
and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert , even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable , according to research .
okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
and when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays .
and interesting research by adam grant at the wharton school has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do , because when they are managing proactive employees , they 're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas , whereas an extrovert can , quite unwittingly , get so excited about things that they 're putting their own stamp on things , and other people 's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface .
now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
i 'll give you some examples .
eleanor roosevelt , rosa parks , gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
now i think at this point it 's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts .
i always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
and we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
even carl jung , the psychologist who first popularized these terms , said that there 's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert .
he said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum , if he existed at all .
and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert / extrovert spectrum , and we call these people ambiverts .
and i often think that they have the best of all worlds .
but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other .
and what i 'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance .
we need more of a yin and yang between these two types .
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them .
and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity .
so darwin , he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations .
theodor geisel , better known as dr. seuss , he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in la jolla , california .
and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly santa claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona .
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time .
and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up .
now of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point , is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
and in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude .
it 's only recently that we 've strangely begun to forget it .
if you look at most of the world 's major religions , you will find seekers -- moses , jesus , buddha , muhammad --
seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
so no wilderness , no revelations .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
it turns out that we can 't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions .
even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you 're attracted to , you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that 's what you 're doing .
and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room , even though there 's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- i mean zero .
so ...
you might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
and do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces ?
and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time ?
one answer lies deep in our cultural history .
western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and " man " of contemplation .
but in america 's early days , we lived in what historians call a culture of character , where we still , at that point , valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude .
and if you look at the self-help books from this era , they all had titles with things like " character , the grandest thing in the world . "
and they featured role models like abraham lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
ralph waldo emerson called him " a man who does not offend by superiority . "
but then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
what happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business .
and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities .
and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their lives , now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers .
so , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
and sure enough , the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like " how to win friends and influence people . "
and they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
so that 's the world we 're living in today .
that 's our cultural inheritance .
now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and i 'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all .
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .
and the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together .
but i am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves , the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems .
so now i 'd like to share with you what 's in my suitcase today .
guess what ?
books .
i have a suitcase full of books .
here 's margaret atwood , " cat 's eye . "
here 's a novel by milan kundera .
and here 's " the guide for the perplexed " by maimonides .
but these are not exactly my books .
i brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather 's favorite authors .
my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up , partly because it was filled with his very gentle , very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books .
i mean literally every table , every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books .
just like the rest of my family , my grandfather 's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
but he also loved his congregation , and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi .
he would takes the fruits of each week 's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought .
and people would come from all over to hear him speak .
but here 's the thing about my grandfather .
underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years .
and even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
but when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather 's example in my own way .
so i just published a book about introversion , and it took me about seven years to write .
and for me , that seven years was like total bliss , because i was reading , i was writing , i was thinking , i was researching .
it was my version of my grandfather 's hours of the day alone in his library .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
and that 's a lot harder for me , because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
i spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance i could get .
and i call this my " year of speaking dangerously . "
and that actually helped a lot .
but i 'll tell you , what helps even more is my sense , my belief , my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude , we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change .
i mean , we are .
and so i am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision .
number one : stop the madness for constant group work .
just stop it .
thank you .
and i want to be clear about what i 'm saying , because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
that is great .
it 's great for introverts and it 's great for extroverts .
but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .
school , same thing .
we need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
this is especially important for extroverted children too .
they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
okay , number two : go to the wilderness .
be like buddha , have your own revelations .
i 'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again , but i am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often .
number three : take a good look at what 's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there .
so extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
or maybe they 're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
whatever it is , i hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
but introverts , you being you , you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what 's inside your own suitcase .
and that 's okay .
but occasionally , just occasionally , i hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see , because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry .
so i wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .

hector ruiz on connecting the world
you know , one of the things that i 'd like to say upfront is that i 'm really here by accident .
and what i mean -- not at ted -- that i 'm -- at this point in my life , truly my set of circumstances i would truly consider an accident .
but what i 'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often .
because i really think , when i look back at how i actually ended up in this accident , technology played a big role in that .
so , what i 'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself , because i 'd like to put in context what i 'm going to tell you .
and i think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education .
and once i put that in context , i 'd like to tell you a little bit about technology : why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler ; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges .
then , about the initiative that chris mentioned , that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 . and then i 'll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today 's world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful .
so , with that in mind , first of all let me tell you , i 'm one of five children . i 'm the oldest , the other four are women .
so i grew up in a family of women .
i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world .
and , as you can imagine , if you can picture this : i was born in a very small village in mexico ,
in , unfortunately , very poor surroundings , and my parents did not have a college education .
but i was fortunate to be able to have one , and so were my four sisters .
that kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education . my parents were fanatics about learning , and i 'll come back to that a little bit later .
but one of the things that exposed me early to learning , and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child , was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a victrola .
my father found that in a junkyard , and was able to repair it and make it work . and somehow -- to this day , i frankly don 't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but , by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old , and playing records in this victrola by mozart , and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever , and how claire de lune , which was one of his favorites , was a real exposure to me to classical music .
he explained to me about johann strauss , and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .
and would tell me a little bit about history too , when he 'd play the 1812 overture by tchaikovsky on this little victrola , and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times and why this music , in some way , represented a little bit of that history .
and even as a child , he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity .
and perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech , but if you can imagine the time when this occurred -- it was in the mid ' 40s -- this was really , in his view , a pretty piece of high tech .
well , one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that , people ask me and say , " well , how did your parents treat you when you were a child ? "
and i always said that they were really tough on me .
and not tough in the sense that most people think of , where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever . they were tough in the sense that , as i grew up , both my mother and father would always say to me , it 's really important that you always remember two things .
first of all , when you go to bed at night , you 've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something , and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could .
and the second thing they said : and we trust you , that no matter where you are or where you go , you will always do the right thing .
now , i don 't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids , but if you do , please trust me , it 's the most pressure you can put on a child , to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .
when i was out with my friends drinking beer , i always was very aware of those words --
-- and very careful . one of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful , of course , but it can only be helpful too if it 's accessible , and in today 's world , being useful , affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today .
so , one of our passions in our company , and now one of my personal passions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
now , technology has changed a lot since the victrola days . you know , we now have , of course , incredibly powerful computers .
a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet .
although frankly speaking , we don 't believe the internet is the killer app .
what we believe is that the internet , frankly , is a connection of people and ideas .
the internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected .
and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome .
and so , we believe that through all the changes that have occurred , that we 're faced today with a tremendous opportunity .
if we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today , the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity , in a useful way ,
accessibility , in an easy manner , and also affordability , that regardless of the economic status that a person could have , that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology .
so , when you look at that , we said , well , we would like to , then , enable that a little bit . we would like to create an initiative .
and a couple of years ago at amd , we came up with this idea of saying , what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 , where we are going to aim , that by the year 2015 , half of the world will be connected to the internet so that people and ideas can get connected .
we knew we couldn 't do it by ourselves , and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at amd could do it alone .
we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments , industry , educational institutions , a myriad of other companies and , frankly , even competitors .
so , it is really a rather lofty initiative , if you want to think that way , but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead , that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently .
and i 'll come back to that in a minute , because i think the results so far have been remarkable , and i can only anticipate and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years , while we get to the 2015 initiative .
where are we today ?
that 's year by year . this comes from our friends at gapminder.com .
those of you who 've never looked at their website , you should look at it . it 's really impressive . and you can see how the internet penetration has changed over the years .
and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well , where are we related to our goal towards 2015 ,
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces .
one is the western world , defined mostly by western europe and the united states , has made an awful lot of progress .
the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good --
has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa . i had the opportunity to have a discussion with president mbeki , and one of the things that we talked about is , what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster ?
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
it is impossible , even in the united states , for that cost , to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach .
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
so , when you look at this chart , you look at the very last -- it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --
you look at the very end : we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent .
but we 're excited in our company ; we 're motivated . we really think it 's a phenomenal driver of things , to force us to do things differently , and we look forward to being able to actually , working with so many partners around the world , to be able to reach that goal .
now , one of the things i 'd like to explain [ about ] 50x15 , which i think is really critical , is that it is not a charity .
it is actually a business venture .
let 's take a small segment of this , of this unconnected world , and call it the education market .
when you look at elementary-school children , we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet .
therefore , when we see that , we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment .
and when we embarked in this initiative , from the very beginning we said it very clearly : this is not a charity .
this is really a business venture , one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market .
because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market , whether it 's education or under-developed nations , either way , it 's a segment that demands incredibly high quality , incredibly high reliability , tremendous low cost and access , and a lot of challenges that frankly , without actually doing it , it would be very difficult to understand , and i 'll explain that in just a minute .
it is an initiative that is focused on simple , accessible and human-centric solutions .
what we mean by that is , you know , frankly , the pc was invented in 1980 , roughly speaking more or less , and for 20-odd years , it hasn 't changed .
it is still , in most places , a gray or black box , and it looks the same .
and frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this , but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it , it would be very difficult to judge who made it , because they 're all highly commoditized but they 're all different .
so , there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market , so we really believe it is critical to think of it .
it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa .
we 're talking about something very similar here .
and it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
in other parts , it doesn 't .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
in other parts , it doesn 't . and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions .
and the last piece , which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have , not shared by many , this is one where we seem to stand alone , on this one --
is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local , integrated , end-to-end ecosystems .
what i mean by that , and let me use this example , the country of south africa , because i was just there , therefore i 'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have .
it 's a country of 45 million people . it 's an economy that 's emerging .
it 's beginning to grow tremendously .
they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity .
they have a computer company that makes computers in south africa .
they 're developing a software-training environment in their universities .
what a place , what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools . and to my surprise , i learned in south africa they have 18 dialects , i always thought they only had two -- english and afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects .
and to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system , it could only be done from inside .
i don 't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets .
so , we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large , and there 's an infrastructure that can provide it , that a local , integrated , end-to-end system is really critical for its success .
this is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in mexico , in my home country .
this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan .
those of you that might be familiar with mexico -- michoacan is a very colorful state .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it 's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa , in a school that 's called nelson mandela school ,
and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers , it 's just phenomenal .
and recently , they 've written us letters , telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives , on their educational dreams , on their capabilities , and it 's just phenomenal .
we have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands .
and i have to tell you that although millions doesn 't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected , it 's a start . and we are learning a lot .
and we 're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
some of you are familiar with this .
this is a partnership between mit and a group of companies -- google is involved , red hat -- and amd is a key player .
the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on amd technology ; it 's a microprocessor .
but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be , one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life .
because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours , and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it .
the engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part , and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --
just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they 're passionate and motivated to be able to do this .
we expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year , and we 're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education .
it 's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market ,
not only in the developing countries , but actually in the developed regions as well , because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient .
we also have partnered with ted in this project , with architecture for humanity , and along with the ted prize winner cameron sinclair , we 're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region .
and we 're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this , and can 't wait to see what comes out of this exciting , exciting activity .
let me come back to the beginning , to end this presentation .
i 'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry , in business ,
is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .
i don 't think it 's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet , and look at numbers and say , yes , that 's a good business .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
and one of the things that i learned , too , from my parents -- and i 'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father .
and it took me a while to understand it , but he said to me , when i went to college , he said , " you 're the first person in the family to go to college .
and it 's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
and therefore , this is your opportunity to do better than my generation . "
frankly , i don 't know that i really understood what he told me at the time . i was eager to go off to college , and go find girls , and study , and girls , and study , but then i finished college and i fell in love . i graduated . i decided to get married .
and on my wedding day , my father came to me again and said , " you know , i 'm going to remind you again , that each generation has to do better than the last one .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that 's how you make progress . " and now he began to make sense .
because i knew what a great husband he was , and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me , like he did when i was a little kid . and then a few years later , i had a child , my first child , and again , my father comes to the hospital , and we 're looking at the glass , and see all the children on the other side , and he said , " i 've got to remind you again , that for each generation to do better ,
you 're going to have to be a better father than i was . "
that 's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me , because he was a great father .
but the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better ,
to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the ceo of a fortune 500 company .
it 's got to be that someday i can look back , and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make .
thank you very much .

rick warren on a life of purpose
i 'm often asked , what surprises you about the book ?
and i said , that i got to write it .
i would have never imagined that , not in my wildest dreams did i think -- i don 't even consider myself to be an author .
and i 'm often asked , why do you think so many people have read this ?
this thing 's selling still about a million copies a month .
and i think it 's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease .
i think inside at some point , we put our heads down on the pillow and we go , " there 's got to be more to life than this . "
get up in the morning , go to work , come home and watch tv , go to bed , get up in the morning , go to work , come home , watch tv , go to bed , go to parties on weekends .
a lot of people say , " i 'm living . " no , you 're not living -- that 's just existing .
just existing .
i really think that 's there 's this inner desire .
i do believe what chris said . i believe that you 're not an accident .
your parents may not have planned you , but i believe god did .
i think there are accidental parents ; there 's no doubt about that .
i don 't think there are accidental kids .
and i think you matter .
i think you matter to god ; i think you matter to history ; i think you matter to this universe .
and i think that the difference between what i call the survival level of living , the success level of living and the significant level of living is , do you figure out , what on earth am i here for ?
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , " but why can 't i figure out my problems ? "
and i meet a lot of people who are very successful , who say , " why don 't i feel more fulfilled ?
why do i feel like a fake ?
why do i feel like i 've got to pretend that i 'm more than i really am ? "
i think that comes down to this issue of meaning , of significance , of purpose .
i think it comes down to this issue of : why am i here ? what am i here for ? where am i going ?
these are not religious issues -- they 're human issues .
i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does , because it makes my life work a whole lot easier .
as a pastor , i do see a lot of kooks .
and i have learned that there are kooks in every area of life .
religion doesn 't have a monopoly on that , but there are plenty of religious kooks .
there are secular kooks ; there are smart kooks , dumb kooks .
there are people -- a lady came up to me the other day , and she had a white piece of paper -- michael , you 'll like this one -- and she said , " what do you see in it ? "
and i looked at it and i said , " oh , i don 't see anything . "
and she goes , " well , i see jesus , " and started crying and left .
i 'm going , ok , you know . fine .
um .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
and that was : what is the purpose of this ?
because it brought in enormous amounts of money .
when you write the best-selling book in the world , it 's tons and tons of money --
and it brought in a lot of attention , neither of which i wanted .
when i started saddleback church , i was 25 years old .
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
and i decided that i was never going to go on tv , because i didn 't want to be a celebrity , i didn 't want to be a , quote , " evangelist , televangelist " -- that 's not my thing .
and all of a sudden , it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention .
i don 't think -- now , this is a worldview , and i will tell you , everybody 's got a worldview .
everybody 's betting their life on something .
you 're betting your life on something -- you just better know why you 're betting what you 're betting on .
so , everybody 's betting their life on something , and when i , you know , made a bet , i happened to believe that jesus was who he said he was .
but everybody 's got -- and i believe in a pluralistic society -- everybody 's betting on something .
and when i started the church , you know , i had no plans to do what it 's doing now .
and then when i wrote this book , and all of a sudden it just took off , then i started saying , now , what 's the purpose of this ?
because as i started to say , i don 't think you 're given money or fame for your own ego , ever .
i just don 't believe that .
and when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is , " it 's not about you , " then , when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history , you got to figure , well , i guess it 's not about me .
that 's kind of a no-brainer .
so , what is it for ?
and i began to think about what i call the " stewardship of affluence " and the " stewardship of influence . "
so i believe , essentially , that leadership is stewardship .
that if you are a leader in any area -- in business , in politics , in sports , in art , in academics , in any area -- you don 't own it ; you are a steward of it .
for instance , that 's why i believe in protecting the environment .
this is not my planet . it wasn 't mine before i was born .
it 's not going to be mine after i die .
i 'm just here for 80 years and then that 's it .
i was debating the other day on a talk show , and the guy was challenging me and go , " what 's a pastor doing on protecting the environment ? "
and i asked this guy , i said , " well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
do you think we have a stewardship here , to take the environment seriously ? "
and he said , " no . "
i said , " oh , you don 't ? " i said , " let me make this clear again .
do you believe that as human beings -- i 'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings , it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation ? "
and he said , " no .
not any more than any other species . "
when he said the word " species , " he was revealing his worldview .
and he was saying , " i 'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is . "
well now , i know a lot of times we act like ducks , but you 're not a duck .
you 're not a duck .
and you are responsible -- that 's my worldview .
and so , you need to understand what your worldview is .
the problem is most people never really think it through .
they never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it , and say , " this is what i believe in .
this is why i believe what i believe . "
i don 't personally have enough faith to be an atheist .
but you may , you may .
your worldview , though , does determine everything else in your life , because it determines your decisions ; it determines your relationships ; it determines your level of confidence .
it determines , really , everything in your life .
what we believe , obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior , and our behavior determines what we become in life .
so all of this money started pouring in , and all of this fame started pouring in , and i go , what do i do with this ?
my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money .
we said , " first , we 're not going to use it on ourselves . "
i didn 't go out and buy a bigger house .
i don 't own a guesthouse .
i still drive the same four-year-old ford that i 've driven .
we just said , we 're not going to use it on us .
the second thing was , i stopped taking a salary from the church that i pastor .
third thing is , i added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years , and i gave it back .
and i gave it back because i didn 't want anybody thinking that i do what i do for money -- i don 't .
in fact , personally , i 've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money .
i know that 's a stereotype . i 've never met one of them .
believe me , there 's a whole lot easier ways to make money .
pastors are like on 24-hours-a-day call . they 're like doctors .
i left late today . i 'd hoped to be here yesterday , because my father-in-law is in his last , probably , 48 hours before he dies of cancer .
and i 'm watching a guy who 's lived his life -- he 's now in his mid-80s -- and he 's dying with peace . you know , the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times .
the test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral .
and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals , it makes a difference .
it makes a difference what you believe .
so , we gave it all back , and then we set up three foundations , working on some of the major problems of the world : illiteracy , poverty , pandemic diseases -- particularly hiv / aids -- and set up these three foundations , and put the money into that .
the last thing we did is we became what i call " reverse tithers . "
and that is , when my wife and i got married 30 years ago , we started tithing .
now , that 's a principle in the bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity , give it away to help other people .
so , we started doing that , and each year we would raise our tithe 1 percent .
so , our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent , second year we went to 12 percent , and the third year we went to 13 percent , and on and on and on . why did i do that ?
because every time i give , it breaks the grip of materialism in my life .
materialism is all about getting -- get , get , get , get all you can , can all you get , sit on the can and spoil the rest .
it 's all about more , having more .
and we think that the good life is actually looking good --
that 's most important of all -- looking good , feeling good and having the goods .
but that 's not the good life .
i meet people all the time who have those , and they 're not necessarily happy .
if money actually made you happy , then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest .
and that i know , personally , i know , is not true .
it 's just not true .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ;
it 's about being good and doing good .
giving your life away .
significance in life doesn 't come from status , because you can always find somebody who 's got more than you .
it doesn 't come from sex .
it doesn 't come from salary .
it comes from serving .
it is in giving our lives away that we find meaning , we find significance .
that 's the way we were wired , i believe , by god .
and so we began to give away , and now after 30 years , my wife and i are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10 .
that , actually , was the easy part .
the hard part is , what do i do with all this attention ?
because i start getting all kinds of invitations .
i just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents , and i won 't go into that , but it was an amazing thing .
and i 'm going , what do i do with this notoriety that the book has brought ?
and being a pastor , i started reading the bible .
there 's a chapter in the bible called psalm 72 , and it 's solomon 's prayer for more influence .
when you read this prayer , it sounds incredibly selfish , self-centered .
it sounds like , he says , " god , i want you to make me famous . "
that 's what he prays .
he says , " i want you to make me famous .
i want you to spread the fame of my name through every land . i want you to give me power . i want you to make me famous .
i want you to give me influence . "
and it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray .
until you read the whole psalm , the whole chapter .
and then he says , " so that the king " -- he was the king of israel at that time at its apex in power -- " so that the king may care for the widow and orphan , support depressed , defend the defenseless , care for the sick , assist the poor , speak up for the foreigner , those in prison . "
basically , he 's talking about all the marginalized in society .
and as i read that , i looked at it , and i thought , you know , what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
the purpose of influence is not to build your ego , or your net worth .
and , by the way , your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth .
your value is not based on your valuables ; it 's based on a whole different set of things .
and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
and i had to admit , i can 't think of the last time i thought of widows and orphans .
they 're not on my radar .
i pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of america -- a bunch of gated communities .
i have a church full of ceos and scientists .
and i could go five years and never , ever see a homeless person .
they 're just not in my pathway .
now , they 're 13 miles up the road in santa ana .
so , i had to say , " ok , i would use whatever affluence and whatever influence i 've got to help those who don 't have either of those . "
you know , there 's a story in the bible about moses .
whether you believe it 's true or not -- it really didn 't matter to me .
but moses , if you saw the movie , " the ten commandments , " moses goes out , and there 's this burning bush , and god talks to him .
and god says , " moses , what 's in your hand ? "
i think that 's one of the most important questions you 'll ever be asked .
what 's in your hand ?
moses says , " it 's a staff .
it 's a shepherd 's staff . "
and god says , " throw it down . "
and if you saw the movie , you know , he throws it down and it becomes a snake .
and then god says , " pick it up . "
and he picks it back up again , and it becomes a staff again .
now , i 'm reading this thing , and i 'm going , what is that all about ?
ok . what 's that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things .
number one , god never does a miracle to show off .
it 's not just , " wow , isn 't that cool ? "
and , by the way , my god doesn 't have to show up on cheese bread .
you know , if god 's going to show up , he 's not going to show up on cheese bread .
ok ? i just , this is why i love what michael does , because it 's like , ok , if he 's debunking it , then i don 't have to .
but god -- my god -- doesn 't show up on sprinkler images .
he got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do .
but he doesn 't do miracles just to show off .
second thing is , if god ever asks you a question , he already knows the answer .
obviously , if he 's god , then that would mean that when he asks the question , it 's for your benefit , not his .
so , he 's going , " what 's in your hand ? "
now , what was in moses ' hand ?
well , it was a shepherd 's staff . now , follow me on this .
this staff represented three things about moses ' life .
first , it represented his identity .
he was a shepherd . it 's the symbol of his own occupation .
i am a shepherd . it 's a symbol of his identity , his career , his job .
second , it 's a symbol of not only his identity ; it 's a symbol of his income , because all of his assets are tied up in sheep .
in those days nobody had bank accounts , or american express cards , or hedge funds .
your assets are tied up in your flocks .
so it 's a symbol of his identity , and it 's a symbol of his income .
and the third thing : it 's a symbol of his influence .
what do you do with a shepherd 's staff ?
well , you know , you move sheep from point a to point b with it , by hook or by crook .
you pull them or you poke them , one or the other .
so , he 's saying , " you 're going to lay down your identity .
what 's in your hand ? you 've got identity ; you 've got income ; you 've got influence .
what 's in your hand ? "
and he 's saying , " if you lay it down , i 'll make it come alive .
i 'll do some things you could never imagine possible . "
and if you 've watched that movie , " ten commandments , " all of those big miracles that happen in egypt are done through this staff .
last year , i was invited to speak at nba all-stars game .
and so , i 'm talking to the players , because most of the nba teams , nfl teams and all the other teams have done this 40 days of purpose , based on the book .
and i asked them , i said , " what 's in your hand ?
so , what 's in your hand ? " i said , " it 's a basketball , and that basketball represents your identity , who you are .
you 're an nba player . it represents your income .
you 're making a lot of money off that little ball .
and it represents your influence .
and even though you 're only going to be in the nba for a few years , you 're going to be an nba player for the rest of your life .
and that gives with you enormous influence .
so , what are you going to do with what you 've been given ? "
and i guess that 's the main reason i came up here today , to all of you very bright people at ted , is to say , " what 's in your hand ? "
what do you have that you 've been given ?
talent , background , education , freedom , networks , opportunities , wealth , ideas , creativity .
what are you doing with what you 've been given ?
that , to me , is the primary question about life .
that , to me , is what being purpose-driven is all about .
in the book i talk about how you 're wired to do certain things , you 're shaped .
this little cross takes spiritual gifts , heart , ability , personality and experiences .
these things shape you .
and if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life , you need to look at your shape . what am i wired to do ?
why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?
if you 're wired to be an anthropologist , you 'll be an anthropologist .
if you 're wired to be an undersea explorer , you 'll be an undersea explorer .
if you 're wired to make deals , you make deals .
if you 're wired to paint , you paint .
did you know that god smiles when you be you ?
when my little kids were little -- they 're all grown , now i have grandkids -- i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed , and i used to watch my kids sleep .
and i just watched their little bodies rise and lower , rise and lower .
and i would look at them -- this is not an accident .
rise and lower --
and i got joy out of just watching them sleep .
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you 're doing , quote , " spiritual things , " like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
the bottom line is , god gets pleasure watching you be you . why ?
he made you . and when you do what you were made to do , he goes , " that 's my boy .
that 's my girl .
you 're using the talent and ability that i gave you . "
so my advice to you is , look at what 's in your hand -- your identity , your influence , your income -- and say , " it 's not about me .
it 's about making the world a better place . "
thank you .

ted follows nicholas negroponte to colombia as he delivers laptops inside territory once controlled by guerrillas . his partner ? colombia 's defense department , who see one laptop per child as an investment in the region .

negroponte takes olpc to colombia
it 's amazing , when you meet a head of state and you say , " what is your most precious natural resource ? " -- they will not say children at first .
and then when you say children , they will pretty quickly agree with you .
: we 're traveling today with the minister of defense of colombia , head of the army and the head of the police , and we 're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television , no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years .
the importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the farc , the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement .
there are one billion children in the world , and 50 percent of them don 't have electricity at home or at school .
and in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don 't go to school .
and i don 't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don 't go .
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype , it 's gone from an idea to a real laptop .
we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children , and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .
so , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
that 's smaller than i predicted -- i predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number .
in colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
it 's the minister of defense with whom we 're working , not the minister of education , because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years ' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived .
and suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
they 've leapfrogged .
the change is absolutely monumental , because it 's not just opening it up , but it 's opening it up to the rest of the world .
so yes , they 're building roads , yes , they 're putting in telephone , yes , there will be television .
but the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the internet in spanish and in local languages , so the children grow up with access to information , with a window into the rest of the world .
before , they were closed off .
interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth .
and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .
it 's not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it 's an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
thirty-one countries in total are involved , and in the case of uruguay , half the children already have them , and by the middle of 2009 , every single child in uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop .
now what are some of the results ?
some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much , and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets .
probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents .
they own the laptops . they take them home .
and so when i met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to bogota , one of the three children brought her mother .
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and this is such an inversion , and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change .
so now , in closing , people say , now why laptops ?
laptops are a luxury ; it 's like giving them ipods . no .
the reason you want laptops is that the word is education , not laptop .
this is an education project , not a laptop project .
they need to learn learning . and then , just think -- they can have , let 's say , 100 books .
in a village , you have 100 laptops , each with a different set of 100 books , and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books .
you and i didn 't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth-grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway .
so we 're once again doing " give one , get one . " last year , we ran a " give one , get one " program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops
that we were then able to give free .
and by being a zero-dollar laptop , we can go to countries that can 't afford it at all .
and that 's what we did . we went to haiti , we went to rwanda , afghanistan , ethiopia , mongolia .
places that are not markets , seeding it with the principles of saturation , connectivity , low ages , etc .
and then we can actually roll out large numbers .
so think of it this way : think of it as inoculating children against ignorance .
and think of the laptop as a vaccine .
you don 't vaccinate a few children .
you vaccinate all the children in an area .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / kathryn _ schulz _ on _ being _ wrong.html
most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong . but what if we 're wrong about that ? " wrongologist " kathryn schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility .
culture , failure

kathryn schulz : on being wrong
so it 's 1995 , i 'm in college , and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence , rhode island to portland , oregon .
and you know , we 're young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
" what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road ? "
my friend looks at me totally blankly .
there 's actually a gentleman in the front row who 's doing a perfect imitation of her look .
and i 'm like , " you know , all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them . " she just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what i 'm talking about .
and what i 'm talking about is this . right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
i 've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
in other words , as you heard chris say , i 've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
this might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
in fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
we get it in the abstract .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
the human species , in general , is fallible -- okay fine .
but when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs i hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and i can 't actually think of anything i 'm wrong about .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
we go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
i think this is a problem .
i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
so what i want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
and second , why it 's such a problem .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
one reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
so let me ask you guys something -- or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you 're right here : how does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong ?
dreadful . thumbs down .
embarrassing . okay , wonderful , great .
dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing -- thank you , these are great answers , but they 're answers to a different question .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you 're wrong ?
realizing you 're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
i mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid chinese character mistake .
but just being wrong doesn 't feel like anything .
i 'll give you an analogy .
do you remember that loony tunes cartoon where there 's this pathetic coyote who 's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
in pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine -- he 's a bird , he can fly .
but the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
and what 's funny -- at least if you 're six years old -- is that the coyote 's totally fine too .
he just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid-air .
that 's when he falls .
when we 're wrong about something -- not when we realize it , but before that -- we 're like that coyote after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
you know , we 're already wrong , we 're already in trouble , but we feel like we 're on solid ground .
so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago .
it does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
so this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
i call this error blindness .
most of the time , we don 't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we 're wrong about something , until it 's too late .
but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
think back for a moment to elementary school .
you 're sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
this is not mine , by the way .
so there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
it 's the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
so by the time you are nine years old , you 've already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
and a lot of us -- and i suspect , especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
right , mr. cfo , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
you 're all cfo , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
okay , so fine .
except that then we freak out at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong .
because according to this , getting something wrong means there 's something wrong with us .
so we just insist that we 're right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
so let me tell you a story .
a couple of years ago , a woman comes into beth israel deaconess medical center for a surgery .
beth israel 's in boston .
it 's the teaching hospital for harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country .
so this woman comes in and she 's taken into the operating room .
she 's anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
everything seems to have gone fine .
and she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , " why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? "
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
he said , " for whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . " the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
and when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that 's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
so this is a huge practical problem .
but it 's also a huge social problem .
think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
and when you feel that way , you 've got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
it turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they 're ignorant .
they don 't have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team .
when that doesn 't work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they 're idiots .
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
and when that doesn 't work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
so this is a catastrophe .
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
but to me , what 's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
that is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
the miracle of your mind isn 't that you can see the world as it is .
it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't .
we can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it 's like to be some other person in some other place .
and we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
and yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
1,200 years before descartes said his famous thing about " i think therefore i am , " this guy , st. augustine , sat down and wrote " fallor ergo sum " -- " i err therefore i am . "
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
it 's totally fundamental to who we are .
because , unlike god , we don 't really know what 's going on out there .
and unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
to me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
last year , for various reasons , i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life .
and so i 'm listening and i 'm listening , and at some point , i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
and my first thought was , " i 've lost it .
i 've become the crazy wrongness lady . i just imagined it everywhere , " which has happened .
but a couple of months later , i actually had a chance to interview ira glass , who 's the host of the show .
and i mentioned this to him , and he was like , " no actually , that 's true .
in fact , " he says , " as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
and the crypto-theme is : ' i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . ' and the thing is , " says ira glass , " we need this .
we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . " and for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
but , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .
and something else happened instead .
and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
and something else happened instead .
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
and something else happened instead .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
and something else happened instead .
i mean , this is life .
for good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
no offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
because half the stuff that 's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- ted 1998 -- eh .
didn 't really work out that way , did it ?
where 's my jet pack , chris ?
so here we are again .
and that 's how it goes .
we come up with another idea .
we tell another story .
we hold another conference .
the theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
and to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , " wow , i don 't know .
maybe i 'm wrong . " thank you .
thank you guys .

juan enriquez wants to grow energy
what is bioenergy ? bioenergy is not ethanol .
bioenergy isn 't global warming . bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . bioenergy is oil . it 's gas . it 's coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
so we 've been planting stuff for 11,000 years . and in the measure that we plant stuff , what we learn from agriculture is you 've got to deal with pests , you 've got to deal with all types of awful things , you 've got to cultivate stuff . in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate , then you 're going to be able to spread beyond the nile .
you 're going to be able to power stuff , so irrigation makes a difference .
irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it , as opposed to where the rivers flood . you start getting this organic agriculture ; you start putting machinery onto this stuff . machinery , with a whole bunch of water , leads to very large-scale agriculture .
you put together machines and water , and you get landscapes that look like this . and then you get sales that look like this . it 's brute force . so what you 've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that 's a reasonably natural system . you start taming that natural system . you put a lot of force behind that natural system . you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system , and you end up with systems that look like this .
and it 's all brute force . and that 's the way we 've been approaching energy . so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that 's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology . and you move from a discipline of engineering , you move from a discipline of chemistry , into a discipline of biology . and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me .
this is a guy called norman borlaug . he won the nobel prize . he 's got the congressional medal of honor . he deserves all of this stuff . and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds . he did this in mexico . the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution . that is something that a lot of people have criticized . but of course , those are people who don 't realize that china and india , instead of having huge amounts of starving people , are exporting grains .
and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research , which was mexico , didn 't adopt this technology , ignored this technology , talked about why this technology should be thought about , but not really applied .
and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn 't apply technology that was discovered in mexico . and in fact , hasn 't recognized this man , to the point where there aren 't statues of this man all over mexico . there are in china and india . and the
institute that this guy ran has now moved to india . that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies .
now , it 's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world . it 's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does , if you understand biology .
what happened in agriculture ? well , if you take agriculture over a century , agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier . yeah , the plows look different . the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules , but the farmer would have understood : this is what the guy 's doing , this is why he 's doing it , this is where he 's going . what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology , and that 's where you get your productivity increases . and as you do that stuff , here 's what happens to productivity .
basically , you go from 250 hours to produce 100 bushels , to 40 , to 15 , to five . agricultural labor productivity increased seven times , 1950 to 2000 , whereas the rest of the economy increased about 2.5 times . this is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person .
the effect of this , of course , is it 's not just amber waves of grain , it is mountains of stuff .
and 50 percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced .
this would be a good outcome for energy . and of
course , by now , you 're probably saying to yourself , " self , i thought i came to a talk about energy and here 's this guy talking about biology . "
so where 's the link between these two things ?
one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we don 't understand . we don 't even know what oil is . we
don 't know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes
from . the best assumption , and one of the best guesses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
now , the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil , and all hydrocarbons , turned out to be concentrated sunlight . and if you think of bioenergy , bioenergy isn 't ethanol . bioenergy is taking the sun , concentrating it in amoebas , concentrating it in plants , and maybe that 's why you get these rainbows .
and as you 're looking at this system , if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight , then bioenergy works in a different way . and we 've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels .
maybe that 's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas , the types of wells that you 're beginning to see don 't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots .
this is how you farm oil . and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved , we started with this brute force approach . and then what did we learn ? then we learned we had to go bigger . and then what 'd we learn ? then we have to go even bigger . and we are getting really destructive as we 're going out and farming this bioenergy .
these are the athabasca tar sands , and there 's an enormous amount -- first of mining , the largest trucks in the world are working here , and then you 've got to pull out this black sludge , which is basically oil that doesn 't flow . it 's tied to the sand . and then you 've got to use a lot of steam to separate it , which only works at today 's oil prices .
coal . coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff . it is probably plants , except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don 't know .
which is curious as we debate all this stuff . but as you think of coal , this is what burned wheat kernels look like . not entirely unlike coal .
and of course , coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines , you get gas . when that gas blows up , people die . so you 're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines , but not in others .
any place you see a differential , there 're some interesting questions . there 's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . but again , coal . maybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bioenergy , and you 're applying exactly the same technology .
here 's your brute force approach . once you get through your brute force approach , then you just rip off whole mountaintops . and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions , which are coal-fired gas plants . that is probably not the best use of bioenergy .
as you think of what are the alternatives to this system -- it 's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u.s. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves , but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves , nor is china . there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there , and we 've got to start thinking of them as biological energy , because if we keep treating them as chemical energy , or engineering energy , we 're going to be in deep doo-doo .
gas is a similar issue . gas is also a biological product . and as you think of gas , well , you 're familiar with gas . and here 's a different way of mining coal .
this is called coal bed methane . why is this picture interesting ? because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life , the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there 's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas .
this is a well-known phenomenon . you eat certain things , you produce a lot of gas . it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process . if that is true , then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off , and it may not be to burn coal . it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture .
that is what bioenergy is . it is not ethanol . it is not subsidies to a few companies . it is not importing corn into iowa because you 've built so many of these ethanol plants . it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture , from brute force into biological force . and in the measure that you can do that , you can clean some stuff , and you can clean it pretty quickly .
we already have some indicators of productivity on
this stuff . ok , if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades , you can get a really substantial increase , like an eight-fold increase , in your output . this is just the beginning stages of this stuff .
and as you think of biomaterials , this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome , who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this . and there 's a series of smart people thinking about this . and they 've been putting together companies like synthetic genomics , like , a cambria , like codon , and what those companies are trying to do is to think of , how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force ?
think of it in the following terms . think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes . think of the cell as a hardware . think of the genes as a software . and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable , that can become energy , that can become food , that can become fiber , that can become human beings , that can become a whole series of things , then you 've got to shift your approach as to how you 're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way .
what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading ? this is one of the gentle giants on the planet . he 's one of the nicest human beings you 've ever met . his name is hamilton smith . he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes .
he was at hopkins when he did this , and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won , his mother called him and said , " i didn 't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins . do you know he just won the nobel ? " i mean , that was mom ,
but anyway , this guy is just a class act . you find him at the bench every single day , working on a pipette and building stuff . and one of the things this guy just built are these things .
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , insert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that 's one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are , we 're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies . we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy . it is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms .
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta . these are sulfur blocks . because as you separate that petroleum from the sand , and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur . the difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well , it 's about 14 bucks a barrel . that 's why you 're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks . and by the way , the scale on these things is pretty large .
now , if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this , you reduce the system , and you really do start applying biological principles to energy . this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind , to the point where you can get to solar , to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault . just a thought .
but in the meantime , for the next decade at least , the name of the game is hydrocarbons . and be that oil , be that gas , be that coal , this is what we 're dealing with . and before i make this talk too long , here 's what 's happening in the current energy system .
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons . that means 86 percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff . and there 's a role in here for conservation . there 's a role in here for alternative stuff , but we 've also got to get that other portion right .
how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future . and as we think of this bridge to the future , one of the things you should ponder is : we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells . so we 're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there . which , of course , requires more energy to go out and get energy . the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol . it may even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and the energy output . that is a stupid way of managing this system .
last point , last graph . one of the things that we 've got to do is to stabilize oil prices . this is what oil prices look like , ok ?
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low . people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels , or for wind , or for something else , and then guess what ?
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
so if i had one closing and modest suggestion , let 's set a stable oil price in europe and the united states . how do you do that ? well , let 's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax , and it basically says for the next 20 years , the price of oil will be -- whatever you want , 35 bucks , 40 bucks . if the opec price falls below that , we tax it . if the opec price goes above that , the tax goes away .
what does that do for entrepreneurs ? what does it do for companies ? it tells people , if you can produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel , or less than 40 bucks a barrel , or less than 50 bucks a barrel -- let 's debate it -- you will have a business . but let 's not put people through this cycle where it doesn 't pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening . thank you .

when the dotcom bubble burst , hotelier chip conley went in search of a business model based on happiness . in an old friendship with an employee and in the wisdom of a buddhist king , he learned that success comes from what you count .

chip conley : measuring what makes life worthwhile
i 'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century .
in the 21st century , we need to actually look at -- and what i 'm actually going to encourage you to consider today -- is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count .
but i think it 's time for us to think about what we count .
because what we actually count truly counts .
let me start by telling you a little story .
this is van quach .
she came to this country in 1986 from vietnam .
she changed her name to vivian because she wanted to fit in here in america .
her first job was at an inner-city motel in san francisco as a maid .
i happened to buy that motel about three months after vivian started working there .
so vivian and i have been working together for 23 years .
with the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old , in 1987 , i started my company and i called it joie de vivre , a very impractical name , because i actually was looking to create joy of life .
and this first hotel that i bought , motel , was a pay-by-the-hour , no-tell motel in the inner-city of san francisco .
as i spent time with vivian , i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
so i spent time with vivian , and i saw that she didn 't find joy in cleaning toilets .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber .
what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests .
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
in the wake of the dotcom crash and 9 / 11 , san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels .
we were the largest operator of hotels in the bay area , so we were particularly vulnerable .
but also back then , remember we stopped eating french fries in this country .
well , not exactly , of course not .
we started eating " freedom fries , "
and we started boycotting anything that was french .
well , my name of my company , joie de vivre --
so i started getting these letters from places like alabama and orange county saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a french company .
and i 'd write them back , and i 'd say , " what a minute . we 're not french .
we 're an american company . we 're based in san francisco . "
and i 'd get a terse response : " oh , that 's worse . "
so one particular day when i was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre , i ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices .
and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .
but given my befuddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
that 's where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow 's " hierarchy of needs . "
i took one psychology class in college , and i learned about this guy , abraham maslow , as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs .
but as i sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading maslow , i recognized something that is true of most leaders .
one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect ,
and that is that we 're all human .
each of us , no matter what our role is in business , has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .
so as i started reading more maslow , what i started to realize is that maslow , later in his life , wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective , to organizations and specifically to business .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 ,
and so he wasn 't really able to live that dream completely .
so i realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel abe maslow .
and that 's what i did a few years ago when i took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
it 's not just fundamental in business , it 's fundamental in life .
and we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs , these transformational needs for our key employees in the company .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of maslow 's hierarchy of needs .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , i realized we had no metrics .
we had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right .
so we started asking ourselves : what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees ' sense of meaning , or our customers ' sense of emotional connection with us ?
for example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?
we started asking our customers , did they feel an emotional connection with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways .
miraculously , as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid , what we found is we created more loyalty .
our customer loyalty skyrocketed .
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average ,
and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size .
as i went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time , what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
they didn 't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so i started asking myself the question : how can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible ?
if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
so i went out and studied a bunch of things ,
and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business , things like intellectual property , their corporate culture , their brand loyalty ,
and yet , only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .
so as leaders , we understand that intangibles are important , but we don 't have a clue how to measure them .
so here 's another einstein quote : " not everything that can be counted counts , and not everything that counts can be counted . "
i hate to argue with einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can 't be counted or valued , aren 't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane ?
it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks .
i flew off to a place that 's been shrouded in mystery for centuries , a place some folks call shangri-la .
it 's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
i went to bhutan .
the teenage king of bhutan was also a curious man , but this was back in 1972 , when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind .
on a trip through india , early in his reign as king , he was asked by an indian journalist about the bhutanese gdp , the size of the bhutanese gdp .
the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
he said the following , he said : " why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product ?
why don 't we care more about gross national happiness ? "
now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as gnh , or gross national happiness .
most world leaders didn 't take notice , and those that did thought this was just " buddhist economics . "
but the king was serious .
this was a notable moment , because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness -- that leader 200 years ago , thomas jefferson with the declaration of independence -- 200 years later , this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure , and it 's something we should actually value as government officials .
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan --
including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
bhutan , for those of you who don 't know it , is the newest democracy in the world , just two years ago .
so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement , i got to really understand what they 're doing .
and i got to spend some time with the prime minister .
over dinner , i asked him an impertinent question .
i asked him , " how can you create and measure something which evaporates -- in other words , happiness ? "
and he 's a very wise man , and he said , " listen , bhutan 's goal is not to create happiness .
we create the conditions for happiness to occur .
in other words , we create a habitat of happiness . "
wow , that 's interesting .
he said that they have a science behind that art ,
and they 've actually created four essential pillars , nine key indicators and 72 different metrics that help them to measure their gnh .
one of those key indicators is : how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?
it 's a good question . how do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world .
and yet , of course , that little intangible piece of data doesn 't factor into our gdp calculations .
as i spent my week up in the himalayas , i started to imagine what i call an emotional equation .
and it focuses on something i read long ago from a guy named rabbi hyman schachtel .
how many know him ? anybody ?
1954 , he wrote a book called " the real enjoyment of living , "
and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want ;
instead , it 's about wanting what you have .
or in other words , i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .
the bhutanese aren 't on some aspirational treadmill , constantly focused on what they don 't have .
their religion , their isolation , their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their gnh movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have .
how many of us here , as tedsters in the audience , spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation , in the denominator ?
we are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many dictionaries define pursuit as to " chase with hostility . "
do we pursue happiness with hostility ?
good question . but back to bhutan .
bhutan 's bordered on its north and south by 38 percent of the world 's population .
could this little country , like a startup in a mature industry , be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle-class in china and india ?
bhutan 's created the ultimate export , a new global currency of well-being ,
and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh .
you may have heard , this last fall nicolas sarkozy in france announcing the results of an 18-month study by two nobel economists , focusing on happiness and wellness in france .
sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on gdp and consider a new index , what some french are calling a " joie de vivre index . "
i like it .
co-branding opportunities .
just three days ago , three days ago here at ted , we had a simulcast of david cameron , potentially the next prime minister of the uk , quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time , robert kennedy 's poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we 're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that gdp is a misplaced metric .
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
i 've taken that robert kennedy quote , and i 've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here .
this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
gdp counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods .
but it doesn 't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials .
as you look at these two columns here , doesn 't it make you feel like it 's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count , a new way to imagine what 's important to us in life ?
certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
he said gdp " measures everything in short , except that which makes life worthwhile . "
wow .
so how do we do that ?
let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now , at least in this country .
why in the heck in america are we doing a census in 2010 ?
we 're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
we 're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
but all of those questions are tangible .
they 're about demographics .
they 're about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not .
that 's about it .
we 're not asking meaningful metrics .
we 're not asking important questions .
we 're not asking anything that 's intangible .
abe maslow said long ago something you 've heard before , but you didn 't realize it was him .
he said , " if the only tool you have is a hammer , everything starts to look like a nail . "
we 've been fooled by our tool .
excuse that expression .
we 've been fooled by our tool .
gdp has been our hammer .
and our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success .
and yet , 64 percent of the world 's gdp today is in that intangible industry we call service , the service industry , the industry i 'm in .
and only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture .
so maybe it 's time that we get a bigger toolbox , right ?
maybe it 's time we get a toolbox that doesn 't just count what 's easily counted , the tangible in life , but actually counts what we most value , the things that are intangible .
i guess i 'm sort of a curious ceo .
i was also a curious economics major as an undergrad .
i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
they aren 't the same .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
in vivian 's case , her unit of production isn 't the tangible hours she works ,
it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .
this is dave arringdale who 's actually been a longtime guest at vivian 's motel .
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years ,
and he 's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .
they 've created a habitat of happiness for dave .
he tells me that he can always count on vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home . why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don 't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business ?
we don 't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits ,
we can have both .
in fact , inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits , right ?
so what the world needs now , in my opinion , is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count .
we count numbers .
we count on people .
what really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people .
i learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country .
what can you start counting today ?
what one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life , whether it 's your work life or your business life ?
thank you very much .

what do science and play have in common ? neuroscientist beau lotto thinks all people should participate in science and , through the process of discovery , change perceptions . he 's seconded by 12-year-old amy o 'toole , who , along with 25 of her classmates , published the first peer-reviewed article by schoolchildren , about the blackawton bees project . it starts : " once upon a time ... "

beau lotto + amy o 'toole : science is for everyone , kids included
beau lotto : so , this game is very simple .
all you have to do is read what you see . right ?
so , i 'm going to count to you , so we don 't all do it together .
okay , one , two , three . audience : can you read this ?
bl : amazing . what about this one ? one , two , three . audience : you are not reading this .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
if you were portuguese , right ? how about this one ? one , two , three .
audience : what are you reading ?
bl : what are you reading ? there are no words there .
i said , read what you 're seeing . right ?
it literally says , " wat ar ou rea in ? " right ?
that 's what you should have said . right ? why is this ?
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
right ? the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what 's there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
all right ? which means , when it comes to perception , we 're all like this frog .
right ? it 's getting information . it 's generating behavior that 's useful .
man : ow ! ow !
bl : and sometimes , when things don 't go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
but we 're talking about perception here , right ?
and perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before .
but actually , it 's a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
now , i want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
they begin with a question .
the problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it 's evolutionarily a bad thing . if you 're not sure that 's a predator , it 's too late .
okay ?
even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty . right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving . your eyes , because it 's moving in register with the boat , say i 'm standing still .
your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
the question " why ? " is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
so how can we ever do anything new ? well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
and it enables us to address even the most difficult they 're the ones that question the things we think to be true already . right ?
it 's easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
so what is evolution 's answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
it 's play .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes play fun .
right ? it 's adaptable to change . right ? it opens possibility , and it 's cooperative . it 's actually how we do our social bonding , and it 's intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
it 's actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
so armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
and who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
because they 're experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right ?
the first step was to ask a question .
now , i should say that we didn 't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it .
so we did it anyway . right ? of course .
so , here are some of the questions . i put them in small print so you wouldn 't bother reading it . point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . right ?
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
she was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . right ? she will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted . right ?
now , science and asking questions is about courage .
now she is the personification of courage , because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all .
so amy , would you please come up ?
so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project , and first she 's going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
amy o 'toole : thank you , beau . we thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
but we wondered if there 's a possible link with other animals . it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . so what if bees can think like us ?
well , it 'd be amazing , since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
but it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from .
bl : so the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . so the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so -- well , game -- and so , amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
ao : the puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
we asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern .
they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . the interesting question is , which ?
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
it was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults .
bl : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing , because that 's what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . okay ?
so i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students doing the observations . they 're recording the data of where the bees fly .
dave strudwick : so what we 're going to do - student : 5c .
dave strudwick : is she still going up here ? student : yeah .
dave strudwick : so you keep track of each . student : henry , can you help me here ?
bl : " can you help me , henry ? " what good scientist says that , right ?
student : there 's two up there .
and three in here .
bl : right ? so we 've got our observations . we 've got our data .
they do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
and now we want to share . that 's the next step .
so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this
for publication . right ? so we have to write it up .
so we go , of course , to the pub . all right ?
the one on the left is mine , okay ?
now , i tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
the introduction says , what 's the question and why ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
and the discussion is , who cares ? right ?
that 's a science paper , basically .
so the kids give me the words , right ? i put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
it 's not written by me . it 's written by amy and the other students in the class . as a consequence , this science paper begins , " once upon a time ... " the results section , it says : " training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . " right ?
and the methods , it says , " then we put the bees into the fridge , " smiley face . right ?
this is a science paper . we 're going to try to get it published .
so here 's the title page . we have a number of authors there .
all the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be " blackawton et al , " and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
" i 'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . " in other words , it starts off " once upon a time , " the figures are in crayon , etc .
so we said , we 'll get it reviewed . so i sent it to dale purves , who is at the national academy of science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , " this is the most original science paper i have ever read " - - " and it certainly deserves wide exposure . " larry maloney , expert in vision , says , " the paper is magnificent .
the work would be publishable if done by adults . " so what did we do ? we send it back to the editor .
they say no .
so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to biology letters .
and there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . okay ?
it took four months to do the science , two years to get it published .
typical science , actually , right ? so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
what was the feedback like ?
well , it was published two days before christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
it was the editors ' choice in science , which is a top science magazine .
it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters .
it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by biology letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
and i 'll just read one .
" i have read ' blackawton bees ' recently . i don 't have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now .
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
who else can have these qualities more than children ?
please congratulate your children 's team from my side . " so i 'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
can i do it on you ?
oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . yeah yeah . okay .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
for me , not for him . right ? because we 've only done this once before .
and you like technology , right ?
shimon schocken : right , but i like myself .
bl : this is the epitome of technology . right . okay .
now ...
okay .
now , we 're going to do a little demonstration , right ?
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . all right ?
okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . one , two , three ?
audience : brilliant . now , open your eyes . we 'll do it one more time .
everyone over there shout .
where 's the sound coming from ?
thank you very much .
what 's the point ? the point is what science does for us .
right ? we normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . when he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
that 's what science offers us . it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i 've asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
so , amy ?
ao : this project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and i mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
but changing the way i thought about science was surprisingly easy . once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , i then realized that science isn 't just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of beau , and the blackawton bee project .
thank you . bl : thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / van _ jones _ the _ economic _ injustice _ of _ plastic.html
van jones lays out a case against plastic pollution from the perspective of social justice . because plastic trash , he shows us , hits poor people and poor countries " first and worst , " with consequences we all share no matter where we live and what we earn . at tedxgpgp , he offers a few powerful ideas to help us reclaim our throwaway planet .

van jones : the economic injustice of plastic
i am honored to be here , and i 'm honored to talk about this topic , which i think is of grave importance .
we 've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species , but plastic hurts people too , especially poor people .
and both in the production of plastic , the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic , the people who have the bull 's-eye on their foreheads are poor people .
people got very upset when the bp oil spill happened for very good reason .
people thought about , " oh , my god .
this is terrible , this oil -- it 's in the water .
it 's going to destroy the living systems there .
people are going to be hurt .
this is a terrible thing , that the oil is going to hurt the people in the gulf . "
what people don 't think about is : what if the oil had made it safely to shore ?
what if the oil actually got where it was trying to go ?
not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming , but there 's a place called " cancer alley , " and the reason it 's called " cancer alley " is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and , in the process , kills people .
it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf .
so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there 's a spill ; they 're a problem where there 's not .
and what we don 't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products .
the other thing that we don 't often appreciate is it 's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer .
poor people also suffer at the point of use .
those of us who earn a certain income level , we have something called choice .
the reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices , economic choices .
we actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous , poisonous plastic in them .
other people who are poor don 't have those choices .
so low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using .
those are the people who wind up actually ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic and using it .
and people say , " well , they should just buy a different product . "
well , the problem with being poor is you don 't have those choices .
you often have to buy the cheapest products .
the cheapest products are often the most dangerous .
and if that weren 't bad enough , if it wasn 't just the production of plastic that 's giving people cancer in places like " cancer alley " and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use , at the point of disposal , once again , it 's poor people who bear the burden .
often , we think we 're doing a good thing .
you 're in your office , and you 're drinking your bottled water , or whatever it is , and you think to yourself , " hey , i 'm going to throw this away .
no , i 'm going to be virtuous .
i 'm going to put it in the blue bin . "
you think , " i put mine in the blue bin , "
and then you look at your colleague and say , " why , you cretin .
you put yours in the white bin . "
and we use that as a moral tickle .
we feel so good about ourselves .
maybe i 'll feel good myself .
not you , but i feel this way .
and so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .
but if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey , we would be shocked to discover that , all too often , that bottle is going to be put on a boat ,
it 's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense ,
and it 's going to wind up in a developing country -- often china .
i think in our minds we imagine somebody 's going to take the little bottle , say , " oh , little bottle . we 're so happy to see you , little bottle . "
" you 've served so well . "
he 's given a little bottle massage , a little bottle medal .
and say , " what would you like to do next ? "
the little bottle says , " i just don 't know . "
but that 's not actually what happens .
that bottle winds up getting burned .
recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which releases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kills people .
and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like " cancer alley , " poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately , and then poor people , who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened , are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .
now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say , " that sure is terrible for those poor people .
it 's just awful , those poor people .
i hope someone does something to help them . "
but what we don 't understand is -- is , here we are in los angeles .
we worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in los angeles .
but guess what ?
because they 're doing so much dirty production in asia now , because the environmental laws don 't protect the people in asia now , almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we 've achieved here in california have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from asia .
so , we all are being hit . we all are being impacted .
it 's just the poor people get hit first and worst .
but the dirty production , the burning of toxins , the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it 's coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in california .
we 're back where we were in the 1970s .
and so we 're on one planet , and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems .
well the root of this problem , in my view , is the idea of disposability itself .
you see , if you understand the link between what we 're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we 're doing to poor people , you arrive at a very troubling , but also very helpful , insight : in order to trash the planet , you have to trash people .
but if you create a world where you don 't trash people , you can 't trash the planet .
so now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea , we finally can now see that they are really , at the end of the day , one idea .
and it 's the idea that we don 't have disposable anything .
we don 't have disposable resources .
we don 't have disposable species .
and we don 't have disposable people either .
we don 't have a throwaway planet , and we don 't have throwaway children -- it 's all precious .
and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding , new opportunities for action begin to emerge .
biomimicry , which is something that is an emerging science , winds up being a very important social justice idea .
people who are just learning about this stuff , biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species .
democracy , by the way , means respecting the wisdom of all people -- and we 'll get to that .
but biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species .
it turns out we 're a pretty clever species .
this big cortex , or whatever , we 're pretty proud of ourselves .
but if we want to make something hard , we come up , " i know , i 'm going to make a hard substance .
i know , i 'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute , but i got this hard thing .
i 'm so clever , "
and you look behind you , and there 's destruction all around you .
but guess what ? you 're so clever , but you 're not as clever as a clam .
a clamshell 's hard .
there 's no vacuums . there 's no big furnaces . there 's no poison . there 's no pollution .
it turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well .
well that insight of biomimicry , of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species . i don 't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff .
i don 't mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species . i mean actually respecting them , respecting what they 've achieved .
that 's called biomimicry , and that opens the door to zero waste production , zero pollution production -- that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life , a high standard of living without trashing the planet .
well that idea of biomimicry , respecting the wisdom of all species , combined with the idea of democracy and social justice , respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people , would give us a different society .
we would have a different economy .
we would have a green society that dr. king would be proud of .
that should be the goal .
and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we 've talked about , but it even corrupts our own society .
we 're so proud to live here in california .
we just had this vote , and everybody 's like , " well , not in our state .
i don 't know what those other states were doing . "
just so proud .
and , yeah , i 'm proud , too .
but california , though we lead the world in some of the green stuff , we also , unfortunately , lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .
california has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states .
we have a moral challenge in this moment .
we are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill , but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings , living people .
and i would say that we live in a country -- five percent of the world 's population , 25 percent of the greenhouse gases , but also 25 percent of the world 's prisoners .
one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the united states .
so that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in .
and yet , as a movement that has to broaden its constituency , that has to grow , that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone , one of the challenges to the success of this movement , of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift , is people look at our movement with some suspicion .
and they ask a question , and the question is : how can these people be so passionate ?
a poor person , a low-income person , somebody in " cancer alley , " somebody in watts , somebody in harlem , somebody on an indian reservation , might say to themselves , and rightfully so , " how can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life , or an aluminum can has a second chance , and yet , when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison , he doesn 't get a second chance ? "
how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don 't have throwaway stuff , no throwaway dead materials , and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like " cancer alley ? "
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
when we take on topics like this , it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow ,
and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we 've been in .
most of you are good , softhearted people .
when you were younger , you cared about the whole world , and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue , you had to boil your love down to an issue .
can 't love the whole world -- you 've got to work on trees , or you 've got to work on immigration .
you 've got to shrink it down and be about one issue .
and really , they fundamentally told you , " are you going to hug a tree , or are you going to hug a child ? pick .
are you going to hug a tree , or are you going to hug a child ? pick . "
well , when you start working on issues like plastic , you realize that the whole thing is connected , and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms .
we can hug both .
thank you very much .

paul moller on the skycar
many of you could ask the question , you know , why is a flying car , or maybe more accurately , a roadable aircraft , possible at this time ?
a number of years ago , mr. ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available .
now , 60 years later , i 'm here to tell you why it 's possible .
when i was about five years old , not very much -- about a year after mr. ford made his predictions , i was living in a rural part of canada , on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area .
getting to school , for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age , through the canadian winter , was not a pleasant experience .
it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through .
at the end of my first year in school , in the summer of that year , i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home .
they 'd worn themselves out , beating themselves against the window , and , well , they were easy to capture . i took them outside and as i let them go , that split second , even though they were very tired , that second i let them go they hovered for a second , then zipped off into the distance .
i thought , what a great way to get to school .
for a kid at that age , this was like infinite speed , disappearing , and i was very inspired by that .
and so the next -- over the next six decades , believe it or not , i 've built a number of aircraft , with the goal of creating something that could do for you , or me , what the hummingbird does , and give you that flexibility .
i 've called this vehicle , generically , a volantor , after the latin word " volant , " meaning , to fly in a light , nimble manner .
volantor-like helicopter , perhaps .
the faa , the controlling body above all , calls it a " powered lift aircraft . "
and they 've actually issued a pilot 's license -- a powerlift pilot 's license -- for this type of aircraft .
it 's closer than you think . it 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft .
so for once , perhaps , the government is ahead of itself .
the press calls my particular volantor a " skycar . "
this is a little bit earlier version of it , that 's why it 's given the x designation , but it 's a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically , like a helicopter -- therefore it doesn 't need an airfield .
on the ground , it 's powered electrically .
it 's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels , which is a great asset because it allows you , theoretically , to use this on the highways in most states , and actually in all cities .
so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it -- you 're never going to fly it .
one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does , and gets around in much the same way , and it 's true , but a helicopter is a very complex device .
it 's expensive -- so expensive that very few people could own or use it .
it 's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity , as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation .
another difference , and i have to describe this , because it 's very personal , another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor -- in my case the skycar volantor -- is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those .
in a helicopter you feel -- and it 's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane .
when you get in the skycar -- and i can tell you , there 's only one other person that 's flown it , but he had the same sensation -- you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet , without any vibration whatsoever . the sensation is unbelievable .
and it 's been a great motivator .
i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally , and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so , but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time .
what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips .
very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in america .
if we can get rid of that , then the highways will now be useful to you , as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of the world today .
on this next slide , is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure , because whether i give you a perfect skycar , the perfect vehicle for use , it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in .
i 'm sure any of you have asked the question , yeah , are there great things up there -- what am i going to do , get up there ?
it 's bad enough on a highway , what 's it going to be like to be in the air ?
this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated . you 're not going to be a pilot , you 're going to be a passenger .
and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward .
i can tell you , technically we can build skycars -- my god , we went to the moon !
the technology there was much more difficult than what i 'm dealing with here .
but we have to have these priority changes , we have to have infrastructure to go with this .
historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals , and as that system disappeared , were replaced by railroads .
as that disappeared we came in with highways .
but if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today . highways are no longer being built , and that 's a fact . you won 't see any additional highways in the next 10 years .
however , the next 10 years , if like the last 10 years , we 're going to see 30 percent more traffic .
and where is that going to lead you to ?
so the issue then , i 've often asked , is when is it going to happen ?
when are we going to be able to have these vehicles ?
and of course , if you ask me , i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view .
after all , i 've been spending 60 years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow .
so , i 'm not going to quote myself on this .
i 'd prefer to quote someone else , who testified with me before congress , and in his position as head of nasa put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft .
now i would argue , actually , if you look at the fact that on the highways today , you 're only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average , according to the dot -- the skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour , up to 25,000 feet .
and so , in effect , you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned .
unbeknownst to many of you , the highway in the sky that i 'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years .
it makes use of the gps -- you 're familiar with gps in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there 's a gps u.s. , there 's a russian gps , and there 's a new gps system going to europe , called galileo .
with those three systems , you have what is always necessary -- a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you 'll still have a way to make sure that you 're being controlled .
because if you 're in this world , where computers are controlling what you 're doing , it 's going to be very critical that something can 't fail on you .
how would a trip in a skycar work ?
well , you can 't right now take off from your home because it 's too noisy .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you 'd have to be extremely quiet .
but it 's still fairly quiet .
you 'd motor , electrically , to a vertiport , which may be a few blocks , maybe even a few miles away .
this is clearly , as i said earlier , a roadable aircraft , and you 're not going to spend that much time on the road .
after all , if you can fly like that , why are you going to drive around on a highway ?
go to a local vertiport , plug in your destination , delivered almost like a passenger .
you can play computer games , you can sleep , you can read on the way .
this is the world -- there won 't be you as a pilot . and i know the pilots in the audience aren 't going to like that -- and i 've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experiencing that .
and of course , i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that .
but the vehicle itself is going to be a very , very controlled environment .
or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system .
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 , when i really got it started .
i was a professor at the u.c. davis system , and i got a lot of excitement around this , and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time .
and then through the various years we invented various vehicles .
actually the critical point was in 1989 , when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle -- how completely stable it was in all circumstances , which is of course very critical .
still not a practical vehicle during all of this , but moving in the right direction , we believe .
finally , in the early part of -- or actually the middle of 2002 , we flew the 400 -- m400 , which was the four-passenger vehicle .
in this case here , we 're flying it remotely , as we always did at the beginning .
and we had very small power plants in it at this time .
we are now installing larger powerplants , which will make it possible for me to get back on board .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program .
there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s , when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system -- that 's essential .
at least for the hover , and the low-speed flight .
if that single-stability system , that brain that flies that aircraft , fails , or if the engine fails , that vehicle crashes . there is no option to that .
and the adage that i 'm referring to , that applied at that time , was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down .
that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots .
in fact , the aircraft companies gave up on vertical-takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years .
and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter -- and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft , like the hummingbird , has a very high metabolism , which means it requires a lot of energy .
getting that energy is very , very difficult . it all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package .
fortunately , dr. felix wankel invented the rotary engine .
a very unique engine -- it 's round , it 's small , it 's vibration-free .
it fits exactly where we need to fit it , right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system -- very critical . in fact that engine -- for those who are into the automobile -- know that it recently is applied to the rx8 -- the mazda .
and that sportscar won sports car of the year .
wonderful engine .
in that application , it generates one horsepower per pound , which is twice as good as your car engine today , but only half of what we need .
my company has spent 35 years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine , which was invented in the late ' 50s , and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound , reliably , and critical .
we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot .
we have eight engines in this vehicle . we have four computers . we have two parachutes .
redundancy is the critical issue here .
if you want to stay alive you 've got to have backups .
and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine , and continued to hover .
the computers back up each other . there 's a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it 's kicked out of the system .
and then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
if you stick around , then good luck .
there won 't be a third chance .
the parachutes are there -- hopefully , more for psychological than real reasons , but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that .
i 'd like to show you an animation in this next one , which is one element of the skycar 's use , but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used .
you could think of it personally in your own terms , of how you might use it .
video : skycar dispatched , launch rescue vehicle for san francisco .
paul moller : i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar , probably in another volantor form as well , will be a significant part of our lives , as dr. goldin says , within the next 10 years .
and it 's going to change the demographics in a very significant way .
if you can live 75 miles from san francisco and get there in 15 minutes , you 're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment , buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain , buy a skycar , which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars , put money in the bank ...
that 's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco .
but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell .
developing the skycar has been a real challenge .
obviously i 'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what i 'm doing -- both financially and in technical help .
and that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing , and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing .
i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism , as it 's described , which really talks about what i 've experienced , and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies .
there 's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it 's msnbc -- in which they asked the question , " are you in the market for a volantor ? "
twenty-three percent said , " yes , as soon as possible . "
forty-seven percent -- yes , as soon as they could -- price could come down .
twenty-three percent said , " as soon as it 's proven safe . "
only seven percent said that they wouldn 't consider buying a skycar .
i 'm encouraged by that . at least it makes me feel like , to some extent , it is becoming self-evident .
that we need an alternative to the automobile , at least for those 50-mile trips and more , so that the highways become usable in today 's world .
thank you .

early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
the thought that you wouldn 't want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
they thought , " who would use it if you didn 't ? "
and so , in fact , he actually set about doing a variety of things .
built the tesla coil . this tower was built on long island back at the beginning of the 1900s .
and the idea was , it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on earth .
we 'll never know if this stuff worked . actually , i think the federal bureau of investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s .
but the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much .
if you just walk outside , there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world , putting up wires to get power from where it 's created to where it 's used .
the other thing is , we love batteries .
and for those of us that have an environmental element to us , there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year
for power that , generally speaking , is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power .
so , before i got here , i thought , " you know , i am from north america .
we do have a little bit of a reputation in the united states . "
so i thought i 'd better look it up first .
so definition number six is the north american definition of the word " suck . "
wires suck , they really do .
think about it . whether that 's you in that picture or something under your desk .
the other thing is , batteries suck too .
and they really , really do .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
40 billion of these things built .
this is what happens .
they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
so when you talk about expensive power , the cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds .
think about that .
the most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that .
so fortunately , one of the other definitions of " suck " that was in there , it does create a vacuum .
and nature really does abhor a vacuum .
what happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at mit actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance .
basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters .
it got about 50 percent of the efficiency --
by the way , that 's still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be , to do the same thing .
but were able to light that , and do it very successfully . this was actually the experiment . so you can see the coils were somewhat larger .
the light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint .
this all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife 's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power .
and he was thinking , " with all the electricity that 's out there in the walls , why couldn 't some of that just come into the phone so i could get some sleep ? "
and he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer .
but inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire . and those two coils of wire are really , really close to each other , and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly , only over a very short distance .
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
it 's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
so how does it work ?
imagine a coil . for those of you that are engineers , there 's a capacitor attached to it too .
and if you can cause that coil to resonate , what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency , by the way .
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequency , you can actually get them to do what 's called strongly couple , and transfer magnetic energy between them .
and then what you do is , you start out with electricity , turn it into magnetic field , take that magnetic field , turn it back into electricity , and then you can use it .
number one question i get asked . i mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
you know . what about safety ?
the first thing is this is not a " radiative " technology .
it doesn 't radiate .
there aren 't electric fields here . it 's a magnetic field .
it stays within either what we call the source , or within the device .
and actually , the magnetic fields we 're using are basically about the same as the earth 's magnetic field .
we live in a magnetic field .
and the other thing that 's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
and it 's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do .
they 've pretty much set field exposure limits , which all of the things in the stuff i 'll show you today mobile electronics .
home electronics .
those cords under your desk , i bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries .
there are industrial applications .
and then finally , electric vehicles .
these electric cars are beautiful .
but who is going to want to plug them in ?
imagine driving into your garage -- we 've built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage , and the car charges itself ,
because there is a mat on the floor that 's plugged into the wall .
and it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
then there 's all kinds of other applications . implanted medical devices ,
where people don 't have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
so what i 'd like to do is take a couple minutes and show you , actually , how it works .
and what i 'm going to do is to show you pretty much what 's here .
you 've got a coil . that coil is connected to an r.f. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field .
we put one on the back of the television set .
by the way , i do make it look a little bit easier than it is .
there 's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it .
but then what 's going to happen is , it will create a field . it will cause one to get created on the other side .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
the 10 seconds actually are because we --
i don 't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a t.v. in when you use just a cord .
generally , you have to go over and hit the button . so i thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that .
so , i 'll plug that in .
it creates a magnetic field here .
it causes one to be created out here .
and as i said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
this is a commercially -- available color television set .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
think about it . you don 't want those ugly cords coming down .
imagine if you can get rid of it .
the other thing i wanted to talk about was safety .
so , there is nothing going on . i 'm okay .
and i 'll do it again , just for safety 's sake .
almost immediately , though , people ask , " how small can you make this ? can you make this small enough ? "
because remember dr. soljacic 's original idea was his wife 's cellphone beeping .
so , i wanted to show you something .
we 're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
this a google g1 .
you know , it 's the latest thing that 's come out .
it runs the android operating system .
i think i heard somebody talk about that before .
it 's odd . it has a battery .
it also has coiled electronics that witricity has put into the back of it .
and if i can get the camera -- okay , great -- you 'll see , as i get sort of close ... you 're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
and i know some of you are apple aficionados .
so , you know they don 't make it easy at apple to get inside their phones .
so we put a little sleeve on the back ,
but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .
and those of you that have an iphone recognize the green center .
and nokia as well .
you 'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back , to do that , and it probably beeps , actually , as it goes on as well .
but they typically use it to light up the screen .
so , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
they could go in the floor . they could go , actually , underneath your desktop .
so that when you walk in or you come in from home , if you carry a purse , it works in your purse .
you never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
and think of what that would do for you .
so i think in closing , sort of in the immortal visions of the new yorker magazine , i thought i 'd put up one more slide .
and for those of you who can 't read it , it says , " it does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . "
so , thank you very much .

here 's a powerful provocation from artist jae rhim lee . can we commit our bodies to a cleaner , greener earth , even after death ? naturally -- using a special burial suit seeded with pollution-gobbling mushrooms . yes , this just might be the strangest tedtalk you 'll ever see ...

jae rhim lee : my mushroom burial suit
so i 'm here to explain why i 'm wearing these ninja pajamas .
and to do that , i 'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies .
so some of you may know about the chemical bisphenol a , bpa .
it 's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that 's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics .
so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems .
and it 's everywhere .
a recent study found bpa in 93 percent of people six and older .
but it 's just one chemical .
the center for disease control in the u.s. says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies , and this includes preservatives , pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury .
to me , this says three things .
first , don 't become a cannibal .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
and third , our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .
so what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
the short answer is : they return to the environment in one way or another , continuing the cycle of toxicity .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
if you 're cremated , all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .
and this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year .
and in a traditional american funeral , a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive .
it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
green or natural burials , which don 't use embalming , are a step in the right direction , but they don 't address the existing toxins in our bodies .
i think there 's a better solution .
i 'm an artist , so i 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
the infinity burial project , an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies .
the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies , clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots , leaving clean compost .
but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom .
i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil . so i thought maybe i could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body .
so today , i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off -- my hair , skin and nails -- and i 'm feeding these to edible mushrooms .
as the mushrooms grow , i pick the best feeders to become infinity mushrooms .
it 's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife .
so when i die , the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it .
all right , so for some of you , this may be really , really out there .
just a little .
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body , i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment .
see for me , cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet , it 's a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay .
it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet .
growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture , a concept that was developed by an entomologist , timothy myles .
the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies .
and now about these ninja pajamas .
once it 's completed , i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects .
first , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit .
i 'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
it 's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores .
the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
i 'm also making a decompiculture kit , a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation .
these capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly , a kind of second skin , which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms .
so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two , and then i 'd like to begin testing them , first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects .
and believe it or not , a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms .
what i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment .
i wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms , so i formed the decompiculture society , a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options , seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom .
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment , as the research on environmental toxins confirms .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
and once we understand that we 're connected to the environment , we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet .
i believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
thank you .

stephen lawler tours microsoft virtual earth
what i want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds , digital globes , the 3-d web , the metaverse .
what does this all mean for us ?
what it means is the web is going to become an exciting place again .
it 's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world . with graphics , computing power , low latencies , these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives .
so the virtual earth initiative , and other types of these initiatives , are all about extending our current search metaphor .
when you think about it , we 're so constrained by browsing the web , remembering urls , saving favorites .
as we move to search , we rely on the relevance rankings , the web matching , the index crawling . but we want to use our brain !
we want to navigate , explore , discover information .
in order to do that , we have to put you as a user back in the driver 's seat .
we need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer .
so what better way to put you back in the driver 's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day ?
why not leverage the learnings that you 've been learning your entire life ?
so virtual earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation , comprehensive , of the entire world .
what we want to do is mix in all types of data .
tag it . attribute it . metadata . get the community to add local depth , global perspective , local knowledge .
so when you think about this problem , what an enormous undertaking . where do you begin ?
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
this process is an engineering problem , a mechanical problem , a logistical problem , an operational problem .
here is an example of our aerial camera .
this is panchromatic . it 's actually four color cones .
in addition , it 's multi-spectral .
we collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
that 's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity .
we fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air . you can see the camera on the front . we collect multiple viewpoints , vantage points , angles , textures . we bring all that data back in .
we sit here -- you know , think about the ground vehicles , the human scale -- what do you see in person ? we need to capture that up close to establish that what it 's like-type experience .
i bet many of you have seen the apple commercials , kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity .
so a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy , he 's got the web cam ?
the poor pc guy . they 're duct taping his head . they 're just wrapping it on him .
well , a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team .
. so they 've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here .
but let me tell you -- it doesn 't affect his day job .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
this was after katrina . we were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone .
we flew the area . we imaged it . we sent in people . we took pictures of interiors , disaster areas . we helped with the first responders , the search and rescue .
often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on virtual earth .
we made it all freely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .
when we think about how all this comes together , it 's all about software , algorithms and math .
you know , we capture this imagery but to build the 3-d models we need to do geo-positioning . we need to do geo-registering of the images .
we have to bundle adjust them . find tie points .
extract geometry from the images .
this process is a very calculated process .
in fact , it was always done manual .
hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they 'd have to do it manually .
they 'd drive the streets with lasers called lidar .
they 'd collected information with photos . they 'd manually build each building .
we do this all through software , algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .
we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
we think about the user interface .
what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
an ortho-view , a nadir-view . how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model ?
i 'll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek i haven 't really shown into the lab area of virtual earth .
what we 're doing is -- people like this a lot , this bird 's eye imagery we work with . it 's this high resolution data .
but what we 've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model .
a child can navigate with an xbox controller or a game controller .
so here what we 're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-d model space .
you can see all types of resolution . from here , i can slowly pan the image over .
i can get the next image . i can blend and transition .
by doing this i don 't lose the original detail . in fact , i might be recording history .
the freshness , the capacity . i can turn this image .
i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
what we 're trying to do is build a virtual world .
we hope that we can make computing a user model you 're familiar with , and really derive insights from you , from all different directions .
i thank you very much for your time .

economist yasheng huang compares china to india , and asks how china 's authoritarian rule contributed to its astonishing economic growth -- leading to a big question : is democracy actually holding india back ? huang 's answer may surprise you .
culture , economics , global issues , politics

yasheng huang : does democracy stifle economic growth ?
my topic is economic growth in china and india .
and the question i want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth .
you may say this is not fair , because i 'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy .
actually , exactly the opposite is what i 'm going to do .
i 'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy , rather than against democracy .
the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india .
over the last 30 years , in terms of the gdp growth rates , china has grown at twice the rate of india .
in the last five years , the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth .
but over the last 30 years , china undoubtedly has done much better than india .
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai .
look at the skyline of shanghai .
this is the pudong area .
the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india .
the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law .
it can plan for the long-term benefits of the country and in the process , evict millions of people -- that 's just a small technical issue .
whereas in india , you cannot do that , because you have to listen to the public .
you 're being constrained by the public 's opinion .
even prime minister manmohan singh agrees with that view .
in an interview printed in the financial press of india , he said that he wants to make mumbai another shanghai .
this is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values , and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai .
so let me call it the shanghai model of economic growth , that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development : infrastructures , airports , highways , bridges , things like that .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
you cannot be constrained by the public 's opinion .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
the implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth , rather than a facilitator of economic growth .
here 's the key question . just how important are infrastructures for economic growth ?
this is a key issue .
if you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth , then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth .
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe , then you will put less emphasis on strong government .
so to illustrate that question , let me give you two countries .
and for the sake of brevity , i 'll call one country country 1 and the other country country 2 .
country 1 has a systematic advantage over country 2 in infrastructures .
country 1 has more telephones , and country 1 has a longer system of railways .
so if i were to ask you , " which is china and which is india , and which country has grown faster ? " if you believe in the infrastructure view , then you will say , " country 1 must be china .
they must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
and country 2 is possibly india . "
actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union , and the data referred to 1989 .
after the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones , the country collapsed .
that 's not too good .
the picture there is khrushchev .
i know that in 1989 he no longer ruled the soviet union , but that 's the best picture that i can find .
telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
country 2 , that has fewer telephones , is china .
since 1989 , the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years .
if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones , you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades .
country 1 , that has a longer system of railways , is actually india .
and country 2 is china .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
yes , today china has a huge infrastructure advantage over india .
but for many years , until the late 1990s , china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis india .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the railways , and the british built a lot of railways in india .
india is the smaller of the two countries , and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s .
so clearly , infrastructure doesn 't explain why china did better before the late 1990s , as compared with india .
in fact , if you look at the evidence worldwide , the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth . the economy grows , government accumulates more resources , and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .
and this is clearly the story of the chinese economic growth .
let me look at this question more directly .
is democracy bad for economic growth ?
now let 's turn to two countries , country a and country b .
country a , in 1990 , had about $ 300 per capita gdp as compared with country b , which had $ 460 in per capita gdp .
by 2008 , country a has surpassed country b with $ 700 per capita gdp as compared with $ 650 per capita gdp .
both countries are in asia .
if i were to ask you , " which are the two asian countries ?
and which one is a democracy ? " you may argue , " well , maybe country a is china and country b is india . "
in fact , country a is democratic india , and country b is pakistan -- the country that has a long period of military rule .
and it 's very common that we compare india with china .
that 's because the two countries have about the same population size .
but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan .
those two countries are geographically similar .
they have a complicated , but shared common history .
by that comparison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
so why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments ?
one reason is the east asian model .
in east asia , we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea , taiwan , hong kong and singapore .
some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the 60s and 70s and 1980s .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries , " have you won the lottery ? "
and they all tell you , " yes , we have won the lottery . "
and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are 100 percent .
the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn 't end up winning the prize .
for each of these successful authoritarian governments in east asia , there 's a matched failure .
korea succeeded , north korea didn 't .
taiwan succeeded , china under mao zedong didn 't .
burma didn 't succeed .
the philippines didn 't succeed .
if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide , there 's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth .
so the east asian model has this massive selection bias -- it is known as selecting on a dependent variable , something we always tell our students to avoid .
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
i will take you to the cultural revolution , when china went mad , and compare that country 's performance with india under indira gandhi .
the question there is : which country did better , china or india ?
china was during the cultural revolution .
it turns out even during the cultural revolution , china out-perfomed india in terms of gdp growth by an average of about 2.2 percent every year in terms of per capita gdp .
so that 's when china was mad . the whole country went mad .
it must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the cultural revolution .
the advantage the country had was human capital -- nothing else but human capital .
this is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s .
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
the adult literacy rate in china is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in india .
the contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between chinese women and indian women .
i haven 't told you about the definition of literacy .
in china , the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 chinese characters .
in india , the definition of literacy , operating definition of literacy , is the ability , the grand ability , to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak .
the gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated .
if you go to other sources of data such as human development index , that data series , go back to the early 1970s , you see exactly the same contrast .
china held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis india .
life expectancies : as early as 1965 , china had a huge advantage in life expectancy .
on average , as a chinese in 1965 , you lived 10 years more than an average indian .
so if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian , you would want to become a chinese in order to live 10 years longer .
if you made that decision in 1965 , the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution .
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
if you cannot chose your nationality , then you will want to become an indian man .
because , as an indian man , you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis-a-vis indian women .
this is an extremely strange fact .
it 's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern .
it shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the indian society against women .
the good news is , by 2006 , india has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy .
today , indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men .
so india is reverting to the normal .
but india still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality .
these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories in india .
in china , it 's all women .
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in china is women in the coastal part of the country , whereas in india , it 's all men .
financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title , " india poised to overtake china in textile . "
by looking at these two pictures , i say no , it won 't overtake china for a while .
if you look at other east asian countries , women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take-off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with east asia .
india still has a long way to go to catch up with china .
then the issue is , what about the chinese political system ?
you talk about human capital , you talk about education and public health .
what about the political system ?
isn 't it true that the one-party political system has facilitated economic growth in china ?
actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
it depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system .
statically , china is a one-party system , authoritarian -- there 's no question about it .
dynamically , it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic .
when you explain change -- for example , economic growth ; economic growth is about change -- when you explain change , you use other things that have changed to explain change , rather than using the constant to explain change .
sometimes a fixed effect can explain change , but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
they have increased the security of proprietors .
and they have increased the security with long-term land leases .
there are also financial reforms in rural china .
there is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in china .
to me , the pace of political changes is too slow , too gradual .
and my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges , because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms .
but nevertheless , the system has moved in a more liberal direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
you can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on india .
in fact , when india was growing at a hindu rate of growth -- about one percent , two percent a year -- that was when india was least democratic .
indira gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .
the indian government owned and operated all the tv stations .
a little-known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms , the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self-rule , privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts .
so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction .
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
one reason is they are always comparing india with china .
but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth .
if you are a nba player and you are always being compared to michael jordan , you 're going to look not so impressive .
but that doesn 't mean that you 're a bad basketball player .
comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
in fact , if you compare india with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth -- now india is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies .
this is a very impressive record indeed .
let 's think about the future : the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant .
which country has the growth momentum ?
china , i believe , still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital , the public health , the sense of egalitarianism that you don 't find in india .
but i believe that india has the momentum .
it has the improving fundamentals . the government has invested in basic education , has invested in basic health .
i believe the government should do more , but nevertheless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
i believe that the political reforms are a must for china to maintain its growth .
and it 's very important to have political reforms , to have widely shared benefits of economic growth .
i don 't know whether that 's going to happen or not , but i 'm an optimist .
hopefully , five years from now , i 'm going to report to tedglobal that political reforms will happen in china .
thank you very much .

steven johnson : where good ideas come from
just a few minutes ago , i took this picture about 10 blocks from here .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
i took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in england in 1650 .
that 's its great claim to fame ,
and i wanted to show it to you , not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england , but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years , what we now call the enlightenment .
and the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the enlightenment , in part , because of what people were drinking there .
because , before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture , what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank -- day-in and day-out , from dawn until dusk was alcohol .
alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin -- particularly around 1650 -- and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
that was the healthy choice -- right -- because the water wasn 't safe to drink .
and so , effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse , you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day .
and you can imagine what that would be like , right , in your own life -- and i know this is true of some of you -- if you were drinking all day , and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas .
you would be sharper and more alert .
and so it 's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee .
but the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space .
it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds , different fields of expertise , and share .
it was a space , as matt ridley talked about , where ideas could have sex .
this was their conjugal bed , in a sense --
ideas would get together there .
and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story .
i 've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years , because i 've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from .
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation , unusual levels of creativity ?
what 's the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity ?
and what i 've done is i 've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse ; i 've looked at media environments , like the world wide web , that have been extraordinarily innovative ; i 've gone back to the history of the first cities ; i 've even gone to biological environments , like coral reefs and rainforests , that involve unusual levels of biological innovation ; and what i 've been looking for is shared patterns , kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments .
are there recurring patterns that we can learn from , that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives , or our own organizations , or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative ?
and i think i 've found a few .
but what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea-creation .
we have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
we have the kind of the flash of insight , the stroke of insight , we have epiphanies , we have " eureka ! " moments , we have the lightbulb moments , right ?
all of these concepts , as kind of rhetorically florid as they are , share this basic assumption , which is that an idea is a single thing , it 's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment .
but in fact , what i would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level .
i mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
an idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain .
it 's a new configuration that has never formed before .
and the question is : how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form ?
and it turns out that , in fact , the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain .
so the metaphor i 'd like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that 's quite recent -- a lot more recent than the 1650s .
a wonderful guy named timothy prestero , who has a company called ... an organization called design that matters .
they decided to tackle this really pressing problem of , you know , the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world .
one of the things that 's very frustrating about this is that we know , by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context , if we can keep premature babies warm , basically -- it 's very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments .
so , the technology is there .
these are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
the problem is , if you buy a $ 40,000 incubator , and you send it off to a mid-sized village in africa , it will work great for a year or two years , and then something will go wrong and it will break , and it will remain broken forever , because you don 't have a whole system of spare parts , and you don 't have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $ 40,000 piece of equipment .
and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being useless .
so what prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see : what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts ?
and what they noticed was they don 't have a lot of dvrs , they don 't have a lot of microwaves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
there 's a toyota forerunner on the street in all these places .
they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
so they started to think , " could we build a neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts ? "
and this is what they ended up coming with .
it 's called a " neonurture device . "
from the outside , it looks like a normal little thing you 'd find in a modern , western hospital .
in the inside , it 's all car parts .
it 's got a fan , it 's got headlights for warmth , it 's got door chimes for alarm --
it runs off a car battery .
and so all you need is the spare parts from your toyota and the ability to fix a headlight , and you can repair this thing .
now , that 's a great idea , but what i 'd like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen .
we like to think our breakthrough ideas , you know , are like that $ 40,000 , brand new incubator , state-of-the-art technology , but more often than not , they 're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby .
we take ideas from other people , from people we 've learned from , from people we run into in the coffee shop , and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new .
that 's really where innovation happens .
and that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like , right .
i mean , this is one vision of it .
another is newton and the apple , when newton was at cambridge .
this is a statue from oxford .
you know , you 're sitting there thinking a deep thought , and the apple falls from the tree , and you have the theory of gravity .
in fact , the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this , right .
this is hogarth 's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern , but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds .
so , if we 're trying to build organizations that are more innovative , we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable , when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas , or their history of their best ideas .
and a few years ago , a wonderful researcher named kevin dunbar decided to go around and basically do the big brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from .
he went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job .
so when they were sitting in front of the microscope , when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler , and all these things .
and he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas , where they happened .
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab , we have this image -- you know , they 're pouring over the microscope , and they see something in the tissue sample .
and " oh , eureka , " they 've got the idea .
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that , in fact , almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab , in front of the microscope .
they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting , when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings , oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having , the error , the noise in the signal they were discovering .
and something about that environment -- and i 've started calling it the " liquid network , " where you have lots of different ideas that are together , different backgrounds , different interests , jostling with each other , bouncing off each other -- that environment is , in fact , the environment that leads to innovation .
the other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames .
so they want to tell the story of the " eureka ! " moment .
they want to say , " there i was , i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head . " but in fact , if you go back and look at the historical record , it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods --
i call this the " slow hunch . "
we 've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink-like sudden moments of clarity , but in fact , a lot of great ideas linger on , sometimes for decades , in the back of people 's minds .
they have a feeling that there 's an interesting problem , but they don 't quite have the tools yet to discover them .
they spend all this time working on certain problems , but there 's another thing lingering there that they 're interested in , but they can 't quite solve .
darwin is a great example of this .
darwin himself , in his autobiography , tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic " eureka ! " moment .
he 's in his study , it 's october of 1838 , and he 's reading malthus , actually , on population .
and all of a sudden , the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says , " ah , at last , i had a theory with which to work . "
that 's in his autobiography .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful scholar named howard gruber went back and looked at darwin 's notebooks from this period .
and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hunch .
and what gruber found was that darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany , reading malthus in october of 1838 .
there are passages where you can read it , and you think you 're reading from a darwin textbook , from the period before he has this epiphany .
and so what you realize is that darwin , in a sense , had the idea , he had the concept , but was unable of fully thinking it yet .
and that is actually how great ideas often happen ; they fade into view over long periods of time .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
it 's hard to go to your boss and say , " i have an excellent idea for our organization .
it will be useful in 2020 .
could you just give me some time to do that ? " now a couple of companies -- like google -- they have innovation time off , 20 percent time , where , in a sense , those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization .
but that 's a key thing .
and the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people 's hunches ; that 's what often happens .
you have half of an idea , somebody else has the other half , and if you 're in the right environment , they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts .
so , in a sense , we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property , you know , building barricades , having secretive r & d labs , patenting everything that we have , so that those ideas will remain valuable , and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas , and the culture will be more innovative .
but i think there 's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time , if not more , valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them .
and i 'll leave you with this story , which i think captures a lot of these values , and it 's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways .
it 's october of 1957 , and sputnik has just launched , and we 're in laurel maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university .
and it 's monday morning , and the news has just broken about this satellite that 's now orbiting the planet .
and of course , this is nerd heaven , right ?
there are all these physics geeks who are there thinking , " oh my gosh ! this is incredible . i can 't believe this has happened . "
and two of them , two 20-something researchers at the apl are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues .
and these two guys are named guier and weiffenbach .
and they start talking , and one of them says , " hey , has anybody tried to listen for this thing ?
there 's this , you know , man-made satellite up there in outer space that 's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal .
we could probably hear it , if we tune in . " and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody 's like , " no , i hadn 't thought of doing that .
that 's an interesting idea . " and it turns out weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception , and he 's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office .
and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's office , and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking , as we might call it now .
and after a couple of hours , they actually start picking up the signal , because the soviets made sputnik very easy to track .
it was right at 20 mhz , so you could pick it up really easily , because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax , basically .
so they made it really easy to find it .
so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal , and people start kind of coming into the office and saying , " wow , that 's pretty cool . can i hear ? wow , that 's great . "
and before long , they think , " well jeez , this is kind of historic .
we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this .
we should record it . " and so they bring in this big , clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep , bleeps .
and they start writing the kind of date stamp , time stamps for each little bleep that they record .
and they they start thinking , " well gosh , you know , we 're noticing small little frequency variations here .
we could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling , if we do a little basic math here using the doppler effect . "
and then they played around with it a little bit more , and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties .
and they said , " jeez , you know , we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it 's farthest away .
that 's pretty cool . " and eventually , they get permission -- this is all a little side project that hadn 't been officially part of their job description .
they get permission to use the new , you know , univac computer that takes up an entire room that they 'd just gotten at the apl .
they run some more of the numbers , and at the end of about three or four weeks , turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the earth , just from listening to this one little signal , going off on this little side hunch that they 'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning .
a couple weeks later their boss , frank mcclure , pulls them into the room and says , " hey , you guys , i have to ask you something about that project you were working on .
you 've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground .
could you go the other way ?
could you figure out an unknown location on the ground , if you knew the location of the satellite ? " and they thought about it and they said , " well , i guess maybe you could . let 's run the numbers here . "
so they went back , and they thought about it .
and they came back and said , " actually , it 'll be easier . "
and he said , " oh , that 's great .
because see , i have these new nuclear submarines that i 'm building .
and it 's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow , if you don 't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean .
so we 're thinking , we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean .
could you work on that problem ? " and that 's how gps was born .
30 years later , ronald reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform , left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it .
and now , i guarantee you certainly half of this room , if not more , has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space .
and i bet you one of you , if not more , has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week , right ?
and that , i think , is a great case study , a great lesson in the power , the marvelous , kind of unplanned emergent , unpredictable power of open innovative systems .
when you build them right , they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of .
i mean , here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch , this little passion that had developed , then they thought they were fighting the cold war , and then it turns out they 're just helping somebody find a soy latte .
that is how innovation happens .
chance favors the connected mind .
thank you very much .

eva vertes looks to the future of medicine
thank you . it 's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager .
today i want to talk to you about the future , but first i 'm going to tell you a bit about the past .
my story starts way before i was born .
my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz , the death camp .
and she was going along the tracks , and the tracks split .
and somehow -- we don 't really know exactly the whole story -- but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp .
my grandmother survived and married my grandfather .
they were living in hungary , and my mother was born .
and when my mother was two years old , the hungarian revolution was raging , and they decided to escape hungary .
they got on a boat , and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to canada or to australia .
they got on and didn 't know where they were going , and ended up in canada .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
my grandmother was a chemist . she worked at the banting institute in toronto , and at 44 she died of stomach cancer . i never met my grandmother , but i carry on her name -- her exact name , eva vertes -- and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion , too .
i found this passion not far from here , actually , when i was nine years old .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon .
and i had never been a reader when i was young -- my dad had tried me with the hardy boys ; i tried nancy drew ; i tried all that -- and i just didn 't like reading books .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called " the hot zone . " it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus .
and something about it just kind of drew me towards it .
there was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover , and i just wanted to read it . i picked up that book , and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur , and to , actually , here where we are today , in monterey , i read that book , and from when i was reading that book , i knew that i wanted to have a life in medicine .
i wanted to be like the explorers i 'd read about in the book , who went into the jungles of africa , went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was . so from that moment on , i read every medical book i could get my hands on , and i just loved it so much .
i was a passive observer of the medical world .
it wasn 't until i entered high school that i thought , " maybe now , you know -- being a big high school kid -- i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . "
i was 14 , and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab . and hardly anyone responded .
but i mean , why would they respond to a 14-year-old , anyway ?
and i got to go talk to one professor , dr. jacobs , who accepted me into the lab .
at that time , i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology -- specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system .
so i started that , and worked in his lab for a year , and found the results that i guess you 'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really , really impaired the nervous system .
the spinal cord had breaks . the neurons were crossing in every which way .
and from then i wanted to look not at impairment , but at prevention of impairment .
so that 's what led me to alzheimer 's . i started reading about alzheimer 's and tried to familiarize myself with the research , and at the same time when i was in the -- i was reading in the medical library one day , and i read this article about something called " purine derivatives . "
and they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties .
and being naive about the whole field , i kind of thought , " oh , you have cell death in alzheimer 's which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth . "
and so i thought , " maybe if it can promote cell growth , it can inhibit cell death , too . "
and so that 's the project that i pursued for that year , and it 's continuing now as well , and found that a specific purine derivative called " guanidine " had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .
so i presented those results at the international science fair , which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life .
and there i was awarded " best in the world in medicine , " which allowed me to get in , or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world .
and from then on , since i was now in this huge exciting world , i wanted to explore it all . i wanted it all at once , but knew i couldn 't really get that .
and i stumbled across something called " cancer stem cells . "
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
at first when i heard of cancer stem cells , i didn 't really know how to put the two together . i 'd heard of stem cells , and i 'd heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future , perhaps .
but i 'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
last summer i worked at stanford university , doing some research on cancer stem cells .
and while i was doing this , i was reading the cancer literature , trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .
and it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell .
this fascinated me . the more i read , the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it .
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
if you smoke , you damage your lung tissue , and then lung cancer arises .
if you drink , you damage your liver , and then liver cancer occurs .
and it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture , and then bone cancer arises .
because what stem cells are -- they 're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue .
so , if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it 's initiating cancer , it 's almost as if this is a repair response .
and the cancer , the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged , we need to repair the lung . and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue .
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response , but can 't quite control it .
it hasn 't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated .
so this really , really fascinated me .
and i really think that we can 't think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms .
if we eliminate cancer the way we 're trying to do now , with chemotherapy and radiation , we 're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins , or with radiation , trying to kill it . it 's almost as if we 're getting back to this starting point .
we 're removing the cancer cells , but we 're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
shouldn 't we think about manipulation , rather than elimination ?
if somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue , lung tissue , liver tissue , whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process . we 'd end up better than we were before cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
and while i was reading all these articles about cancer , it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on , you know , the genetics of breast cancer , and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body , tracing where it is , where it goes .
but it struck me that i 'd never heard of cancer of the heart , or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter .
and skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body , or over 50 percent of our body . and so at first i kind of thought , " well , maybe there 's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn 't get cancer -- at least not that i know of . "
so , i looked further into it , found as many articles as i could , and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare .
some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer , and furthermore , not only to cancer , but of metastases going to skeletal muscle .
and what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ . that 's what a metastasis is .
it 's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
if cancer was localized , we could likely remove it , or somehow -- you know , it 's contained . it 's very contained .
but once it starts moving throughout the body , that 's when it becomes deadly .
so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles , but cancer didn 't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here .
so these articles were saying , you know , " skeletal -- metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare . "
but it was left at that . no one seemed to be asking why .
so i decided to ask why . at first -- the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology , and pretty much said , " hey , it seems like cancer doesn 't really go to skeletal muscle . is there a reason for this ? " and a lot of the replies i got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue .
meaning that you have muscle cells , but they 're not dividing , so it doesn 't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack .
but then again , this fact that the metastases didn 't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .
and furthermore , that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer , and brain cells are also terminally differentiated .
so i decided to ask why . and here 's some of , i guess , my hypotheses that i 'll be starting to investigate this may at the sylvester cancer institute in miami .
and i guess i 'll keep investigating until i get the answers .
but i know that in science , once you get the answers , inevitably you 're going to have more questions .
so i guess you could say that i 'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life .
some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there 's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle .
and the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
and you think , the more highways there are in a tissue , the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases .
so first of all i thought , you know , " wouldn 't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle ? " and as well , cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis , which is really , the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow .
without angiogenesis , the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it 's not harmful .
so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer .
and one article that really stood out to me when i was just reading about this , trying to figure out why cancer doesn 't go to skeletal muscle , was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
we use skeletal muscles so much . it 's the one portion of our body -- our heart 's always beating . we 're always moving our muscles .
is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ? it needs to be constantly contracting , so therefore it 's almost selfish . it 's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .
therefore , when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue , it can 't get a blood supply , and can 't grow .
so this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more , an angiogenic routing factor , so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --
this could be a potential future therapy for cancer .
and another thing that 's really interesting is that there 's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body , it 's a very complex system -- and there 's something called the chemokine network .
and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants , and they 're the stop and go signals for cancer .
so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors , and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines , and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it .
is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn 't express this type of molecules ?
and the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle -- there 's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured , that 's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle .
and , furthermore , when skeletal muscle is injured , that 's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying , " cancer , you can come to me , " the " go signs " for the tumors -- it causes them to highly express these chemokines .
so , there 's so much interplay here .
i mean , there are so many possibilities for why tumors don 't go to skeletal muscle .
but it seems like by investigating , by attacking cancer , by searching where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there 's got to be something -- that 's making this tissue resistant to tumors .
and can we utilize -- can we take this property , this compound , this receptor , whatever it is that 's controlling these anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general ?
now , one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called " myod . "
and what myod essentially does is , it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells . so this compound , myod , has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue , myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells ?
maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells , and this is why it seems as if it is so rare .
it 's not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged .
if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way , cancer occurred -- i mean , everybody would have cancer almost .
and i hate to say that . but it seems as though muscle cell , possibly because of all its use , has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury , to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish . i really believe that the human body is very , very smart , and we can 't counteract something the body is saying to do .
it 's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that 's a foreign object -- we want that out .
but when the body is actually initiating a process and we 're calling it a disease , it doesn 't seem as though elimination is the right solution . so even to go from there , it 's possible , although far-fetched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy .
if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example alzheimer 's , where the brain , the brain cells , die and we need to restore new brain cells , new functional brain cells -- what if we could , in the future , use cancer ? a tumor -- put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells ?
that 's a very far-fetched idea , but i really believe that it may be possible .
these cells are so versatile , these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way .
and again , some of these may be far-fetched , but i figured if there 's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas , it 's here at ted , so thank you very much .

rick smolan tells the story of a girl
some of you have heard the story before , but , in fact , there 's somebody in the audience who 's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before , so i 'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story .
i used to be a photographer for many years .
in 1978 , i was working for time magazine , and i was given a three-day assignment to photograph amerasian children , children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia , and then abandoned --
40,000 children all over asia .
i had never heard the word amerasian before .
i spent a few days photographing children in different countries , and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists , i always hope that when my pictures were published , they might actually have an effect on a situation , instead of just documenting it .
so , i was so disturbed by what i saw , and i was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards , that i decided i would take six months off .
i was 28 years old .
i decided i would find six children in different countries , and actually go spend some time with the kids , and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine .
in the course of doing the story , i was looking for children who hadn 't been photographed before , and the pearl buck foundation told me that they worked with a lot of americans who were donating money to help some of these kids .
and a man told me , who ran the pearl buck foundation in korea , that there was a young girl , who was 11 years old , being raised by her grandmother .
and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her .
every time any westerners came to the village , she hid the girl .
and of course , i was immediately intrigued .
i saw photographs of her , and i thought i wanted to go .
and the guy just told me , " there 's no way . this grandmother won 't even -- you know , there 's no way she 's ever going to let you meet this girl that 's she 's raising . " i took a translator with me , and went to this village , found the grandmother , sat down with her .
and to my astonishment , she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter .
and i was paying for this myself , so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week .
i had a sleeping bag .
the family had a small shed on the side of the house , so i said , " could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings ? "
and i just told the little girl , whose name was hyun-sook lee , that if i ever did anything to embarrass her -- she didn 't speak a word of english , although she looked very american -- she could just put up her hand and say , " stop , "
and i would stop taking pictures .
and then , my translator left .
so there i was , i couldn 't speak a word of korean , and this is the first night i met hyun-sook .
her mother was still alive .
her mother was not raising her , her grandmother was raising her .
and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were .
the grandmother was incredibly fond , deeply in love with this little girl .
they slept on the floor at night .
the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors , so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor .
hyun-sook was 11 years old .
i had photographed , as i said , a lot of these kids .
hyun-sook was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph .
and almost universally , amongst all the kids , they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of , ridiculed , picked on and been rejected .
and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids .
and what struck me immediately in meeting hyun-sook was how confident she appeared to be , how happy she seemed to be in her own skin .
and remember this picture , because i 'm going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
i decided to follow her to school .
this is the first morning i stayed with her .
this is on the way to school .
this is the morning assembly outside her school .
and i noticed that she was clowning around .
when the teachers would ask questions , she 'd be the first person to raise her hand .
again , not at all shy or withdrawn , or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed .
again , the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions .
getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend 's ears in the middle of class .
and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator -- again , this thing about saying stop -- was to not pay attention to me .
and so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
i noticed that at recess , she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team .
it was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
this is on the way home .
and that 's north korea up along the hill .
this is up along the dmz .
they would actually cover the windows every night , so that light couldn 't be seen , because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time .
so there 's always this -- the closer you were to north korea , the more terrifying it was .
very often at school , i 'd be taking pictures , and she would whisper into her girlfriends ' ears , and then look at me and say , " stop . "
and i would stand at attention , and all the girls would crack up , and it was sort of a little joke .
the end of the week came and my translator came back , because i 'd asked her to come back , so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun-sook .
and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator , the grandmother started crying .
and i said to my translator , " what 's going on , why is she crying ? "
and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment , and then she started getting tears in her eyes .
and i said , " ok , what did i do ? what 's going on ? why is everyone crying ? " and the translator said , " the grandmother says that she thinks she 's dying , and she wants to know if you would take hyun-sook to america with you . "
and i said , " i 'm 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i 'm not married . " i mean i had fallen in love with this girl , but i -- you know , it was , like , emotionally i was about 12 years old .
if you know of photographers , the joke is it 's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented . " sorry , i have to go on an assignment , i 'll be back " --
and then you never come back .
so , i asked the translator why she thought she was dying .
can i get her to a hospital ? could i pay to get her a doctor ?
and she refused any help at all .
and so , when i got outside , i actually gave the translator some money and said , " please go back and see if you can do something . " and i gave the grandmother my business card .
and i said , " if you 're serious , i will try to find a family for her . "
and i immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had an 11-year-old son .
and my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child .
so here my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year ,
and suddenly i was calling , saying " i 'm in korea , and i 've met this extraordinary girl . " and i said , " the grandmother thinks she 's sick , but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also . " and i said , " i 'll pay for the ... " i mean , i had this whole sort of picture .
so anyway , i left .
and my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her .
and i said , " look , i think i 'll scare the grandmother to death , if i actually write to her and tell her that you 're willing to adopt her , i want to go back and talk to her . " but i was off on assignment .
i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother .
and on christmas day , i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram -- back in those days , you got telegrams -- from time magazine saying someone in korea had died , and left their child in a will to me .
did i know anything about this ?
because i hadn 't told them what i was doing , because i was so upset with the story they 'd run .
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hyun-sook 's village , and she was gone .
and the house that i had spent time in was empty .
it was incredibly cold .
no one in the village would tell me where hyun-sook was , because the grandmother had always hidden her from westerners .
and they had no idea about this request that she 'd made of me .
so i finally found myung sung , her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .
and myung sung , under some pressure from me and the translator , gave us an address on the outside of seoul .
and i went to that address and knocked on the door , and a man answered the door .
it was not a very nice area of seoul , as there were mud streets outside of it .
and i knocked on the door , and hyun-sook answered the door , and her eyes were bloodshot , and she seemed to be in shock . she didn 't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever .
and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean .
and i said to the translator , " what did he say ? "
and she said , " he wants to know who you are . "
and i said , " well , tell him that i am a photographer . "
i started explaining who i was , and he interrupted .
and she said , " he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? "
i said , " well , tell him that i was asked by this little girl 's grandmother to find a family for her . " and he said , " i 'm her uncle , she 's fine , you can leave now . "
so i was -- you know , the door was being slammed in my face ,
it 's incredibly cold , and i 'm trying to think , " what would the hero do in a movie , if i was writing this as a movie script ? " so i said , " listen , it 's really cold , i 've come a very long way , do you mind if i just come in for a minute ? i 'm freezing . " so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor .
and as we started talking , i saw him yell something , and hyun-sook came and brought us some food .
and i had this whole mental picture of , sort of like cinderella .
i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful , bright , happy little child , who now appeared to be very withdrawn , being enslaved by this family .
and i was really appalled , and i couldn 't figure out what to do .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friendly he was getting .
so i finally decided , i said " look , " -- this is all through the translator , because , this is all , you know , i don 't speak a word of korean -- and i said , " look , i 'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with .
i was very worried about her .
i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her . " i said , " but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i 'm stuck here for a week . " and i said , " i 'm staying in a hotel downtown .
would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow ?
and you can practice your english . " because he told me -- i was trying to ask him questions about himself .
and so i went to the hotel , and i found two older amerasians .
a girl whose mother had been a prostitute , and she was a prostitute , and a boy who 'd been in and out of jail .
and i said to them , " look , there 's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america . " i said , " i don 't know if it 's the right decision or not , but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it 's like to walk down the street , what people say to you , what you do for a living .
and just -- i want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
and i could be wrong , i don 't know , but i wish you would come tomorrow . " so , these two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
they were yelling at him , they were -- it got to be really ugly .
and we went outside , and he was just furious .
and i knew i had totally blown this whole thing .
here i was again , trying to figure out what to do .
and he started yelling at me , and i said to the translator , " ok , tell him to calm down , what is he saying ? "
and she said , " well , he 's saying , ' who the hell are you to walk into my house , some rich american with your cameras around your neck , accusing me of enslaving my niece ?
this is my niece , i love her , she 's my sister 's daughter .
who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this ? ' " and i said , you know , " look , " i said , " you 're absolutely right .
i don 't pretend to understand what 's going on here . " i said , " all i know is , i 've been photographing a lot of these children . "
i said , " i 'm in love with your niece , i think she 's an incredibly special child . " and i said , " look , i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them , to see if you approve of them .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . " so , everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was , again , the stupidest thing i could have possibly done , because who 's ever good enough for your relative ?
but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother .
and they actually take items of clothing and photographs , and they burn them as part of the ritual .
and you can see how different she looks just in three months .
this was now , i think , february , early february .
and the pictures before were taken in september .
well , there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story , who had 75 children living in his house .
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
and so i suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet father keene , to find out how the adoption process worked .
because i wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board .
so , this is on the way down to the orphanage .
this is father keene . he 's just a wonderful guy .
he had kids from all over korea living there , and he would find families for these kids .
this is a social worker interviewing hyun-sook .
now , i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this , because the grandmother , to me , appeared to be sort of the village wise woman , and the person everybody -- throughout the day , i noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother .
and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village , they were one of the most respected families in the village .
and i always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded , and insisted , that the villagers treat hyun-sook with the same respect they treated her .
hyun-sook stayed at father keene 's , and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .
he actually agreed to the adoption .
and i went off on assignment and came back a week later , and father keene said , " i 've got to talk to you about hyun-sook . "
i kind of said , " oh god , now what ? "
and he takes me into this room , and he closes the door , and he says , " i have 75 children here in the orphanage , and it 's total bedlam . "
and there 's clothes , and there 's kids , and , you know , there 's three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine . and he said , " the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids .
and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids .
and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day . " and he said , " she 's telling me that i 'm messy , and i have to clean up my room . "
and he said , " i don 't know who raised her , but , " he said , " she 's running the orphanage , and she 's been here three days . " this was movie day -- that she organized -- where all the kids went to the movies .
a lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids , telling them about what their life was like with their new families .
so , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter .
they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun-sook into their family .
and one of the things father keene told me when i came back from one of these trips -- hyun-sook had chosen the name natasha , which i understood was from her watching a " rocky and bullwinkle " cartoon on the american air force station .
this may be one of those myth-buster things that we 'll have to clear up here , in a minute .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
gail couldn 't come .
and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary .
and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map , where he lived .
this is the uncle signing the adoption papers .
now , we went out to dinner that night to celebrate .
the uncle went back to his family , and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner .
and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork , and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons .
we went back to our hotel room , and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was .
this is the third night we were in korea .
the first night we 'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us .
now , i 'd been staying in this room for about three months -- it was a little 15-story korean hotel .
so , the second night , we didn 't keep the kids ' room , because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage .
and the third night , we came back , we 'd just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said , " there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight , so if you want to put the kids five floors below you , there 's a room there . " and gene and i looked at each other and said , " no , we don 't want two 11-year-olds five floors away . "
so , his son said , " dad , i have a sleeping bag , i 'll sleep on the floor . "
and i said , " yeah , i have one too . "
so , tim and i slept on the floor , natasha got one bed , gene got the other -- kids pass out , it 's been very exciting for three days .
we 're lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
we said , " that was so great , we saved this little girl 's life . "
we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
and we fall asleep -- and i 've been in this room , you know , for a couple of months now .
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly , so during the day i always left the window open .
and then , at night , about midnight , they turn the heat off in the hotel . so at about 1 a.m. , the whole room would be like 20 below zero , and i 'd get up .
i 'd been doing this every night i 'd been there .
so , sure enough , it 's one o 'clock , room 's freezing , i go to close the window , and i hear people shouting outside , and i thought , " oh , the bars must have just gotten out . "
and i don 't speak korean , but i 'm hearing these voices , and i 'm not hearing anger , i 'm hearing terror .
so , i open the window , and i look out , and there 's flames coming up the side of our hotel , and the hotel 's on fire .
so , i run over to gene , and i wake him up , and i say , " gene , don 't freak out , i think the hotel 's on fire . "
and now there 's smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we 're on the eleventh floor .
so , the two of us were just like , " oh my god , oh my god . "
so , we 're trying to get natasha up , and we can 't talk to her .
and you know what kids are like when they 've been asleep for like an hour , it 's like they took five valiums -- you know , they 're all over the place .
and we can 't talk to her .
i remember his son had the l.l. bean bootlaces , and we 're trying to do up his laces .
so , we try to get to the door , and we run to the door , and we open the door and it 's like walking into a blast furnace .
there 's people screaming , there 's the sound of glass breaking , there 's these weird thumps .
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
and gene turns around and says , " we 're not going to make it . " and he closes the door , and the whole room is now filled with smoke .
we 're all choking , and there 's smoke pouring through the vents , under the doors . there 's people screaming .
i just remember this unbelievable , just utter chaos .
i remember sitting near the bed , and i was just so -- i had two overwhelming feelings .
one was absolute terror -- it 's like , " oh , please god , i just want to wake up . this has got to be a nightmare , this can 't be happening . please , i just want to wake up , it 's got to be a nightmare . " and the other is unbelievable guilt .
here i 've been , playing god with my friends ' lives , my friends ' son , with natasha 's life , and this what you get when you try playing god , is you hurt people .
i remember just being so frightened and terrified .
and gene , who 's lying on the floor , says , " man , we 've got to soak towels . " i said , " what ? "
he says , " we 've got to soak towels . we 're going to die from the smoke . "
so , we ran to the bathroom , and got towels , and put them over our faces , and the kids faces .
then he said , " do you have gaffer 's tape ? "
i said , " what ? " he said , " do you have gaffer 's tape ? "
i said , " yeah , somewhere in my halliburton . "
he says , " we 've got to stop the smoke . "
he said , " that 's all we can do , we 've got to stop the smoke . "
i mean , gene -- thank god for gene .
so , we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall , we put blankets at the bottom of the door , we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air . and there was a building , a new building , going up , that was being built right outside , across the street from our hotel .
and there , in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump .
eleven people ended up dying in the fire .
five people jumped and died , other people were killed by the smoke .
and there 's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this , and people were shouting in korean .
and i remember , natasha didn 't want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we 'd spent so much time barricading the room .
i didn 't know who it was , i didn 't know what they wanted , and natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out .
i remember a sort of a tussle at the door , trying to get the door open .
in any case , 12 hours later , i mean , they put us in the lobby .
gene ended up using his coat , and his fist in the coat , to break open a liquor cabinet .
people were lying on the floor .
it was one of just the most horrifying nights .
and then 12 hours later , we rented a car , as we had planned to , and drove back to natasha 's village .
and we kept saying , " do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire , like eight hours ago ? "
it 's so weird how life just goes on .
natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers , and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man 's birthday . this guy 's 60 years old .
so it turned into a dual celebration , because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .
so , these are the greenhouse tents .
this is the elders teaching gene their dances .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i couldn 't believe it .
this is the last picture before gene and tim headed back .
the adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through .
like , what could you do for a year ?
so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side , and i photographed them , and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done .
and four months later , the adoption papers came through .
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .
this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop .
her great aunt at the airport .
i had a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years , where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography .
it was like the ultimate perk .
and the pilot , i actually knew -- because they used to let me sit in the jump seat , to tell you how long ago this was .
this is a tri-star , and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat .
and the pilot , jeff cowley , actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha .
this is 28 hours later in atlanta . it 's a very long flight .
just to make things even crazier , gail , natasha 's new mom , was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter .
so you know , if you were writing this , you 'd say , " no , we 've got to write the script differently . "
this is the first night showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts .
gene and gail know everyone in atlanta -- they 're the most social couple imaginable .
so , at this point , natasha doesn 't speak a word of english , other than what little father keene taught her .
this is kylie , her sister , who 's now a doctor , on the right .
this is a deal i had with natasha , which is that when we got to atlanta she could take -- she could cut off my beard .
she never liked it very much .
she learned english in three months .
she entered seventh grade at her own age level .
pledge of allegiance for the first time .
this is her cooking teacher .
natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn 't answer , and they didn 't realize she didn 't actually speak english very well , in the beginning .
but what i noticed , again as an observer , was she was choosing who was going to be on her team ,
and seemed to be very popular very , very quickly .
now , remember the picture , how much she looked like her grandmother , at the beginning ?
people were always telling natasha how much she looks like her mother , gail .
this is a tense moment in the first football game , i think .
and kylie -- i mean , it was almost like kylie was her own child .
she 's being baptized .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children 's history .
and gail and gene did the complete opposite .
they were studying korean ; they bought korean clothes .
gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen , which was that , " once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live happily ever after in atlanta . "
she hates this picture -- it was her first job .
she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king .
the captain of the cheerleaders .
beauty pageant .
used to do their christmas card every year .
gene 's been restoring this car for a million years .
kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea .
her future husband , jeff , was working for canon cameras , and met natasha at the olympic village .
this is her first trip back to korea , so there 's her uncle .
this is her half-sister .
she went back to the village . that 's her best friend 's mother .
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .
it 's just , you know , it was just so interesting , just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there .
this is natasha 's wedding day .
gene is looking a little older .
this is sydney , who 's going to be three years old in a couple of days .
and there 's evan .
natasha , would you just come up , for a second , just maybe to say hello to everybody ?
natasha 's actually never heard me tell the story .
i mean , she -- you know , we 've looked at the pictures together .
natasha : i 've seen pictures millions of times , but today was the first time i 'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .
i started crying .
rick smolan : i 'm sure there 's about 40 things she 's going to tell me ,
" that wasn 't what happened , that wasn 't what you said . " natasha : later , i 'll do that later .
rs : anyway , thank you , mike and richard , so much for letting us tell the story .
thank you all of you .

astronomer dimitar sasselov and his colleagues search for earth-like planets that may , someday , help us answer centuries-old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere . preliminary results show that they have found 706 " candidates " -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with earth-like geochemical characteristics .

dimitar sasselov : how we found hundreds of potential earth-like planets
well , indeed , i 'm very , very lucky .
my talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months -- seemingly unrelated , but as you will see , actually all having to do with the story i want to tell you today .
the first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise , a reburial .
on may 22nd , there was a hero 's reburial in frombork , poland of the 16th-century astronomer who actually changed the world .
he did that , literally , by replacing the earth with the sun in the center of the solar system ,
and then with this simple-looking act , he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution , which many call the copernican revolution .
now that was , ironically , and very befittingly , the way we found his grave .
as it was the custom of the time , copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave , together with 14 others in that cathedral .
dna analysis , one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was copernicus ' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on .
that match was unambiguous .
the dna matched ,
and we know that this was indeed nicolaus copernicus .
now , the connection between biology and dna and life is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because , even back then , his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask : if the earth is just a planet , then what about planets around other stars ?
what about the idea of the plurality of the worlds , about life on other planets ?
in fact , i 'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time .
and at the time , people actually answered that question positively : " yes . "
but there was no evidence .
and here begins 400 years of frustration , of unfulfilled dreams -- the dreams of galileo , giordano bruno , many others -- which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time .
" what is life ? what is the origin of life ?
are we alone ? "
and that especially happened in the last 10 years , at the end of the 20th century , when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology , understanding the code of life , dna , all of that seemed to actually put us , not closer , but further apart from answering those basic questions .
now , the good news .
a lot has happened in the last few years ,
and let 's start with the planets .
let 's start with the old copernican question : are there earths around other stars ?
and as we already heard , there is a way in which we are trying , and now able , to answer that question .
it 's a new telescope .
our team , befittingly i think , named it after one of those dreamers of the copernican time , johannes kepler ,
and that telescope 's sole purpose is to go out , find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy , and tell us how often do planets like our own earth happen to be out there .
the telescope is actually built similarly to the , well-known to you , hubble space telescope ,
except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens , as you would call it as a photographer .
and if , in the next couple of months , you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this , you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night , without any interruption , for the next four years .
the way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the transit method .
it 's actually mini-eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star .
not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that , but if you have a million stars , you 'll find enough planets .
and as you see on this animation , what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star .
we are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this .
all the stars for kepler are just points of light .
but we learn a lot from that : not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size .
how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is .
we learn about its orbit , the period of its orbit and so on .
so , what have we learned ?
well , let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that i 'm here to tell you today .
what kepler does is discover a lot of candidates , which we then follow up and find as planets , confirm as planets .
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
so we count many , many such planets , and they have different sizes .
we do that in our solar system .
in fact , even back during the ancients , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this .
there will be the smaller planets , and there will be the big planets , even back to the time of epicurus and then of course copernicus and his followers .
up until recently , that was the solar system -- four earth-like planets with small radius , smaller than about two times the size of the earth --
and that was of course mercury , venus , mars , and of course the earth , and then the two big , giant planets .
then the copernican revolution brought in telescopes ,
and of course three more planets were discovered .
now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
the small planets dominated , and there was a certain harmony to that , which actually copernicus was very happy to note , and kepler was one of the big proponents of .
so now we have pluto to join the numbers of small planets .
but up until , literally , 15 years ago , that was all we knew about planets .
and that 's what the frustration was .
the copernican dream was unfulfilled .
finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars , with different methods .
unfortunately , as you can see , there was a very different picture .
there was of course an explanation for it :
we only see the big planets ,
so that 's why most of those planets are really in the category of " like jupiter . "
but you see , we haven 't gone very far .
we were still back where copernicus was .
we didn 't have any evidence whether planets like the earth are out there .
and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate , to emerge , to survive .
and we didn 't have the evidence for that .
so today , i 'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope , kepler , has been able to tell us in the last few weeks ,
and , lo and behold , we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus .
you can see here , the small planets dominate the picture .
the planets which are marked " like earth , " [ are ] definitely more than any other planets that we see .
and now for the first time , we can say that .
there is a lot more work we need to do with this .
most of these are candidates .
in the next few years we will confirm them .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
and the statistical result is that planets like our own earth are out there .
our own milky way galaxy is rich in this kind of planets .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
well , first of all , we can study them now that we know where they are .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
so , we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own milky way galaxy harbors .
and the number , as you might expect , is pretty staggering .
it 's about 100 million such planets .
that 's great news . why ?
because with our own little telescope , just in the next two years , we 'll be able to identify at least 60 of them .
so that 's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely , of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years .
we can find what they 're made of , would their atmospheres have water , carbon dioxide , methane .
we know and expect that we 'll see that .
that 's great , but that is not the whole news .
that 's not why i 'm here .
why i 'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part .
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .
and here comes biology -- biology , with its basic question , which still stands unanswered , which is essentially : " if there is life on other planets , do we expect it to be like life on earth ? " and let me immediately tell you here , when i say life , i don 't mean " dolce vita , " good life , human life .
i really mean life on earth , past and present , from microbes to us humans , in its rich molecular diversity , the way we now understand life on earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that , collectively , biochemistry , life as a chemical process , as a chemical phenomenon .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
we need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that .
and that 's a very basic question , which we don 't know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
we don 't need to go to space to answer that question .
and so , that 's what we are trying to do .
and that 's what many people now are trying to do .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
so this is one example that i want to show you here .
when we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life , we think of compartmentalization , keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane , isolated from the rest of the environment , but yet , in an environment in which they actually could originate together .
and in one of our labs , jack szostak 's labs , it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets , on certain types of planets like the earth , where you have some liquid water and some clays -- you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles .
but those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on earth looks like ,
like this .
and they really help molecules , like nucleic acids , like rna and dna , stay inside , develop , change , divide and do some of the processes that we call life .
now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon .
and in a sense , you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge , building a bridge from two sides of the river .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
we don 't want to go blind because there 's too many possibilities , and there is not too much lab , and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .
so that 's what we are building from the left side of the river .
from the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that i just showed you , where we actually tried that , and it feeds back and forth , and we hope to meet in the middle one day .
so why should you care about that ?
why am i trying to sell you a half-built bridge ?
am i that charming ?
well , there are many reasons , and you heard some of them in the short talk today .
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
but there is something more profound here , something deeper .
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago , copernicus ' act did , by changing the way we view space and time .
now it 's about something else , but it 's equally profound .
and half the time , what 's happened is it 's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind , to the earth in a bigger space .
and the more we learn , the more that was reinforced .
you 've all learned that in school -- how small the earth is compared to the immense universe .
and the bigger the telescope , the bigger that universe becomes .
and look at this image of the tiny , blue dot .
this pixel is the earth .
it is the earth as we know it .
it is seen from , in this case , from outside the orbit of saturn .
but it 's really tiny .
we know that .
let 's think of life as that entire planet because , in a sense , it is .
the biosphere is the size of the earth .
life on earth is the size of the earth .
and let 's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms .
what if that copernican insignificance was actually all wrong ?
would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ?
let 's actually try that .
so in space , the earth is very small .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let me try it .
okay , let 's say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be ?
it will be the size of a single , small atom .
it is unimaginably small .
we can 't imagine it .
i mean look , you can see the necktie , but you can 't even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
but that 's not the whole story , you see .
the universe and life are both in space and time .
if that was the age of the universe , then this is the age of life on earth .
think about those oldest living things on earth , but in a cosmic proportion .
this is not insignificant .
this is very significant .
so life might be insignificant in size , but it is not insignificant in time .
life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent , parent and offspring .
so what does this tell us ?
this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the copernican principle , it 's all wrong .
there is immense , powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .
and that potential , that powerful potential , is also our potential , of you and me .
and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth and its biosphere , we 'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it .
and the good news is we can actually , indeed do it .
and let 's do it .
let 's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
and let 's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle .
thank you very much .

hans rosling on hiv : new facts and stunning data visuals
aids was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world , or how we estimate that it was .
what we are showing here is -- on this axis here , i 'm showing percent of infected adults .
and on this axis , i 'm showing dollars per person in income .
and the size of these bubbles , the size of the bubbles here , that shows how many are infected in each country , and the color is the continent .
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
there were quite many people infected in the united states .
and , up there , you see uganda .
they had almost five percent infected , and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country , then .
and they were probably the most infected country in the world .
now , what has happened ?
now you have understood the graph and now , in the next 60 seconds , we will play the hiv epidemic in the world .
but first , i have a new invention here .
i have solidified the beam of the laser pointer .
so , ready , steady , go !
first , we have the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe .
they went upwards like this .
in asia , the first country to be heavily infected was thailand --
they reached one to two percent .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
look , india got many infected , but had a low level .
and almost the same happens here .
see , uganda coming down , zimbabwe coming down , russia went to one percent .
in the last two to three years , we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world .
25 years it took .
but , steady state doesn 't mean that things are getting better , it 's just that they have stopped getting worse .
and it has -- the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected .
it means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of california -- every person , that 's more or less what we have today in the world .
now , let me make a fast replay of botswana .
botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern africa , democratic government , good economy , and this is what happened there .
they started low , they skyrocketed , they peaked up there in 2003 , and now they are down .
but they are falling only slowly , because in botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people .
and if people who are infected are treated , they don 't die of aids .
these percentages won 't come down because people can survive 10 to 20 years .
so there 's some problem with these metrics now .
but the poorer countries in africa , the low-income countries down here , there the rates fall faster , of the percentage infected , because people still die .
in spite of pepfar , the generous pepfar , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .
it 's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries .
but it 's very good that what is done is being done .
but focus now is back on prevention .
it is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it . drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine , or when we will get the vaccine , that 's something more effective -- but the drugs are very costly for the poor .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
so , when we look at the pattern , one thing comes out very clearly : you see the blue bubbles and people say hiv is very high in africa .
i would say , hiv is very different in africa .
you 'll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you 'll find senegal , down here -- the same rate as united states .
and you 'll find madagascar , and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one africa and things go on in one way in africa .
we have to stop that .
it 's not respectful , and it 's not very clever to think that way .
i had the fortune to live and work for a time in the united states .
i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different .
and so it is in africa -- it 's a lot of difference .
so , why is it so high ? is it war ?
no , it 's not . look here .
war-torn congo is down there -- two , three , four percent .
and this is peaceful zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent .
and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo -- they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful zambia -- much higher .
there are now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible , that rapes are terrible ,
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in africa .
so , is it poverty ?
well if you look at the macro level , it seems more money , more hiv .
but that 's very simplistic , so let 's go down and look at tanzania .
i will split tanzania in five income groups , from the highest income to the lowest income , and here we go .
the ones with the highest income , the better off -- i wouldn 't say rich -- they have higher hiv .
the difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent , and it is even bigger among women .
there 's a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that 's not the case .
so , this is the difference within tanzania .
and , i can 't avoid showing kenya .
look here at kenya .
i 've split kenya in its provinces .
here it goes .
see the difference within one african country -- it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .
so , what is it then ?
why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries ?
well , it is more common with multiple partners , there is less condom use , and there is age-disparate sex -- that is , older men tend to have sex with younger women .
we see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries .
but where are they situated ?
i will swap the bubbles to a map .
look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the hiv-infected .
hiv exists all over the world .
look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
brazil has many hiv-infected .
arab countries not so much , but iran is quite high .
they have heroin addiction and also prostitution in iran .
india has many because they are many .
southeast asia , and so on .
but , there is one part of africa -- and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand . on the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now .
unaids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
it could be concurrency .
it could be some virus types .
it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
after all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 .
don 't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .
but -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation , more sexually transmitted diseases , it can be one in 100 .
but what we think is that it could be concurrency .
and what is concurrency ?
in sweden , we have no concurrency .
we have serial monogamy .
vodka , new year 's eve -- new partner for the spring .
vodka , midsummer 's eve -- new partner for the fall .
vodka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
and you collect a big number of exes .
and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .
hiv has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for hiv than others .
probably , it 's a combination of this .
and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
you can get this chart , free .
we have uploaded unaids data on the gapminder site .
and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain .
thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / niall _ ferguson _ the _ 6 _ killer _ apps _ of _ prosperity.html
over the past few centuries , western cultures have been very good at creating general prosperity for themselves . historian niall ferguson asks : why the west , and less so the rest ? he suggests half a dozen big ideas from western culture -- call them the 6 killer apps -- that promote wealth , stability and innovation . and in this new century , he says , these apps are all shareable .
business , culture , economics , global issues

niall ferguson : the 6 killer apps of prosperity
let 's talk about billions .
let 's talk about past and future billions .
we know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
and we know that most of them are dead .
and we also know that most of them live or lived in asia .
and we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long .
let 's talk about billions .
the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth in the world today .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .
and we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call westerners : europeans , north americans , australasians .
19 percent of the world 's population today , westerners own two-thirds of its wealth .
economic historians call this " the great divergence . "
and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you .
it 's basically two ratios of per capita gdp , per capita gross domestic product , so average income .
one , the red line , is the ratio of british to indian per capita income .
and the blue line is the ratio of american to chinese .
and this chart goes back to 1500 .
and you can see here that there 's an exponential great divergence .
they start off pretty close together .
in fact , in 1500 , the average chinese was richer than the average north american .
when you get to the 1970s , which is where this chart ends , the average briton is more than 10 times richer than the average indian .
and that 's allowing for differences in the cost of living .
it 's based on purchasing power parity .
the average american is nearly 20 times richer than the average chinese by the 1970s .
so why ?
this wasn 't just an economic story .
if you take the 10 countries that went on to become the western empires , in 1500 they were really quite tiny -- five percent of the world 's land surface , 16 percent of its population , maybe 20 percent of its income .
by 1913 , these 10 countries , plus the united states , controlled vast global empires -- 58 percent of the world 's territory ,
about the same percentage of its population , and a really huge , nearly three-quarters share of global economic output .
and notice , most of that went to the motherland , to the imperial metropoles , not to their colonial possessions .
now you can 't just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons .
one , empire was the least original thing that the west did after 1500 .
everybody did empire .
they beat preexisting oriental empires like the mughals and the ottomans .
so it really doesn 't look like empire is a great explanation for the great divergence .
in any case , as you may remember , the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s , some considerable time after decolonization .
this is not a new question .
samuel johnson , the great lexicographer , [ posed ] it through his character rasselas in his novel " rasselas , prince of abissinia , " published in 1759 .
" by what means are the europeans thus powerful ; or why , since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest , cannot the asiaticks and africans invade their coasts , plant colonies in their ports , and give laws to their natural princes ?
the same wind that carries them back would bring us thither ? "
that 's a great question . and you know what , it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world -- like ibrahim muteferrika , an ottoman official , the man who introduced printing , very belatedly , to the ottoman empire -- who said in a book published in 1731 , " why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies ? "
unlike rasselas , muteferrika had an answer to that question , which was correct .
he said it was " because they have laws and rules invented by reason . "
it 's not geography .
you may think we can explain the great divergence in terms of geography .
we know that 's wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions .
we took all the germans , we divided them roughly in two , and we gave the ones in the east communism , and you see the result .
within an incredibly short period of time , people living in the german democratic republic
produced trabants , the trabbi , one of the world 's worst ever cars , while people in the west produced the mercedes benz .
if you still don 't believe me , we conducted the experiment also in the korean peninsula .
and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place with , notice , the same basic traditional culture , and we divided them in two , and we gave the northerners communism .
and the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in germany .
not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly , but in almost every other respect , it 's a huge divergence .
which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character , popular explanations for this kind of thing , are really significant .
it 's the ideas .
it 's the institutions .
this must be true because a scotsman said it .
and i think i 'm the only scotsman here at the edinburgh ted . so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .
he was adam smith -- not billy connolly , not sean connery -- though he is very smart indeed .
smith -- and i want you to go and bow down before his statue in the royal mile ; it 's a wonderful statue -- smith , in the " wealth of nations " published in 1776 -- that 's the most important thing that happened that year ...
you bet .
there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies , but ...
" china seems to have been long stationary , and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . "
that is so right and so cool .
and he said it such a long time ago .
but you know , this is a ted audience , and if i keep talking about institutions , you 're going to turn off .
so i 'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .
let 's call them the killer apps .
i want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the west apart from the rest .
and they 're kind of like the apps on your phone , in the sense that they look quite simple .
they 're just icons ; you click on them .
but behind the icon , there 's complex code .
it 's the same with institutions .
there are six which i think explain the great divergence .
one , competition .
two , the scientific revolution .
three , property rights .
four , modern medicine .
five , the consumer society .
and six , the work ethic .
you can play a game and try and think of one i 've missed at , or try and boil it down to just four , but you 'll lose .
let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this , synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .
competition means , not only were there a hundred different political units in europe in 1500 , but within each of these units , there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns .
the ancestor of the modern corporation , the city of london corporation , existed in the 12th century .
nothing like this existed in china , where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity , and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination , which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex confucian essay writing .
the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways , the most important being that , through the experimental method , it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before .
example : benjamin robins 's extraordinary application of newtonian physics to ballistics .
once you do that , your artillery becomes accurate .
think of what that means .
that really was a killer application .
meanwhile , there 's no scientific revolution anywhere else .
the ottoman empire 's not that far from europe , but there 's no scientific revolution there .
in fact , they demolish taqi al-din 's observatory , because it 's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of god .
property rights : it 's not the democracy , folks ; it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights .
that 's what makes the difference between north america and south america .
you could turn up in north america having signed a deed of indenture saying , " i 'll work for nothing for five years .
you just have to feed me . "
but at the end of it , you 've got a hundred acres of land .
that 's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide .
that 's not possible in latin america where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors .
and you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between north and south .
most people in rural north america owned some land by 1900 .
hardly anyone in south america did .
that 's another killer app .
modern medicine in the late 19th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people .
and this was another killer app -- the very opposite of a killer , because it doubled , and then more than doubled , human life expectancy .
it even did that in the european empires .
even in places like senegal , beginning in the early 20th century , there were major breakthroughs in public health , and life expectancy began to rise .
it doesn 't rise any faster after these countries become independent .
the empires weren 't all bad .
the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point .
you need people to want to wear tons of clothes .
you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month ; i guarantee it .
that 's the consumer society ,
and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself .
japan was the first non-western society to embrace it .
the alternative , which was proposed by mahatma gandhi , was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent .
very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi 's road .
finally , the work ethic .
max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant .
he was wrong .
any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work .
we know this because today the work ethic is no longer a protestant , western phenomenon .
in fact , the west has lost its work ethic .
today , the average korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average german -- a thousand .
and this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon , and that is the end of the great divergence .
who 's got the work ethic now ?
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
at the top of the international league table according to the latest pisa study , is the shanghai district of china .
the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap between the u.k. and the u.s. and albania and tunisia .
you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation .
you 're wrong .
in terms of patents , there 's no question that the east is ahead .
not only has japan been ahead for some time , south korea has gone into third place , and china is just about to overtake germany .
why ?
because the killer apps can be downloaded .
it 's open source .
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1500 -- only faster .
this is the great reconvergence , and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime .
because it 's on your watch that this is happening .
it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance .
the average american used to be more than 20 times richer than the average chinese .
now it 's just five times , and soon it will be 2.5 times .
so i want to end with three questions for the future billions , just ahead of 2016 , when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china .
the first is , can you delete these apps , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
the second question is , does the sequencing of the download matter ?
and could africa get that sequencing wrong ?
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights .
warning : that may not work .
and third , can china do without killer app number three ?
that 's the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law .
that 's the basis for the western model of representative government .
now this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei 's studio in shanghai earlier this year .
he 's now free again , having been detained , as you know , for some time .
but i don 't think his studio has been rebuilt .
winston churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938 .
and i think these words really nail it : " it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
it means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained .
that is civilization -- and in its soil grow continually freedom , comfort and culture , " what all tedsters care about most .
" when civilization reigns in any country , a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people . "
that 's so true .
i don 't think the decline of western civilization is inevitable , because i don 't think history operates in this kind of life-cycle model , beautifully illustrated by thomas cole 's " course of empire " paintings .
that 's not the way history works .
that 's not the way the west rose , and i don 't think it 's the way the west will fall .
the west may collapse very suddenly .
complex civilizations do that , because they operate , most of the time , on the edge of chaos .
that 's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
no , we may hang on , despite the huge burdens of debt that we 've accumulated , despite the evidence that we 've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo .
but one thing is for sure , the great divergence is over , folks .
thanks very much .
bruno giussani : niall , i am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that 's booming , which is latin america .
what 's your view on that ?
niall ferguson : well i really am not just talking about the rise of the east ; i 'm talking about the rise of the rest , and that includes south america .
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard , " hey , is south america part of the west ? "
he was an expert in latin american history .
he said , " i don 't know ; i 'll have to think about that . "
that tells you something really important .
i think if you look at what is happening in brazil in particular , but also chile , which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life , there 's a very bright future indeed .
so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it 's a convergence story in eurasia .
bg : and there is this impression that north america and europe are not really paying attention to these trends .
mostly they 're worried about each other .
the americans think that the european model is going to crumble tomorrow .
the europeans think that the american budget is going to explode tomorrow .
and that 's all we seem to be caring about recently .
nf : i think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed world right now -- both sides of the atlantic -- is essentially the same thing taking different forms in terms of political culture .
and it 's a crisis that has its structural facet -- it 's partly to do with demographics .
but it 's also , of course , to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage , excessive borrowing in the private sector .
that crisis , which has been the focus of so much attention , including by me , i think is an epiphenomenon .
the financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon , which has just accelerated this huge shift , which ends half a millennium of western ascendancy .
i think that 's its real importance .

cheryl hayashi : the magnificence of spider silk
i 'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them .
spiders are truly global citizens .
you can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat .
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i 'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
here 's one of our field sites , and just to give you a sense of perspective , this little blue smudge here , that 's one of my collaborators .
this is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here .
turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle .
spiders are not just everywhere , but they 're extremely diverse .
there are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
to put that number into perspective , here 's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates .
spiders are also extremely old .
on the bottom here , this is the geologic timescale , and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present , so the zero here , that would be today .
so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years .
to put that into perspective , this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees , a mere seven million years ago .
all spiders make silk at some point in their life .
most spiders use copious amounts of silk , and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction .
even fossil spiders can make silk , as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .
so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .
it doesn 't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
for example , this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks .
when you look at this orb web , you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
how does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ?
to answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider .
so silk comes out of the spinnerets , and for those of us spider silk biologists , this is what we call the " business end " of the spider .
we spend long days ...
hey ! don 't laugh . that 's my life .
we spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider .
and this is what we see .
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot , and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider , what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual
silk gland . a silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside .
so if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider , and i hope you do , what you would find is a bounty of beautiful , translucent silk glands .
inside each spider , there are hundreds of silk glands , sometimes thousands .
these can be grouped into seven categories .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
in an orb-web-weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what i have depicted here in this picture , let 's start at the one o 'clock position , there 's tubuliform silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
there 's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web .
pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement -- that 's the silk that 's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate .
there 's also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey .
minor ampullate silk is used in web construction .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major ampullate silk .
this is the silk that 's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
but what , exactly , is spider silk ?
spider silk is almost entirely protein .
nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family ,
so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
there are several features that all these silks have in common . they all have a common design , such as they 're all very long -- they 're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins .
they 're very repetitive , and they 're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine .
to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like , this is a dragline silk protein , it 's just a portion of it , from the black widow spider .
this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night .
so what you 're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids , and i 've colored in the glycines with green , and the alanines in red , and so
you can see it 's just a lot of g 's and a 's .
you can also see that there 's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again , so for example there 's a lot of what we call polyalanines , or iterated a 's , aaaaa . there 's ggq . there 's ggy .
you can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words , and these words occur in sentences .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences .
at the top of the screen , you 're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider .
it 's short . and on the bottom , this is the repeat sequence for the egg case , or tubuliform silk protein , for the exact same spider . and you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family .
you can see that the repeat units differ in length . they also differ in sequence .
so i 've colored in the glycines again in green , alanine in red , and the serines , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple .
what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers .
now , it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we 're actually , you know , testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing , which is basically , you know , tugging on one end of the fiber , very amenable .
here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
so what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors .
specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that 's stress . if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers , you can see that there 's a lot of variation , and in fact dragline , or major ampullate silk , is the strongest of these fibers .
we think that 's because the dragline silk , which is used to make the frame and radii for a web , needs to be very strong .
on the other hand , if you were to look at strain -- this is how much a fiber can be extended -- if you look at the maximum value here , again , there 's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform , or the capture spiral filament .
in fact , this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length .
so silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .
in the case of the capture spiral , it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey .
if it wasn 't able to stretch so much , then basically when an insect hit the web , it would just trampoline right off of it .
so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk , an insect is very likely to just bounce right off . but by having really , really stretchy capture spiral silk , the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey .
there 's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make .
we call that the tool kit of a spider .
that 's what the spider has to interact with their environment . but how about variation among spider species , so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders ?
this is an area that 's largely unexplored but here 's a little bit of data i can show you .
this is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders .
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .
it 's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders , like this argiope here , should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey .
what you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the toughness .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i 've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
if you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus .
these are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins .
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
in fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
this is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider .
scytodes doesn 't use a web at all to catch prey . instead , scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it , and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect .
think of hunting with silly string .
that 's how scytodes forages .
we don 't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it 's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile .
it frees us from the constraints of our imagination .
now i 'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber , bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk -- wool , kevlar , and carbon fibers .
and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
it 's the combination of strength , extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special , and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists , so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions .
and the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today .
in addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks , personally , i find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself .
i love when i 'm in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
that 's just the best .
it 's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me , and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk .
the next time you see a spider web , please , pause and look a little closer .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man .
to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte , silk is terrific .
thank you .

clay shirky on institutions vs. collaboration
how do groups get anything done ? right ?
how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value , instead of just being chaos ?
and the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
and we 've had a classic answer for coordination costs , which is , if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people , you start an institution , right ? you raise some resources .
you found something . it can be private or public .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
but you get these resources together .
you found an institution , and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group .
more recently , because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer , which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure , to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system , without regard to institutional models .
so , that 's what i want to talk about today .
i 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
so , i 'm going to start by trying to answer a question that i know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other , and which the internet is purpose-built to answer , which is , where can i get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid ?
so , in new york city , on the first saturday of every summer , coney island , our local , charmingly run-down amusement park , hosts the mermaid parade . it 's an amateur parade ; people come from all over the city ; people get all dressed up .
some people get less dressed up .
young and old , dancing in the streets .
colorful characters , and a good time is had by all .
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself , charming though it is , but rather to these photos .
i didn 't take them . how did i get them ?
and the answer is : i got them from flickr .
flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the web and so forth .
recently , flickr has added an additional function called tagging .
tagging was pioneered by delicious and joshua schachter .
delicious is a social bookmarking service .
tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification .
right ? if i had given this talk last year , i couldn 't do what i just did , because i couldn 't have found those photos .
but instead of saying , we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they 're uploaded , flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos .
so , i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged " mermaid parade . " there were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers , all aggregated and then put under this nice , neat name , shown in reverse chronological order .
and i was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow .
now , what hard problem is being solved here ?
and it 's -- in the most schematic possible view , it 's a coordination problem , right ?
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade .
how do we get those people together to contribute that work ?
the classic answer is to form an institution , right ?
to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals .
and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route .
first of all , when you form an institution , you take on a management problem , right ?
no good just hiring employees ,
you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth .
secondly , you have to bring structure into place .
right ? you have to have economic structure .
you have to have legal structure .
you have to have physical structure .
and that creates additional costs .
third , forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .
you notice we haven 't got everybody who has a photo .
you can 't hire everyone in a company , right ?
you can 't recruit everyone into a governmental organization .
you have to exclude some people .
and fourth , as a result of that exclusion , you end up with a professional class . look at the change here .
we 've gone from people with photos to photographers .
right ? we 've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade , or whatever else they 're sent out to photograph .
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure , which is the flickr answer , you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals , rather than moving the individuals to the problem .
you arrange the coordination in the group , and by doing that you get the same outcome , without the institutional difficulties .
you lose the institutional imperative .
you lose the right to shape people 's work when it 's volunteer effort , but you also shed the institutional cost , which gives you greater flexibility .
what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination .
and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems .
right . you 'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone ,
and you stopped making plans .
you just said , " i 'll call you when i get there . "
" call me when you get off work . " right ?
that is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning .
right . we 're now able to do that kind of thing with groups .
to say instead of , we must make an advance plan , we must have a five-year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be , or whatever , you can just say , let 's coordinate the group effort , and let 's deal with it as we go , because we 're now well-enough coordinated that we don 't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do .
so here 's another example . this one 's somewhat more somber .
these are photos on flickr tagged " iraq . "
and everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the mermaid parade is even harder here .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
it 's taken over a wider geographic area .
the photos are spread out over a longer period of time .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , approximately ten photos per photographer , is a lie .
it 's mathematically true , but it doesn 't really talk about anything important -- because in these systems , the average isn 't really what matters .
what matters is this .
this is a graph of photographs tagged iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos .
and it 's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer .
you can see here , over at the end , our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos , and you can see there 's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos .
then there 's dozens of people who 've taken dozens of photos .
and by the time we get around here , we get ten or fewer photos , and then there 's this long , flat tail .
and by the time you get to the middle , you 've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each .
this is called a power-law distribution .
it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like -- this is often what you get . right ?
the math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever 's in the nth position is doing about one-nth of whatever 's being measured , relative to the person in the first position .
so , we 'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos , and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did .
so , the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter .
but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long , flat tail .
and curiously , in these systems , as they grow larger , the systems don 't converge ; they diverge more .
in bigger systems , the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer , so the imbalance increases .
you can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted . here 's how heavily :
if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system , they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers .
if you go down to five percent , you 're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos .
if you go down to one percent , exclude 99 percent of the group effort , you 're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos .
and because of this left weighting , the average is actually here , way to the left .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount .
that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same , but they 're not at all .
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80 / 20 rule , this is what 's going on . right ?
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue , 20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources -- this is the shape people are talking about when that happens .
institutions only have two tools : carrots and sticks .
and the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone .
the costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame .
the institutional model always pushes leftwards , treating these people as employees .
the institutional response is , i can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great ,
that 's what i 'll do .
the cooperative infrastructure model says , why do you want to give up a quarter of the value ?
if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value , re-engineer the system .
don 't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people . build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount .
so the coordination response asks not , how are these people as employees , but rather , what is their contribution like ? right ?
we have over here psycho milt , a flickr user , who has contributed one , and only one , photo titled " iraq . "
and here 's the photo . right . labeled , " bad day at work . "
right ? so the question is , do you want that photo ? yes or no .
the question is not , is psycho milt a good employee ?
and the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle .
when you 're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions , when you 're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want , that 's an institution-as-enabler world .
you can hire those people as employees , you can coordinate their work and you can get some output .
but when you 're down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that 's institution as obstacle .
institutions hate being told they 're obstacles .
one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self-preservation .
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n .
right ? so , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of coordinating the value , they go through something a little bit like the kubler-ross stages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a fatal illness : denial , anger , bargaining , acceptance .
most of the cooperative systems we 've seen haven 't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase .
many , many institutions are still in denial , but we 're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining .
there 's a wonderful , small example going on right now .
in france , a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool , right , because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue .
you can follow this in the guardian .
it 's actually quite entertaining .
the bigger question is , what do you do about the value down here ?
right ? how do you capture that ?
and institutions , as i 've said , are prevented from capturing that .
steve ballmer , now ceo of microsoft , was criticizing linux a couple of years ago , and he said , " oh , this business of thousands of programmers contributing to linux , this is a myth .
we 've looked at who 's contributed to linux , and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who 've only done one thing . " right ?
you can hear this distribution under that complaint .
and you can see why , from ballmer 's point of view , that 's a bad idea , right ?
we hired this programmer , he came in , he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea .
right ? bad hire . right ?
the psycho milt question is , was it a good idea ?
what if it was a security patch ?
what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit , of which windows has not some , [ but ] several ?
do you want that patch , right ?
the fact that a single programmer can , without having to move into a professional relation to an institution , improve linux once and never be seen from again , should terrify ballmer .
because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks , but is part of cooperative systems of open-source software , of file sharing , of the wikipedia . i 've used a lot of examples from flickr , but there are actually stories about this from all over .
meetup , a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .
when scott heiferman founded meetup , he thought it would be used for , you know , train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups .
the inventors don 't know what the invention is .
number one group on meetup right now , most chapters in most cities with most members , most active ?
stay-at-home moms . right ?
in the suburbanized , dual-income united states , stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local , small-scale neighborhoods .
so they 're reinventing it , using these tools .
meetup is the platform , but the value here is in social infrastructure .
if you want to know what technology is going to change the world , don 't pay attention to 13-year-old boys -- pay attention to young mothers , because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn 't materially make their lives better .
this is so much more important than xbox , but it 's a lot less glitzy .
i think this is a revolution .
i think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged .
and i use that word advisedly .
it 's a revolution in that it 's a change in equilibrium .
it 's a whole new way of doing things , which includes new downsides .
in the united states right now , a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources -- she 's a reporter for the new york times -- her sources , in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case .
and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws .
the shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws -- that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source .
this is happening , however , against the background of the rise of web logging .
web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization .
it has de-professionalized publishing .
want to publish globally anything you think today ?
it is a one-button operation that you can do for free .
that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization .
and so the shield law , as much as we want it -- we want a professional class of truth-tellers -- it is becoming increasingly incoherent , because the institution is becoming incoherent .
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots , trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists .
and the answer to that question is , it doesn 't matter , because that 's not the right question .
journalism was an answer to an even more important question , which is , how will society be informed ?
how will they share ideas and opinions ?
and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism , it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .
so as much as we want the shield laws , the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent .
here 's another example .
pro-ana , the pro-ana groups .
these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs , bulletin boards , other kinds of cooperative infrastructure , and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice .
they post pictures of thin models , which they call " thinspiration . "
they have little slogans , like " salvation through starvation . " they even have lance armstrong-style bracelets , these red bracelets , which signify , in the small group , i am trying to maintain my eating disorder .
they trade tips , like , if you feel like eating something , clean a toilet or the litter box . the feeling will pass .
we 're used to support groups being beneficial .
we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .
but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral .
a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group .
now , when the larger group is a bunch of drunks , and the small group wants to stay sober , then we think , that 's a great support group .
but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice , then we 're horrified .
what 's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we 're used to , came from the institutions that were framing them , and not from the infrastructure .
once the infrastructure becomes generically available , the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone , including people pursuing these kinds of goals .
so , there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides . and of course , in the current environment , one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors trying to influence global affairs , and taking advantage of these .
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .
it was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
now , this is the part of the talk where i tell you what 's going to come as a result of all of this , but i 'm running out of time , which is good , because i don 't know .
right . as with the printing press , if it 's really a revolution , it doesn 't take us from point a to point b .
it takes us from point a to chaos .
the printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos , moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia , when we finally knew what the new unit was : the nation state .
now , i 'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage , and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives -- like deciding in advance what 's going to happen , or the profit motive -- the more leverage they 'll get .
and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure , and the more rigidly managed , and the more they rely on information monopolies , the greater the pressure is going to be .
and that 's going to happen one arena at a time , one institution at a time . the forces are general , but the results are going to be specific .
and so the point here is not , " this is wonderful , " or " we 're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework . "
it 's going to be much more complicated than that .
but the point is that it 's going to be a massive readjustment .
and since we can see it in advance and know it 's coming , my argument is essentially : we might as well get good at it .
thank you very much .

peter reinhart on bread
this is a wheat bread , a whole wheat bread , and it 's made with a new technique that i 've been playing around with , and developing and writing about which , for lack of a better name , we call the epoxy method .
and i call it an epoxy method because -- it 's not very appetizing . i understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy , what 's epoxy ?
it 's two resins that are , sort of , in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue , but when you put the two together , something happens . a bond takes place , and you get this very strong , powerful adhesive .
well , in this technique , what i 've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world , the artisan bread-baking community , has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we 've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads .
and let 's face it , everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains .
we finally , after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option , we 're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them .
the challenge , though , for a wholegrain baker is , you know , how do you make it taste good ?
because whole grain -- it 's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread . white flour is sweet .
it 's mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ? it 's -- thank you -- sugar , yes .
so a baker , and a good baker , knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch .
with whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
you 've got bran , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber ,
for the bran is fiber .
it 's got germ . those are the good things , but those aren 't the tastiest parts of the wheat .
so whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads ,
and people don 't like to eat , quote , health food . they like to eat healthy and healthily , but when we think of something as a health food , we think of it as something we eat out of obligation , not out of passion and love for the flavor .
and ultimately , the challenge of the baker , the challenge of every culinary student , of every chef , is to deliver flavor .
flavor is king . flavor rules .
i call it the flavor rule . flavor rules .
and -- and
you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once , but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it , right ?
so , this is the challenge for this bread .
we 're going to try this at lunch , and i 'll explain a bit more about it , but it 's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --
this attempt , again , at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened .
it 's just dough that is wet .
it 's hydrated dough we call " the soaker " -- that helps to start enzyme activity .
and enzymes are the secret , kind of , ingredient in dough that brings out flavor .
it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch .
that 's what enzymes are doing .
and so , if we can release some of those , they become accessible to us in our palate .
they become accessible to the yeast as food .
they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust .
the other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment .
and it 's made -- it can be a sourdough starter , or what we call a " biga " or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it ,
and that starts to develop flavor also .
and on day two , we put those two pieces together . that 's the epoxy .
and we 're hoping that , sort of , the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough ,
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients , we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain .
that 's the challenge . okay , so , now , what we --
in the journey of wheat , let 's go back and look at these 12 stages .
i 'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them .
okay , we 're going to start with the first stage .
and this is what every student has to begin with .
everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is " mise en place , "
which is just a french way of saying , " get organized . "
everything in its place . first stage .
so in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients .
stage two is mixing . we take the ingredients and we mix them .
we have to develop the gluten .
there 's no gluten in flour . there 's only the potential for gluten .
here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we 've got glutenin and gliadin ,
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread . but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other , they create a stronger molecule , a stronger protein we call gluten .
and so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
then we get into fermentation , the third stage , which is really where the flavor develops .
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --
essentially it 's burping and sweating , which is what bread is . it 's yeast burps and sweat .
and somehow , this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food ,
and we 're going to explore that in a minute . but then , quickly through the next few stages .
we , after it 's fermented and it 's developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
and then we take those units and we shape them . we give them a little pre-shape , usually a round or a little torpedo shape , sometimes .
that 's called " rounding . "
and there 's a short rest period . it can be for a few seconds .
it can be for 20 or 30 minutes . we call that resting or benching .
then we go into final shaping , " panning " -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan .
this takes a second , but it 's a distinctive stage .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
and then , stage nine .
the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages . again , developing more flavor .
the final fermentation takes place in stage nine .
we call it " proofing . "
proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape , and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 .
three transformations take place in the oven .
the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust .
they give us that beautiful brown crust .
only the crust can caramelize . it 's the only place that gets hot enough .
inside , the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates .
when it gets to about 160 degrees , the proteins all line up and they create structure , the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread .
and the starches , when they reach about 180 degrees , gelatinize .
and gelatinization is yet another oven transformation .
coagulation , caramelization and gelatinization --
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that 's around them , they -- they kind of swell , and then they burst .
and they burst , and they spill their guts into the bread .
so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats -- sweat , burps and starch guts .
again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
and stage 11 , we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .
there 's a little carry-over baking .
the proteins have to set up , strengthen and firm up .
and then we have stage 12 , which the textbooks call " packaging , " but my students call " eating . "
and so , we 're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat , and in a few minutes we will try this , and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker 's mission of pulling out flavor .
but i want to go back now and revisit these steps , and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation , because i really believe that all things can be understood --
and this is not my own idea . this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels : the literal , the metaphoric or poetic level , the political or ethical level . and ultimately , the mystical or sometimes called the " anagogical " level .
it 's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal .
in fact , dante says you can 't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level ,
so that 's why we 're talking literally about bread .
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question , " what is it about bread that 's so special ? "
and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor .
because what happens is , bread begins as wheat or any other grain .
but what 's wheat ? wheat is a grass that grows in the field .
and , like all grasses , at a certain point it puts out seeds .
and we harvest those seeds , and those are the wheat kernels .
now , in order to harvest it -- i mean , what 's harvesting ?
it 's just a euphemism for killing , right ?
i mean , that 's what 's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig , you know ?
yes , we slaughter , you know . yes , that 's life .
we harvest the wheat , and in harvesting it , we kill it .
now , wheat is alive , and as we harvest it , it gives up its seeds .
now , at least with seeds we have the potential for future life .
we can plant those in the ground . and we save some of those for the next generation .
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
and at that point , the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity .
it 's not only been killed , but it 's been denied any potential for creating future life .
so we turn it into flour .
so as i said , i think bread is a transformational food .
the first transformation -- and , by the way , the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else .
o.k. ? radical , not subtle .
not like hot water made cold , or cold water turned hot , but water boiled off and becoming steam .
that 's a transformation , two different things .
well , in this case , the first transformation is alive to dead .
i 'd call that radical .
so , we 've got now this flour .
and what do we do ? we add some water .
in stage one , we weigh it .
in stage two , we add water and salt to it , mix it together , and we create something that we call " clay . "
it 's like clay .
and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call " leaven . "
in this case , it 's yeast , but yeast is leaven . what does leaven mean ?
leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify , to bring to life .
by the way , what 's the hebrew word for clay ? adam .
you see , the baker , in this moment , has become , in a sense , sort of , the god of his dough , you know , and his dough , well , while it 's not an intelligent life form , is now alive .
and we know it 's alive because in stage three , it grows . growth is the proof of life .
and while it 's growing , all these literal transformations are taking place .
enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sugars , turning them into acids .
in other words , personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker .
and the baker 's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product .
a subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it 's all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . that 's the art of baking .
so all these things are determined by the baker , and the bread goes through some stages , and characters develop .
and then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
and as they 're shaped , they 're raised again , all along proving that they 're alive , and developing character .
and at stage 10 , we take it to the oven .
it 's still dough . nobody eats bread dough --
a few people do , i think , but not too many .
i 've met some dough eaters , but -- it 's not the staff of life , right ? bread is the staff of life .
but dough is what we 're working with , and we take that dough to the oven ,
and it goes into the oven . as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees , it passes what we call the " thermal death point . "
students love that tdp . they think it 's the name of a video game . but it 's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there .
the yeast , whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough , to enliven it , to vivify it , in order to complete its mission , which is also to turn this dough into bread , has to give up its life .
so you see the symbolism at work ? it 's starting to come forth a little bit , you know .
it 's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
third transformation . first transformation , alive to dead .
second transformation , dead brought back to life .
third transformation , alive to dead --
but dough to bread .
or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
and it 's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life .
this is the product that everyone in the world eats , that is so difficult to give up .
it 's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
it 's used as a symbol for transformation .
and so , as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that , again completing the life cycle , you know , we have a chance to essentially ingest that --
it nurtures us , and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this .
so this is what i 've learned from bread .
this is what bread has taught me in my journey .
and what we 're going to attempt to do with this bread here , again , is to use , in addition to everything we talked about , this bread we 're going to call " spent grain bread " because , as you know , bread-making is very similar to beer-making .
beer is basically liquid bread , or bread is solid beer .
and --
they -- they 're invented around the same time . i think beer came first .
and the egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot , egyptian sun , and it turned into bread .
but we 've got this bread , and what i did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we 've added into it the spent grain from beer-making .
and if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer .
i like dark spent grain . today we 're using a light spent grain that 's actually from , like , some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that 's been toasted .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
we 're going to take some of that , and put it into the bread .
so now we not only have a high-fiber bread , but now fiber on top of fiber . and so this is , again , hopefully not only a healthy bread , but a bread that you will enjoy .
so , if i , kind of , break this bread , maybe we can share this now a little bit here .
we 'll start a little piece here ,
and i 'm going to take a little piece here --
i think i 'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .
i 'll leave you with what i call the baker 's blessing .
may your crust be crisp , and your bread always rise .
thank you .

mark applebaum : the mad scientist of music
i thought if i skipped it might help my nerves , but i 'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that , so that was a bad idea .
anyway , i was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer , presumably because it appeals to my well-known and abundant narcissism .
and i 'm not kidding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
so , but the thing is , a dilemma quickly arose , and that is that i 'm really bored with music , and i 'm really bored with the role of the composer , and so i decided to put that idea , boredom , as the focus of my presentation to you today .
and i 'm going to share my music with you , but i hope that i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story , tells a story about how i used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention , and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that i was asking in my discipline , and how boredom also , in a sense , pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional , narrow definition of a composer .
what i 'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano .
okay , i wrote that .
no , it 's not - oh , why thank you .
no , no , i didn 't write that .
in fact , that was a piece by beethoven , and so i was not functioning as a composer .
just now i was functioning in the role of the interpreter , and there i am , interpreter .
so , an interpreter of what ? of a piece of music , right ?
but we can ask the question , " but is it music ? " and i say this rhetorically , because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is , of course , a piece of music , but i put this here now because , just to set it in your brains for the moment , because we 're going to return to this question .
it 's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation .
so here we have this piece of music by beethoven , and my problem with it is , it 's boring .
i mean , you - i 'm just like , a hush , huh -- it 's like -- it 's beethoven , how can you say that ?
no , well , i don 't know , it 's very familiar to me .
i had to practice it as a kid , and i 'm really sick of it . so -- i would , so what i might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so i might take the opening , like this idea -- and then i might substitute -- and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there -- so that might be the kind of thing -- why thank you .
that would be the kind of thing that i would do , and it 's not necessarily better than the beethoven .
in fact , i think it 's not better than it . the thing is -- --
it 's more interesting to me . it 's less boring for me .
i 'm really leaning into me , because i , because i have to think about what decisions i 'm going to make on the fly as that beethoven text is running in time through my head and i 'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations i 'm going to make to it .
so this is an engaging enterprise for me , and i 've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there , and now my face appears twice , so i think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise .
but it 's an engaging one , and it 's interesting to me for a while , but then i get bored with it , and by it , i actually mean , the piano , because it becomes , it 's this familiar instrument , it 's timbral range is actually pretty compressed , at least when you play on the keyboard , and if you 're not doing things like listening to it after you 've lit it on fire or something like that , you know .
it gets a little bit boring , and so pretty soon i go through other instruments , they become familiar , and eventually i find myself designing and constructing my own instrument , and i brought one with me today , and i thought i would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like .
you gotta have doorstops , that 's important .
i 've got combs . they 're the only combs that i own .
they 're all mounted on my instruments .
i can actually do all sorts of things . i can play with a violin bow . i don 't have to use the chopsticks .
so we have this sound .
and with a bank of live electronics , i can change the sounds radically .
like that , and like this .
and so forth .
so this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument , which i think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor , and the nice thing about - this instrument is called the mouseketeer ...
and the cool thing about it is i 'm the world 's greatest mouseketeer player .
okay ?
so in that regard , this is one of the things , this is one of the privileges of being , and here 's another role , the inventor , and by the way , when i told you that i 'm the world 's greatest , if you 're keeping score , we 've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism .
i know some of you are just , you know , bingo ! or , i don 't know .
anyway , so this is also a really enjoyable role .
i should concede also that i 'm the world 's worst mouseketeer player , and it was this distinction that i was most worried about when i was on that prior side of the tenure divide .
i 'm glad i 'm past that . we 're not going to go into that .
i 'm crying on the inside . there are still scars .
anyway , but i guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity , but as i 've presented them to you today , they 're actually solitary enterprises , and so pretty soon i want to commune with other people , and so i 'm delighted that in fact i get to compose works for them .
i get to write , sometimes for soloists and i get to work with one person , sometimes full orchestras , and i work with a lot of people , and this is probably the capacity , the role creatively for which i 'm probably best known professionally .
now , some of my scores as a composer look like this , and others look like this , and some look like this , and i make all of these by hand , and it 's really tedious .
it takes a long , long time to make these scores , and right now i 'm working on a piece that 's 180 pages in length , and it 's just a big chunk of my life , and i 'm just pulling out hair .
i have a lot of it , and that 's a good thing i suppose .
so this gets really boring and really tiresome for me , so after a while the process of notating is not only boring , but i actually want the notation to be more interesting , and so that 's pushed me to do other projects like this one .
this is an excerpt from a score called " the metaphysics of notation . "
the full score is 72 feet wide .
it 's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation .
let 's zoom in on one section of it right here . you can see it 's rather detailed . i do all of this with drafting templates , with straight edges , with french curves , and by freehand , and the 72 feet was actually split into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed around the cantor arts center museum lobby balcony , and it appeared for one year in the museum , and during that year , it was experienced as visual art most of the week , except , as you can see in these pictures , on fridays , from noon til one , and only during that time , various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs .
now this was a really exciting experience for me .
it was gratifying musically , but i think the more important thing is it was exciting because i got to take on another role , especially given that it appeared in a museum , and that is as visual artist .
we 're going to fill up the whole thing , don 't worry .
i am multitudes .
would say , like , " oh , you 're being a dilettante , " and maybe that 's true . i can understand how , i mean , because i don 't have a pedigree in visual art and i don 't have any training , but it 's just something that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
i can understand the question , though . " but is it music ? " i mean , there 's not any traditional notation .
i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece , " s-tog , " which i made when i was living in copenhagen .
i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations , and the players , who are synchronized with stopwatches , follow the timetables , which are listed in minutes past the hour .
so this is a case of actually adapting something , or maybe stealing something , and then turning it into a musical notation .
another adaptation would be this piece .
i took the idea of the wristwatch , and i turned it into a musical score .
i made my own faces , and had a company fabricate them , and the players follow these scores .
they follow the second hands , and as they pass over the various symbols , the players respond musically .
here 's another example from another piece , and then its realization .
so in these two capacities , i 've been scavenger , in the sense of taking , like , the subway map , right , or thief maybe , and i 've also been designer , in the case of making the wristwatches .
and once again , this is , for me , interesting .
another role that i like to take on is that of the performance artist .
some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements , and i often perform them . i want to show you a clip from a piece called " echolalia . " this is actually being performed by brian mcwhorter , who is an extraordinary performer .
let 's watch a little bit of this , and please notice the instrumentation .
okay , i hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the intonation was a little questionable .
let 's watch just another clip .
you can see the mayhem continues , and there 's , you know , there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins . here 's a piece that has an even more unusual , more peculiar instrumentation .
this is " tlon , " for three conductors and no players .
this was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language , which produced no decibels to speak of , but affectively , psychologically , was a very loud experience .
so , yeah , i get it , with , like , the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors , people might , you know , wonder , yeah , " is this music ? " but let 's move on to a piece where clearly i 'm behaving myself , and that is my " concerto for orchestra . "
you 're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip .
this , in fact , is not the title of this piece . i was a bit mischievous . in fact , to make it more interesting , i put a space right in here , and this is the actual title of the piece .
let 's continue with that same excerpt .
it 's better with a florist , right ?
or at least it 's less boring . let 's watch a couple more clips .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
i was playing nice . i had to write the orchestra bits , right ?
okay ? but then there was this other stuff , right ?
there was the florist , and i can understand that , once again , we 're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally , but let 's look at one last piece today i 'm going to share with you .
this is going to be a piece called " aphasia , " and it 's for hand gestures synchronized to sound , and this invites yet another role , and final one i 'll share with you , which is that of the choreographer .
and the score for the piece looks like this , and it instructs me , the performer , to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape , and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples .
i recorded an awesome singer , and i took the sound of his voice in my computer , and i warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you 're about to hear .
and i 'll perform just an excerpt of " aphasia " for you here . okay ?
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
yeah , okay , that 's kind of weird stuff .
is it music ? here 's how i want to conclude .
i 've decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
the important question is , " is it interesting ? " and i follow this question , not worrying about " is it music ? " not worrying about the definition of the thing that i 'm making .
i allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me , and i don 't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion , some paradigm , of what music composition is supposed to be , and that has actually urged me , in a sense , to take on a whole bunch of different roles , and so what i want you to think about is , to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline , and , okay , i 'm going to put one extra little footnote in here , because , like , i realized i mentioned some psychological defects earlier , and we also , along the way , had a fair amount of obsessive behavior , and there was some delusional behavior and things like that , and here i think we could say that this is an argument for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia , at least in the popular use of the term , and i really mean dissociative identity disorder , okay .
anyway , despite those perils , i would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work , whether they are neighboring or far-flung from your professional definition .
and with that , i thank you very much .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / alison _ gopnik _ what _ do _ babies _ think.html
" babies and young children are like the r & d division of the human species , " says psychologist alison gopnik . her research explores the sophisticated intelligence-gathering and decision-making that babies are really doing when they play .

alison gopnik : what do babies think ?
what is going on in this baby 's mind ?
if you 'd asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric -- that he couldn 't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
in the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
so in some ways , we think that this baby 's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
let me give you just one example of this .
one thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby .
after all , one of the things that 's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn 't actually exactly like what we think and feel .
anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
now the question is : how could we ask them ?
babies , after all , can 't talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
what we did -- betty rapacholi , who was one of my students , and i -- was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
now all of the babies , even in berkley , like the crackers and don 't like the raw broccoli .
but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
and she would act as if she liked it or she didn 't .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn 't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person .
but half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , " mmmmm , broccoli .
i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . "
and then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she 'd go , " eww , yuck , crackers .
i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . "
so she 'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
we did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
and then she would simply put her hand out and say , " can you give me some ? " so the question is : what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
on the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn 't figure this out .
but then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
so there are two really remarkable things about this . the first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don 't always want the same thing .
and what 's more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn 't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
and this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that 's actually demonstrated it .
the question you might ask though is : why do children learn so much ?
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
i mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
and actually in many ways , they 're worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there 's actually an answer .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there 's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
and crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food .
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
so they 're very , very good at pecking for grain , and they 're not much good at doing anything else .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
other creatures , like the crows , aren 't very good at doing anything in particular , but they 're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
and of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
we 're smarter , we 're more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
my son is 23 .
and at least until they 're 23 , we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
all right , why would we see this correlation ?
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world ,
but it has one big disadvantage .
and that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you 're going to be helpless .
so you don 't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , " a slingshot or maybe a spear might work . which would actually be better ? " you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
and the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
so the idea is that we have this early period when we 're completely protected .
we don 't have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
and then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
so they 're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we 're production and marketing .
we have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species -- kind of like caterpillars and butterflies -- except that they 're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring ,
and we 're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that 's what they 're for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
and in fact , the baby 's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
but real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
and there 's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
they go out and test it against the evidence .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
and some 10 years ago , i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
so if you want to know what 's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , i think it actually looks something like this .
this is reverend bayes 's notebook .
so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
how could it be that children are doing statistics ?
so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector . this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
let me mention just one that we did with tumar kushner , my student .
if i showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
but actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn 't ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
so we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
and sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
they 're just learning how to count .
but unconsciously , they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
and in studies we 've just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we 've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
so in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
when children do experiments we call it " getting into everything " or else " playing . "
and there 's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
here 's one from cristine legare 's lab .
what cristine did was use our blicket detectors .
and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn 't , and then she showed them an anomaly .
and what you 'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
boy : how about this ?
same as the other side .
alison gopnik : okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
ag : okay , he 's got his experimental notebook out .
boy : what 's making this light up .
i don 't know .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
boy : oh , it 's because this needs to be like this ,
and this needs to be like this .
ag : okay , hypothesis two .
boy : that 's why .
oh .
ag : now this is his next idea .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
not working either .
boy : oh , because the light goes only to here ,
not here .
oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here ,
but this doesn 't have electricity .
ag : okay , that 's a fourth hypothesis .
boy : it 's lighting up .
so when you put four .
so you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
ag : okay , there 's his fifth hypothesis .
now that is a particularly -- that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something ,
what they really do is do a series of experiments .
this is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
well , what 's it like to be this kind of creature ?
what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
and i think just the opposite is true .
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
now here 's what we know about how adult consciousness works .
and adults ' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
so what happens for adults is we decide that something 's relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
our consciousness of that thing that we 're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible ,
more plastic , better at learning ,
and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
so babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
but they 're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
and if you actually look in their brains , you see that they 're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven 't come on yet .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they 're bad at not paying attention .
so they 're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that 's important .
that 's the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that we 've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new , or when we 're in a new city for the first time .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
and by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you 've been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
it 's like being in love in paris for the first time after you 've had three double-espressos .
that 's a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o 'clock in the morning .
now it 's good to be a grownup .
i don 't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
it 's good to be a grownup .
we can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
but if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at ted in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .

torsten reil builds better animations
i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and hollywood movies are being made .
that technology is simulating humans .
it 's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body .
now , before i talk more about that technology , let 's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games .
this is a clip from a game called " grand theft auto 3 . "
we already saw that briefly yesterday .
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game . it 's one of the most successful games of all time .
but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive .
they pretty much look the same .
i 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again . and you can see he looks always the same .
the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters .
they are a graphical visualization of a character .
to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what 's going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
so , he or she sits down , animates it , and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen , and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
now , the result of that is that you can 't have real interactivity .
all you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times .
it also means that games aren 't really going to be as surprising as they could be , because you only get out of it , at least in terms of the character , what you actually put into it .
there 's no real emergence there .
and thirdly , as i said , most of the animations are very repetitive because of that .
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body .
and maybe , if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because , i mean , it 's very , very trivial .
if i push chris a bit , like this , for example , he 'll react to it .
if i push him from a different angle , he 'll react to it differently , and that 's because he has a physical body , and because he has the motor skills to control that body .
it 's a very trivial thing .
it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment , at all .
thank you very much . chris anderson : that 's it ?
torsten reil : that 's it , yes .
so , that 's what we 're trying to simulate -- not chris specifically , i should say , but humans in general .
now , we started working on this a while ago at oxford university , and we tried to start very simply .
what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk .
that stick figure is physically stimulated . you can see it here on the screen .
so , it 's subject to gravity , has joints , etc .
if you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work .
and for that , we use the neural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
it 's called the central pattern generator .
so , we simulated that as well , and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .
for that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms .
we heard about those already yesterday , and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .
but , just briefly , the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks , in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning .
you hook these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
at the beginning , they 're all going to be very boring .
most of them won 't move at all , but some of them might make a tiny step .
those are then selected by the algorithm , reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .
and you repeat that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
so that was the idea behind this .
when we started this , i set up the simulation one evening .
it took about three to four hours to run the simulation .
i got up the next morning , went to the computer and looked at the results , and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line , like i 've just demonstrated , and this is what i got instead .
so , it was back to the drawing board for us .
we did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
so , what you 'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that 's learning how to walk using artificial evolution .
at the beginning , it can 't walk at all , but it will get better and better over time .
so , this is the one that can 't walk at all .
now , after five generations of applying evolutionary process , the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better .
generation 10 and it 'll take a few steps more --
still not quite there .
but now , after generation 20 , it actually walks in a straight line without falling over .
that was the real breakthrough for us .
it was , academically , quite a challenging project , and once we had reached that stage , we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it .
now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds .
what you see here is the character standing there , and there 's an obstacle that we put in its way .
and what you see is , it 's going to fall over the obstacle .
now , the interesting bit is , if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right , which is what i 'm doing now , here , it will fall over it in a completely different way .
and again , if you move the obstacle a tiny bit , it 'll again fall differently .
now , what you see , by the way , at the top there , are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles .
okay . that 's the video . thanks .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , blocky biped .
what we really wanted was a full human body . so we started the company .
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
it 's got to be relatively fast , so you can run it on a normal machine , but it 's got to be accurate enough , so it looks good enough , basically .
so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing , and tried to make it as realistic as possible .
what you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body .
i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . ,
but what we 've done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
now , what i 'm going to do right now , in a moment , is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens .
nothing really interesting , basically .
it falls over , but it falls over like a rag doll , basically .
the reason for that is that there 's no intelligence in it .
it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
so , this character now has motor skills in the upper body --
nothing in the legs yet , in this particular one .
but what it will do -- i 'm going to push it again .
it will realize autonomously that it 's being pushed .
it 's going to stick out its hands .
it 's going to turn around into the fall , and try and catch the fall .
so that 's what you see here .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well .
so here , we 've got the same character .
i 'm going to push it a bit harder now , harder than i just pushed chris .
but what you 'll see is -- it 's going to receive a push now from the left .
what you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter-balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
i 'll show you this again .
and then , finally hits the floor .
now , this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions , again , just as i 've done .
that 's something that you cannot do right now .
at the moment , you only have empty computer graphics in games .
what this is now is a real simulation . that 's what i want to show you now .
so , here 's the same character with the same behavior i 've just shown you , but now i 'm just going to push it from different directions .
first , starting with a push from the right .
this is all slow motion , by the way , so we can see what 's going on .
now , the angle will have changed a tiny bit , so you can see that the reaction is different .
again , a push , now this time from the front .
and you see it falls differently .
and now from the left --
and it falls differently .
that was really exciting for us to see that .
that was the first time we 've seen that .
this is the first time the public sees this as well , because we have been in stealth mode .
i haven 't shown this to anybody yet .
now , just a fun thing :
what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it , but it 's got the same ai in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface , like ice .
we just did that for a laugh , just to see what happens .
and this is what happens .
it 's nothing we had to do about this .
we just took this character that i just talked about , put it on a slippery surface , and this is what you get out of it .
and that 's a really fascinating thing about this approach .
now , when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology , we got a very good response .
and what they said was , the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen .
because stunts are obviously very dangerous , they 're very expensive , and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do , obviously , because you can 't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that 's what we 've been working on for the past few months .
and that 's our first product that we 're going to release in a couple of weeks .
so , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
that 's what people want . that 's what we 're giving them .
you can see , it 's always reacting .
this is not a dead body . this is a body who basically , in this particular case , feels the force and tries to protect its head .
only , i think it 's quite a big blow again .
you feel kind of sorry for that thing , and we 've seen it so many times now that we don 't really care any more .
there are much worse videos than this , by the way , which i have taken out , but ...
now , here 's another one .
what people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion , a strong force applied to the character , and have the character react to it in midair .
so that you don 't have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well .
so this character is going to be hit by a force , it 's going to realize it 's in the air , and it 's going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing .
that 's one angle ; here 's another angle .
we now think that the realism we 're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films .
and let 's just have a look at a slightly different visualization .
this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london , who are using our software and experimenting with it right now .
so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw , but in a slightly better rendered version .
so if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
animators had to actually animate them .
this is all happening automatically in the simulation .
this is a slightly different angle , and again a slow motion version of this .
this is incredibly quick . this is happening in real time .
you can run this simulation in real time , in front of your eyes , change it , if you want to , and you get the animation straight out of it .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
this is another behavior they requested .
i 'm not quite sure why , but we 've done it anyway .
it 's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
in this case , the character 's hands are fixed to a particular point in space , and all we 've told the character to do is to struggle .
and it looks organic . it looks realistic .
you feel kind of sorry for the guy .
it 's even worse -- and that is another video i just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .
now , i 'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel , how realistic it can look .
and this is all a physical simulation of the body , using ai to drive virtual muscles in that body .
now , one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene , and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is caught by a bungee .
got a very short clip here .
yes , you can just about see it here .
in this case , they were using a real stunt man . it was a very dangerous stunt .
it was just voted , i think in the sunday times , as one of the most impressive stunts .
now , we 've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves , " can we do that ourselves as well ? "
can we use the physical simulation of the character , use artificial intelligence , put that artificial intelligence into the character , drive virtual muscles , simulate the way he jumps off the dam , and then skydive afterwards , and have him caught by a bungee afterwards ?
we did that . it took about altogether just two hours , pretty much , to create the simulation .
and that 's what it looks like , here .
now , this could do with a bit more work . it 's still very early stages , and we pretty much just did this for a laugh , just to see what we 'd get out of it .
but what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we 're pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful .
we are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations .
there 's very often very surprising behavior that you didn 't predict before .
there 's so many things we can do with this right now .
the first thing , as i said , is going to be virtual stuntmen .
several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen , and they 're going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major productions .
the second thing is video games .
with this technology , video games will look different and they will feel very different .
for the first time , you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
i think that 's going to be incredibly exciting .
probably starting with sports games , which are going to become much more interactive .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that tom melcher has shown us .
the degree of interactivity you 're going to get is totally different , i think , from what you 're getting right now .
a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation .
we 've been approached by several simulation companies , but one project we 're particularly excited about , which we 're starting next month , is to use our technology -- and in particular , the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy , to predict the outcome of operations on these children .
as you probably know , it 's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait .
the classic quote is , i think , it 's unpredictable at best , is what people think right now , is the outcome .
now , what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool .
we 're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait , before he actually commits to an actual surgery .
that 's one project we 're particularly excited about , and that 's going to start next month .
just finally , this is only just the beginning .
we can only do several behaviors right now .
the ai isn 't good enough to simulate a full human body .
the body yes , but not all the motor skills that we have .
and , i think , we 're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing .
right now , we don 't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .
we do have one unintentional dancer actually , the last thing i 'm going to show you .
this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved , i should say -- to produce balance , basically .
so , you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter-balance .
that 's what we thought was going to come out of this .
but this is what emerged out of it , in the end .
bizarrely , this thing doesn 't have a head . i 'm not quite sure why .
so , this was not something we actually put in there .
he just started to create that dance himself .
he 's actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
and what you see after a while -- i think he even goes into a climax right at the end .
so , that all happened automatically . we didn 't put that in there .
that 's just the simulation creating this itself , basically .
so it 's just -- thanks .
not quite john travolta yet , but we 're working on that as well ,
thanks .
ca : incredible . that was really incredible .
tr : thanks .

raghava kk : shake up your story
hi everyone .
i 'm an artist and a dad -- second time around .
thank you .
and i want to share with you my latest art project .
it 's a children 's book for the ipad .
it 's a little quirky and silly .
it 's called " pop-it , " and it 's about the things little kids do with their parents .
so this is about potty training -- as most of you , i hope , know .
you can tickle the rug .
you can make the baby poop .
you can do all those fun things .
you can burst bubbles .
you can draw , as everyone should .
but you know , i have a problem with children 's books : i think they 're full of propaganda .
at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope , forget it .
it 's not the way i was brought up .
so i said , " i 'm going to counter this with my own propaganda . " if you notice carefully , it 's a homosexual couple bringing up a child .
you don 't like it ?
shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
you know , i don 't even believe in the concept of an ideal family .
i have to tell you about my childhood .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
basically , i was brought up to be a good samaritan , and i am .
and i 'd go at the end of the day to a traditional hindu house , which was probably the only hindu house in a predominantly islamic neighborhood .
basically , i celebrated every religious function .
in fact , when there was a wedding in our neighborhood , all of us would paint our houses for the wedding .
i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani .
we all had to fast during ramadan .
it was a very beautiful time .
but i must say , i 'll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
babri masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in india , built by king babur , i think , in the 16th century -- was demolished by hindu activists .
this caused major riots in my city .
and for the first time , i was affected by this communal unrest .
my little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in , and he says , " rags , rags .
you know the hindus are killing us muslims . be careful . " i 'm like , " dude , i 'm hindu . " he 's like , " huh ! " you know , my work is inspired by events such as this .
even in my gallery shows , i try and revisit historic events like babri masjid , distill only its emotional residue and image my own life .
imagine history being taught differently .
remember that children 's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?
i have another idea .
it 's a children 's book about indian independence -- very patriotic .
but when you shake it , you get pakistan 's perspective .
shake it again , and you get the british perspective .
you have to separate fact from bias , right .
even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals .
but they 're playing geopolitics .
they 're playing out israel-palestine , india-pakistan .
you know , i 'm making a very important argument .
and my argument [ is ] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
after all , children 's books are manuals on parenting , so you better give them children 's books that teach them perspectives .
and conversely , only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them .
i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
you know , i can 't promise my child a life without bias -- we 're all biased -- but i promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives .
thank you very much .

david pogue says " simplicity sells "
hello voicemail , my old friend .
i 've called for tech support again .
i ignored my boss ' warning . i called on a monday morning .
now it 's evening , and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew mold . i 'm still on hold . i 'm listening to the sounds of silence .
i don 't think you understand . i think your phone lines are unmanned .
i punched every touch tone i was told ,
but i still spent 18 hours on hold .
it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my roms ! now the mac makes the sounds of silence .
in my dreams i fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys .
say your motorcycle crashes . blood comes gushing from your gashes . with your fading strength , you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained md . but you get me . and you listen to the sounds of silence .
thank you . good evening and welcome to " spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist . " ok . when i was offered the times column six years ago , the deal was like this : you 'll be sent the coolest , hottest , slickest new gadgets .
every week it 'll arrive at your door .
you get to try them out , play with them , evaluate them until the novelty wears out , before you have to send them back .
and you 'll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
i 've always been a technology nut , and i absolutely love it .
the job , though , came with one small downside . and that is : they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .
and what i 've noticed is -- first of all , you get an incredible amount of email .
if you ever are feeling lonely , get a new york times column , because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails . and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration .
people are feeling like things -- ok , i just had an alarm come up on my screen . lucky you can 't see it .
people are feeling overwhelmed . they 're feeling like it 's too much technology too fast .
it may be good technology , but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure .
there 's not enough help . there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use .
one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support , and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website , from users saying , " me too ! " and , " here 's my tale of woe . " i call it " software rage . "
and man , let me tell you , whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh , how did that get up there ? just kidding .
ok , so why is the problem accelerating ? part of the problem is , ironically , because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use .
i 'll show you what i mean .
this is what the computer interface used to look like , dos .
over the years it 's gotten easier to use .
this is the original mac operating system .
reagan was president . madonna was still a brunette .
and the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211k .
you couldn 't put the mac os 10 logo in 211k !
so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical , broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time .
i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day .
the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .
and the calls that -- you know how they say , " your call may be recorded for quality assurance ? "
mm-mmm . your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd .
which they do .
and i have a copy .
it 's in your tedgift bag . no , no .
with your voices on it !
some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so understandable .
a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking -- making a squeaking noise .
and the technician said , " well , ma 'am , what do you mean your mouse is squeaking ? "
she says , " all i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen . " and the technician 's like , " ma 'am , you 've got the mouse up against the screen ? "
she goes , " well , the message said , ' click here to continue . ' " well , if you like that one , how much time have we got ?
another one , a guy called -- this is absolutely true ! --
his computer had crashed , and he told the technician he couldn 't restart it no matter how many times he typed 11 .
and the technician said , " what ? why are you typing 11 ? " he said , " the message says , ' error type 11 . ' " so we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users .
but why is the technical overload crisis , the complexity crisis , accelerating now ? in the hardware world , it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .
so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially staying the same size .
so it gets to be more and more of a challenge .
software is subject to another primal force : the mandate to release more and more versions .
when you buy a piece of software , it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar , where you own it .
it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year .
and every year , they say , " we 've added more features and we 'll sell it to you for $ 99 . " i know one guy who 's spent $ 4,000 just on photoshop over the years .
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
i call it the software upgrade paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times , you eventually ruin it .
i mean , microsoft word was last just a word processor in , you know , the eisenhower administration .
but what 's the alternative ? microsoft actually did this experiment . they said , " well , wait a minute . everyone complains that we 're adding so many features .
let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor .
simple , pure , does not do web pages , is not a database . "
and it came out . it was called microsoft write .
and none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died .
it tanked . no one ever bought it .
i call this the sport utility principle . people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power , right ?
they don 't need the database and the website , but they 're like , " well , i 'll upgrade , because , i might , you know , i might need that someday . "
so the problem is : as you add more features , where are they going to go ?
where are you going to stick them ? you only have so many design tools .
you can do buttons ; you can do sliders , pop-up menus , sub-menus .
but if you 're not careful about how you choose , you wind up with this .
this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word , the copy that you have , with all the toolbars open .
you 've obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
and we 've arrived at the age of interface matrices , where there are so many features and options , you have to do two dimensions , you know :
a vertical and a horizontal . you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .
the off switch is in there somewhere .
i 'm telling you , it 's there !
part of the art of designing a simple , good interface , is knowing when to use which one of these features .
here is the log off dialog box for windows 2000 .
there are only four choices ,
so why are they in a pop-up menu ?
it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices . they could have put them all out in view .
here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialog box .
thank you -- yes , i designed the dialog box . no , no , no .
already , we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design .
microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be : let 's break it down ; let 's just make it more steps . there are these " wizards " everywhere .
and you know , there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall .
if they continue at this pace , there 's absolutely no telling where they might wind up .
" welcome to the type-a-word wizard . " ok , i 'll bite . let 's click " next " to continue .
from the drop-down menu , choose the first letter you want to type . ok .
so there is a limit that we don 't want to cross . so what is the answer ?
how do you pack in all these features in a simple , intelligent way ?
i believe in consistency with possible , real-world equivalents , trashcan folder when possible , label things mostly . but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all , which is intelligence . now what do i mean by that ?
i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent , but it 's better .
if you are buying something on the web , you 're supposed to put in your address and you 're supposed to choose which country you 're from , ok ?
there are 200 countries in the world . we like to think of the internet as a global village . i 'm sorry ; it 's not one yet .
it 's mainly , like , the united states , europe and japan .
so why is united states in the " u " s ?
you have to scroll , like , seven screens-full to get to it .
now it would be inconsistent to put united states first , but it would be intelligent . this one 's been touched on before , but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called " start ? "
here 's another pet one of mine : you have a printer .
most of the time , you want to print one copy of your document , in page order , on that printer .
so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print ?
it 's like a 747 shuttle cockpit .
and one of the buttons at the bottom , you 'll notice , is not " print . "
now , i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity .
palm is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the ' 90s , and after the talk , i met one of the employees .
he says , " nice talk . " and i said , " thank you , what do you do here ? "
he said , " i 'm a tap counter . "
i 'm like , " you 're a what ? " he goes , " well , jeff hawkins , the ceo , says , ' if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus , it 's too long , and it has to be redesigned . ' so i 'm the tap counter . "
i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter .
this is microsoft word . when you want to create a new blank document in word -- it could happen !
-- you go up to the file menu and you choose " new . " now , what happens when you choose " new ? " do you get a new blank document ?
you do not .
on the opposite side of the monitor , a task bar appears , and somewhere in those links -- by the way , not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document .
that is a company not counting taps .
you know , i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft ...
audience : go on .
david pogue : yes , i do .
the bill gates song !
i 've been a geek forever and i wrote the very first dos .
i put my software and ibm together ; i got profit and they got the loss .
i write the code that makes the whole world run .
i 'm gettin ' royalties from everyone .
sometimes it 's garbage , but the press is snowed .
you buy the box ; i 'll sell the code .
every software company is doing microsoft 's r & d .
you can 't keep a good idea down these days .
even windows is a hack . we 're kind of based loosely on the mac .
so it 's big , so it 's slow . you 've got nowhere to go . i 'm not doing this for praise . i write the code that fits the world today .
big mediocrity in every way . we 've entered planet domination mode . you 'll have no choice ; you 'll buy my code .
i am bill gates and i write the code .
but actually , i believe there are really two microsofts .
there 's the old one , responsible for windows and office .
they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can 't . they 're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good , simple interface designs .
i liked the media center pc . i liked the microsoft spot watch .
the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market , but it wasn 't because it wasn 't simply and beautifully designed .
let 's put it this way : would you pay $ 10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night , like your cell phone , and stops working when you leave your area code ?
the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse .
so is there any hope ? the screens are getting smaller .
people are illuminating , putting manuals in the boxes .
the things are coming out at a faster pace .
it 's funny -- when steve jobs came back to apple in 1997 , after 12 years away , it was the macworld expo --
he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans , and he sort of did this . the crowd went wild , but i 'm like , where have i seen this before ? i had just seen the movie " evita " -- -- with madonna , and i 'm like , you know what , i 've got to do one about steve jobs .
it won 't be easy . you 'll think i 'm strange .
when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black .
you won 't believe me .
all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz .
you try rhyming with garage !
don 't cry for me , cupertino .
the truth is , i never left you .
i know the ropes now , know what the tricks are .
i made a fortune over at pixar .
don 't cry for me , cupertino . i 've still got the drive and vision . i still wear sandals in any weather . it 's just that these days , they 're gucci leather .
thank you . so steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty . and the truth is , for years i was a little depressed -- because americans obviously did not value it , because the mac had three percent market share and windows had 95 percent market share .
people did not think it was worth putting a price on it .
so i was a little depressed -- then i heard al gore 's talk , and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed .
but it turns out i was wrong , right ? because the ipod came out , and it violated every bit of common wisdom .
other products cost less . other products had more features .
they had voice recorders and fm transmitters .
the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard , not apple 's propriety standard .
but the ipod won ! this is the one they wanted .
the lesson was : simplicity sells .
and there are signs that the industry is getting the message .
this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance .
the sonos thing -- it 's catching on .
i 've got just a couple examples . physically , a really cool , elegant , thinking coming along lately .
when you have a digital camera , how do you get the pictures back to your computer ?
well , you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around .
either one , you 're going to lose . what i do is , i take out the memory card , and i fold it in half , revealing usb contacts .
i just stick it in the computer , offload the pictures , put it right back in the camera . i never have to lose anything .
here 's another example . chris , you 're the source of all power .
will you be my power plug ?
chris anderson : oh yeah .
dp : hold that and don 't let go . you might have seen this : this is apple 's new laptop . this is the power cord . it hooks on like this .
and i 'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives , or one of your children . you walk along -- and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor . i don 't care . it 's a loaner .
here we go . whoa ! it 's magnetic . it doesn 't pull the laptop onto the floor .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
" speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly . period .
like , i get hundreds of them a day . period .
and it 's not just what i dictate that it writes down . period .
i also use this feature called voice macros . period . "
correct " dissuade . " " not just . "
okay , this is not an ideal situation , because it 's getting the echo from the hall and stuff .
but the point is : i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing . so if somebody sends me a fan letter , i 'll say , " thanks for that . "
and conversely , if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , " piss off . "
so that 's my dirty little secret . don 't tell anyone .
so the point is , this a really interesting story .
this is version eight of this software , and do you know what they put in version eight ?
no new features . it 's never happened before in software !
the company put no new features . they just said , " we 'll make the software work right . " right .
because for years people had bought this software , tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got , which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they put it in their drawer . and the company got sick of that , so they said , " this version , we 're not going to do anything but make sure it 's darned accurate . "
and so that 's what they did . this cult of doing things right is starting to spread .
my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology : remember , if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you , ok ?
it could be the design of the thing you 're using .
be aware in life of good design and bad design .
and if you 're among the people who create the stuff , easy is hard .
pre-sweat the details for your audience . count the taps .
remember , the hard part is not deciding what features to add -- it 's deciding what to leave out .
and best of all , your motivation is : simplicity sells .
ca : bravo . dp : thank you very much .
ca : hear , hear !
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / bill _ joy _ muses _ on _ what _ s _ next.html
technologist and futurist bill joy talks about several big worries for humanity -- and several big hopes in the fields of health , education and future tech .
business , future , health , science , technology
405
bill joy : what i 'm worried about , what i 'm excited about
what technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty ?
and what i found was quite surprising .
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they 'd been improved , and very simple things turned out .
you 'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water , but it 's actually the opposite .
and so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then-early web -- would clearly make a huge difference to that problem .
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for abuse .
if you think about it , in history , a long , long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual .
we came up with something -- the ten commandments : thou shalt not kill .
that 's a , kind of a one-on-one thing .
we organized into cities . we had many people .
and to keep the many from tyrannizing the one , we came up with concepts like individual liberty .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .
but now we have a new situation , really what people call an asymmetric situation , where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation-state .
it 's not the nation-states that have potential access to mass destruction , but individuals .
and this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital .
we saw genome sequences .
you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to , and clearly someone recently -- i saw in a science magazine -- they said , well , the 1918 flu is too dangerous to fedex around .
if people want to use it in their labs for working on research , just reconstruct it yourself , because , you know , it might break in fedex .
so that this is possible to do this is not deniable .
so individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these kinds of self-replicating technologies , whether it be biological or other , are clearly a danger in our world .
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what 's a pandemic .
and we really don 't have experience with pandemics ,
and we 're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don 't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with .
so it 's not in our nature to pre-act .
and in this case , piling on more technology doesn 't solve the problem , because it only super-empowers people more .
so the solution has to be , as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form , i think , early in the 20th century , that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart .
you know , public policy and moral progress .
the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and so to limit the danger of these new things , we have to limit , ultimately , the ability of individuals to have access , essentially , to pandemic power .
we also have to have sensible defense , because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
so these are the kind of thoughts i was thinking in 1999 and 2000 , and my friends told me i was getting really depressed , and they were really worried about me .
and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the plague , and you know , nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle , and so on .
and then i was there on september 11th , and i stood in the streets with everyone .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
i got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were parked on houston street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away .
and i walked down the middle , up to the train station , and everything below 14th street was closed .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , i suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
it was always a surprise that it happened then and there , but it wasn 't a surprise that it happened at all .
and everyone then started writing about this .
thousands of people started writing about this .
and i eventually abandoned the book , and then chris called me to talk at the conference . i really don 't talk about this anymore because , you know , there 's enough frustrating and depressing things going on .
but i agreed to come and say a few things about this .
and i would say that we can 't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that 's to give up the thing that makes civilization .
and we can 't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we 're doing , because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage , causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably , probably almost certainly , has made the problem worse .
so we can 't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost , one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio .
so after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago ,
and to work through venture capital on the innovative side , and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .
things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome .
i 've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk .
it 's overwhelming at times . i 'm very thankful for google and wikipedia so i can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i 'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
the first is this whole area of education , and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ 100 computer .
and that is to say that there 's a lot of legs left in moore 's law .
the most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers , and we 've seen , and i 've had the pleasure to invest in , companies that give me great confidence that we 'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale .
another factor of , say , six in dimensional reduction , which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement in what the chips can do . and so , to put that in practical terms , if something costs about 1,000 dollars today , say , the best personal computer you can buy , that might be its cost , i think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars . okay ?
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
i think the challenge for us is -- i 'm very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
i 'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers , but we don 't have very good software for them .
and it 's only in retrospect , after the better software comes along , and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine , you say , god , the machine was that fast ?
i remember when they took the apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii .
the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface , we just didn 't know how to do it at the time .
so given that we know and should believe -- because moore 's law 's been , like , a constant , i mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
it 's great that we have initiatives to say , let 's go create the education and educate people in the world , because that 's a great force for peace .
and we can give everyone in the world a $ 100 computer or a $ 10 computer in the next 15 years .
the second area that i 'm focusing on is the environmental problem , because that 's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world .
we 'll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly .
the thing that we see as the kind of moore 's law trend that 's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials .
we have a challenge , because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time . people are moving to the cities .
they all need clean water , they need energy , they need transportation , and we want them to develop in a green way .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
we 've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency , but the consumer sector , especially in america , is very inefficient .
but these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there 's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market .
and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago .
if we take carbon nanotubes , you know , iijima discovered them in 1991 , they just have incredible properties .
and these are the kinds of things we 're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .
their strength : they 're almost the strongest material , tensile strength material known .
they 're very , very stiff . they stretch very , very little .
in two dimensions , if you make , like , a fabric out of them , they 're 30 times stronger than kevlar .
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a buckyball , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them , they repair themselves ; they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds , which is not -- is really quick .
if you shine a light on them , they produce electricity .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
if you put electricity on them , they emit light .
if you run current through them , you can run 1,000 times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal .
you can make both p- and n-type semiconductors , which means you can make transistors out of them .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
if you put particles in them , and they go shooting out the tip -- they 're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns .
the inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it 's basically a quantum world .
it 's a strange place inside a nanotube .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things lisa randall 's talking about are in there .
i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial .
so inside of a nanotube , we 're really at the limit here .
so what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties -- lighter , stronger -- and apply these new materials to the environmental problems .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that catalyze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
new ways of making electric transportation .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profitable .
and we 've dedicated -- we 've just raised a new fund , we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments .
we believe that genentech , the compaq , the lotus , the sun , the netscape , the amazon , the google in these fields are yet to be found , because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in new york .
we raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense .
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund , so this for us is a very substantial fund .
and what we did , over the last few months -- well , a few months ago , ray kurzweil and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous .
and john doerr and brook and others got concerned , [ unclear ] , and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic . and we saw a lot of gaps .
and so we asked ourselves , you know , can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps ? and brooks told me in a break here , he said he 's found so much stuff he can 't sleep ,
because there 's so many great technologies out there , we 're essentially buried . and we need them , you know .
we have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works , roughly . that 's tamiflu .
but tamiflu -- the virus is resistant . it is resistant to tamiflu .
we 've discovered with aids we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals .
we need better surveillance .
we need networks that can find out what 's going on .
we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
we need new anti-virals and cocktails . we need new kinds of vaccines .
vaccines that are broad spectrum .
vaccines that we can manufacture quickly .
cocktails , more polyvalent vaccines .
you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .
we need -- we don 't know where this thing is going .
we believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps , we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .
and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact .
so we 're very excited because we think we can fund 10 , or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .
so if we can address , use technology , help address education , help address the environment , help address the pandemic , does that solve the larger problem that i was talking about in the wired article ? and i 'm afraid the answer is really no ,
because you can 't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology .
if we let an unlimited amount of power loose , then we will -- a very small number of people will be able to abuse it .
we can 't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage .
so what we need to do is , we need better policy .
and for example , some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets .
markets are a very strong force .
for example , rather than trying to regulate away problems , which probably won 't work , if we could price into the cost of doing business , the cost of catastrophe , so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk .
so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on .
but it wouldn 't have to be approved by regulators ; you 'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
how could you keep the law ?
i think the law would be a really good thing to keep .
well , you have to hold people accountable .
the law requires accountability .
today scientists , technologists , businessmen , engineers don 't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions .
so if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law .
and finally , i think we have to do something that 's not really -- it 's almost unacceptable to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
we can 't pick the future , but we can steer the future .
our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes .
we may not be able to stop it , but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem .
so we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen , and steer us to a lower-risk place .
vice president gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
and growing up as we have , and holding very high the value of free speech , this is a hard thing for us to accept -- for all of us to accept .
it 's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember , you know , galileo essentially locked up , and who are still fighting this battle against the church .
but that 's the price of having a civilization .
the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power .
thank you .

so the mars rovers didn 't scoop up any alien lifeforms . scientist penelope boston thinks there 's a good chance -- a 25 to 50 percent chance , in fact -- that life might exist on mars , deep inside the planet 's caves . she details how we should look and why .

penelope boston says there might be life on mars
the career that i started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places , and at that time i was working in the antarctic and the arctic , and high deserts and low deserts .
until about a dozen years ago , when i was really captured by caves , and i really re-focused most of my research in that direction .
so i have a really cool day job-- i get to do some really amazing stuff .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they 're absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet .
apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there , we 're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .
particularly mars , but also europa , the small , icy moon around jupiter .
and perhaps , someday , far beyond our solar system itself .
i 'm very passionately interested in the human future , on the moon and mars particularly , and elsewhere in the solar system .
i think it 's time that we transitioned to a solar system-going civilization and species .
and , as an outgrowth of all of this then , i wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transporting earth-type life to other planets .
notably mars , as a first example .
something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
why don 't i have a normal job , a sensible job ?
and then of course , i blame the soviet union .
because in the mid-1950s , when i was a tiny child , they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called sputnik , which sent the western world into a hysterical tailspin .
and a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids .
and i 'm a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
it really caught hold of us , and caught fire , and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now .
of course , refusing to grow up -- -- even though i impersonate a grown-up in daily life , but i do a fairly good job of that -- but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you 're interested in , is really critical .
the next element is the fact that i have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life .
and so , life is more valuable than no life .
and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
i 'm very interested in mars , of course , and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the viking landers landed on mars .
and that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky , that you would see as a dot , and turned it completely into a landscape , as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen .
and when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
in my graduate years i worked with my colleague and mentor and friend , steve schneider , at the national center for atmospheric research , working on global change issues .
we 've written a number of things on the role of gaia hypothesis -- whether or not you could consider earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense , and then , as an outgrowth of that , i worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
but what it taught me was to look at earth as a planet with external eyes , not just as our home .
and that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective , to try to then think about the way our planet behaves , as a planet , and with the life that 's on it .
and all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history .
we 're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .
so , back to mars .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
well , sometimes it 's really very hard for us to find each other , even on this planet .
so , finding life on another planet is a non-trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that .
whether or not you think it 's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe .
i think , myself , that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .
so , you start with the big bang and you get hydrogen , and then you get helium , and then you get more complicated stuff , and you get planets forming -- and life is a common , planetary-based phenomenon , in my view .
certainly , in the last 15 years , we 've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed ,
and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the size-class of earth has actually been found .
and so this is very exciting news .
so , my first bold prediction is that , is that in the universe , life is going to be everywhere .
it 's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .
and those planetary systems are going to be very common .
so , what about life on mars ?
well , if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what i thought the chances of life on mars would be , i would 've probably said , a couple of percent .
and even that was considered outrageous at the time .
i was once sneeringly introduced by a former nasa official , as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on mars .
of course , that official is now dead , and i 'm not , so there 's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries .
but things have changed greatly over the last dozen years .
and the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information .
the amazing pathfinder mission that went in ' 97 , and the mer rover missions that are on mars as we speak now and the european space agency 's mars express , has taught us a number of amazing things .
there is sub-surface ice on that planet .
and so where there is water , there is a very high chance of our kind of life .
there 's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place - one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed , and there are these amazing structures called blueberries , which are these little , rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now .
so , with all of these things put together , i think that the chances of life are much greater than i would 've ever thought .
i think that the chance of life having arisen on mars , sometime in its past , is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half .
so this is a very bold statement .
i think it 's there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it 's underground .
so the game 's afoot , and this is the game that we play in astro-biology .
how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
how do you plan to look for it ?
how do you know it when you find it ?
because if it 's big and obvious , we would 've already found it -- it would 've already bitten us on the foot , and it hasn 't .
so , we know that it 's probably quite cryptic .
very critically , how do we protect it , if we find it , and not contaminate it ?
and also , even perhaps more critically , because this is the only home planet we have , how do we protect us from it , while we study it ?
so why might it be hard to find ?
well , it 's probably microscopic , and it 's never easy to study microscopic things , although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth , at much smaller scales than ever before .
but it 's probably hiding , because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment , that makes you yummy , and other things might want to eat you , or consume you .
and so , there 's a game of predator-prey that 's going to be , essentially , universal , really , in any kind of biological system .
it also may be very , very different in its fundamental properties - its chemistry , or its size .
we say small , but what does that mean ?
is it virus-sized ? is it smaller than that ?
is it bigger than the biggest bacterium ? we don 't know .
and speed of activity , which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms , because they grow very , very slowly .
if i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate , within about four or five hours , i would have to see growth .
but the organisms that we work with , from the sub-surface of earth , very often it 's months -- and in many cases , years -- before we see any growth whatsoever .
so they are , intrinsically , a slower life-form .
but the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience , and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know , then we can 't recognize what to look for , or how to plan for it .
so , perspective is everything and , because of the history that i 've just briefly talked to you about , i have learned to think about earth as an extraterrestrial planet .
and this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things .
this is my favorite game on airplanes : where you 're in an airplane and you look out the window , you see the horizon .
i always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
it 's a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i 'm sitting in a window seat .
well , this is what we apply to our work .
this shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in .
this is cueva de villa luz in tabasco , in mexico , and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid .
there is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite -- minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed -- and it is a completely hostile environment for us .
we have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear , and 30 parts per million of h2s will kill you .
this is regularly several hundred parts per million .
so , it 's a very hazardous environment , with co as well , and many other gases .
these extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special .
because contrary to what you might think , this is not devoid of life .
this is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet , anywhere .
it 's bursting with life .
the extremes on earth are interesting in their own right , but one of the reasons that we 're interested in them is because they represent , really , the average conditions that we may expect on other planets .
so , this is part of the ability that we have , to try to stretch our imagination , in terms of what we may find in the future .
there 's so much life in this cave , and i can 't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you .
but one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call snottites , for obvious reasons .
this stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old 's nose when he has a cold .
and this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid , and living at phs right around zero .
and so , this stuff is like battery acid .
and yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
in fact , there 's so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there 's actually a huge number of cavefish .
and the local zoque indians harvest this twice a year , as part of their easter week celebration and holy week celebration .
this is very unusual for caves .
in some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in lechuguilla cave in new mexico near carlsbad , and this is one of the most famous caves in the world .
it 's 115 miles of mapped passage , it 's pristine , it has no natural opening and it 's a gigantic biological , geo-microbiological laboratory .
in this cave , great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here , and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down .
this stuff is produced biologically .
this is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through .
they take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them .
and every time they do that , they get a tiny little packet of energy .
and that tiny little packet of energy is what they use , then , to run their life processes .
interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals .
and so , the obvious avenue for bio-remediation comes from organisms like this .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on petri plates , and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .
so , these are signals that they leave in the rock record .
well , even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves , which are a by-product of volcanic activity , we find these walls totally covered , in many cases , by these beautiful , glistening silver walls , or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold .
and these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys -- these are gardens of these bacteria .
one of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they 're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria , which is where we get most of our antibiotics .
the sub-surface of earth contains a vast biodiversity .
and these organisms , because they 're very separate from the surface , make a vast array of novel compounds .
and so , the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped , but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet .
so , lava-tube caves-- i 've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
we can see them .
on the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption -- mount etna in sicily -- and this is the way these tubes form .
and when they hollow out , then they become habitats for organisms .
these are all over the planet mars , and we 're busy cataloguing them now .
and so , there 's very interesting cave real estate on mars , at least of that type .
in order to access these sub-surface environments that we 're interested in , we 're very interested in developing the tools to do this .
you know , it 's not easy to get into these caves . it requires crawling , climbing , rope-work , technical rope-work and many other complex human motions in order to access these .
we face the problem of , how can we do this robotically ?
why would we want to do it robotically ?
well , we 're going to be sending robotic missions to mars long in advance of human missions .
and then , secondly , getting back to that earlier point that i made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on mars , we don 't want to contaminate it .
and one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary .
and in this case , we 're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front-end work for us , to protect any potential life that we find .
i 'm not going to go through all of these projects now , but we 're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects , in collaboration with a number of different groups .
i want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top .
these are hopping microbot swarms .
i 'm working on this with the field and space robotics laboratory and my friend steve dubowsky at mit , and we have come up with the idea of having little , jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle , which is one of the dubowsky lab 's specialties -- are the epams , or artificial muscles .
and these allow them to hop .
they behave with a swarm behavior , where they relate to each other , modeled after insect swarm behavior , and they could be made very numerous .
and so , one can send a thousand of them , as you can see in this upper left-hand picture , a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers .
and these little guys -- you could lose many of them .
if you send a thousand of them , you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission .
and so , that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go .
now , to wrap this up , i want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
it occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past .
and perhaps it 's time we started to explore those , in the context of future mars and the moon exploration .
so , we have just finished a nasa institute for advanced concepts phase ii study , looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the moon or mars .
it turns out to be a fairly simple and small list , and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction .
so , we 're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies .
and the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on mars .
and right now we 're in caves , and we 're doing science and recreation , but i think in the future we 'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies .
now , my view of what the current status of potential life on mars is that it 's probably been on the planet , maybe one in two chances .
the question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied , because we now know , from mars meteorites that have made it to earth , that there 's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
did life start here and was it transported there ?
did it start there and get transported here ?
this will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century , and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions .
thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / derek _ sivers _ keep _ your _ goals _ to _ yourself.html
after hitting on a brilliant new life plan , our first instinct is to tell someone , but derek sivers says it 's better to keep goals secret . he presents research stretching as far back as the 1920s to show why people who talk about their ambitions may be less likely to achieve them .

derek sivers : keep your goals to yourself
everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
for real -- you can take a second . you 've got to feel this to learn it .
take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal , okay ?
imagine deciding right now that you 're going to do it .
imagine telling someone that you meet today what you 're going to do .
imagine their congratulations and their high image of you .
doesn 't it feel good to say it out loud ?
don 't you feel one step closer already , like it 's already becoming part of your identity ?
well , bad news : you should have kept your mouth shut , because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it .
repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen .
any time you have a goal , there are some steps that need to be done , some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it .
ideally , you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work . but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it 's called a " social reality . "
the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it 's already done .
and then , because you felt that satisfaction , you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
so , let 's look at the proof .
1926 , kurt lewin , founder of social psychology , called this " substitution . "
1933 , vera mahler found , when it was acknowledged by others , it felt real in the mind .
1982 , peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 , he did some new tests that were published .
it goes like this : 163 people across four separate tests -- everyone wrote down their personal goal . then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room , and half didn 't .
then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal , but they were told that they could stop at any time .
now , those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes , on average ,
and when asked afterwards , said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal .
but those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes , on average ,
and when asked afterwards , said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal .
so , if this is true , what can we do ?
well , you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .
you can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings ,
and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing .
but if you do need to talk about something , you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction , such as , " i really want to run this marathon , so i need to train five times a week and kick my ass if i don 't , okay ? "
so audience , next time you 're tempted to tell someone your goal , what will you say ?
exactly , well done .

benjamin wallace on the price of happiness
i 'm just going to play a brief video clip .
video :
on the fifth of december 1985 , a bottle of 1787 lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record .
the buyer was kip forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century .
the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century .
chateau lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar . benjamin wallace : now , that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world .
and the mystery existed because of a gentleman named hardy rodenstock .
in 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery .
some workmen in paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of thomas jefferson . 1787 , 1784 .
he wouldn 't reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .
the mystery persisted for about 20 years .
it finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy .
bill koch is a florida billionaire who owns four of the jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious .
and he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .
there 's now ample evidence that hardy rodenstock is a con man , and that the jefferson bottles were fakes .
but for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles .
i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world .
i became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of
you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
so , i decided to embark on a quest .
with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes , i decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine .
this was the first one .
a lot of the kobe beef that you see in the u.s. is not the real thing .
it may come from wagyu cattle , but it 's not from the original , appalachian hyogo prefecture in japan .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real kobe , and one of them is wolfgang puck 's restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
i went there , and i ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
and i was outraged .
it was like , 160 dollars for this ?
and then i took a bite , and i wished that it was tinier , because kobe beef is so rich .
it 's like foie gras -- it 's not even like steak .
i almost couldn 't finish it .
i was really happy when i was done .
now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character . which , i guess , you know , communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the price .
white truffles .
one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world .
to try this , i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan -- del posto .
the waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , " would signore like the truffles ? "
and the charm of white truffles is in their aroma .
it 's not in their taste , really . it 's not in their texture .
it 's in the smell .
these white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served ,
and so i 'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .
there were several -- several of these items were disappointments .
yeah .
the magazine wouldn 't pay for me to go there .
they did give me a tour , though .
and this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
it has 360-degree views .
it has four balconies .
it was designed by the architect i.m. pei .
it comes with its own rolls royce and driver .
it comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from .
when i took the tour , it actually included some opus one , i was glad to see .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
this is soap that 's made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties .
i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this .
and it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .
but then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans i 'm wearing .
these ones gq did spring for -- i own these -- but i will tell you , not only did i not get a compliment from any of you , i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these .
i don 't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value , but i think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that 's a reasonable benchmark .
that said , a lot of work goes into these .
they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
but no compliments .
thank you .
armando manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in tuscany .
and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light .
he uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas .
and he actually -- once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .
it tasted fine . it tasted interesting .
it was very green , it was very peppery .
but in the blind taste test , it came in last .
the olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of whole foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months .
a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan -- you 'll start to notice .
i don 't play golf , so i couldn 't actually road test these , but i did interview a guy who owns them .
even the people who market these clubs -- i mean , they 'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they 'll say , look , you know , you 're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs .
you 're paying for the bling , that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum .
the guy who i interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ...
oh , yeah , you know this one ?
this is a coffee made from a very unusual process .
the luwak is an asian palm civet .
it 's a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations .
and apparently it 's a very picky eater and it , you know , hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries .
and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats ' leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .
that 's right .
unrelatedly --
japan is doing crazy things with toilets .
there is now a toilet that has an mp3 player in it .
there 's one with a fragrance dispenser .
there 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor .
it 's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that japanese toilet technology is heading in .
this one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best -- the neorest 600 .
and to try this -- i couldn 't get a loaner , but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which i used .
it 's fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts .
the seat is preheated .
there 's a water jet that cleans you .
there 's an air jet that dries you .
you get up , it flushes by itself .
the lid closes , it self-cleans .
not only is it a technological leap forward , but i really do believe it 's a bit of a cultural leap forward .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
and i want to get one of these .
this was another one i could not get a loaner of .
tom cruise supposedly owns this bed .
there 's a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it .
to try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom .
lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things .
but anyway , we had a great night 's sleep .
and you spend a third of your life in bed .
i don 't think it 's that bad of a deal .
this was a fun one .
this is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car .
i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of los angeles and down on the pacific coast highway .
and , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods .
and it was really amazing .
it was such a smooth ride .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rattle .
i switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , " you know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . "
and i had no idea that i was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth .
and if i was a billionaire , i would get one .
this is a completely gratuitous video i 'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology .
this is tom cruise arriving at the " mission : impossible iii " premiere .
when he tries to open the door , you could call it " mission : impossible iv . "
there was one object that i could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .
the ' 47 cheval blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century .
and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape .
and 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of bordeaux .
and just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following .
but it 's 60 years old .
there 's not much of it left .
what there is of it left you don 't know if it 's real -- it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world .
not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist .
so , i 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these .
i 'd put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty .
and then i got an email from a guy named bipin desai .
bipin desai is a u.c. riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings ,
and he said , " i 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' 47 cheval blanc . "
and it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of cheval blanc , and 30 vintages of yquem .
and it was an invitation you do not refuse .
i went .
it was three days , four meals .
and at lunch on saturday , we opened the ' 47 .
and you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil .
and then i tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways .
there were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
and i wasn 't that impressed .
and i don 't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn 't necessarily mean something that i wasn 't impressed , but i was not the only one there who had that reaction .
and it wasn 't just to that wine .
any one of the wines served at this tasting , if i 'd been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable .
but drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience .
and i just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at stanford and caltech .
and they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags .
a lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more --
it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive .
but what was unexpected was that these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag .
thank you .

we 're bringing gameplay into more aspects of our lives , spending countless hours -- and real money -- exploring virtual worlds for imaginary treasures . why ? as tom chatfield shows , games are perfectly tuned to dole out rewards that engage the brain and keep us questing for more .

tom chatfield : 7 ways games reward the brain
i love video games .
i 'm also slightly in awe of them .
i 'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination , in terms of technology , in terms of concept .
but i think , above all , i 'm in awe at their power to motivate , to compel us , to transfix us , like really nothing else we 've ever invented has quite done before .
and i think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media .
from about 10 billion in 1990 , it 's worth 50 billion dollars globally today , and it shows no sign of slowing down .
in four years ' time , it 's estimated it 'll be worth over 80 billion dollars .
that 's about three times the recorded music industry .
this is pretty stunning , but i don 't think it 's the most telling statistic of all .
the thing that really amazes me is that , today , people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games .
this is a screenshot from the virtual game world , entropia universe .
earlier this year , a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330,000 real dollars .
and this is a titan class ship in the space game , eve online .
and this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build , plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that .
and yet , many of these get built .
at the other end of the scale , the game farmville that you may well have heard of , has 70 million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day .
this may all sound really quite alarming to some people , an index of something worrying or wrong in society .
but we 're here for the good news , and the good news is that i think we can explore why this very real human effort , this very intense generation of value , is occurring .
and by answering that question , i think we can take something extremely powerful away .
and i think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards .
and specifically , it 's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively .
now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
on the one hand , there 's the wanting processes .
this is a bit like ambition and drive -- i 'm going to do that . i 'm going to work hard .
on the other hand , there 's the liking processes , fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back .
it 's a really great image . it 's pretty cool .
it 's from the game world of warcraft with more than 10 million players globally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
and this kind of a world , this vast flying beast you can ride around , shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking .
because it 's very powerful . it 's pretty awesome .
it gives you great powers .
your ambition is satisfied , but it 's very beautiful .
it 's a very great pleasure to fly around .
and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .
but this isn 't the really interesting stuff .
the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .
because what you can measure in virtuality is everything .
every single thing that every single person who 's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured .
the biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players , about what everybody does -- far more detail than you 'd ever get from any website .
and this allows something very special to happen in games .
it 's something called the reward schedule .
and by this , i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate , the nature , the type , the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort .
now , to try and explain this in sort of real terms , i want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games .
go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item .
let 's say , for the sake of argument , my mission is to get 15 pies and i can get 15 pies by killing these cute , little monsters .
simple game quest .
now you can think about this , if you like , as a problem about boxes .
i 've got to keep opening boxes . i don 't know what 's inside them until i open them .
and i go around opening box after box until i 've got 15 pies .
now , if you take a game like warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box-opening effort .
the game 's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes , getting better and better stuff in them .
this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
let 's think about probability .
if we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies , we want to make sure it 's neither too easy , nor too difficult , to find a pie .
so what do you do ? well , you look at a million people -- no , 100 million people , 100 million box openers -- and you work out , if you make the pie rate about 25 percent -- that 's neither too frustrating , nor too easy . it keeps people engaged . but of course , that 's not all you do -- there 's 15 pies .
now , i could make a game called piecraft , where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies .
that would be very boring .
fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
you find that -- you know , between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going .
but we don 't just have pies in the boxes .
there 's 100 percent up here .
and what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened , there 's something in it , some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged .
in most adventure games , it 's a little bit in-game currency , a little bit experience . but we don 't just do that either .
we also say there 's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement .
there 's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item .
there 's going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item .
and each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item .
and also , we say , " well , how many monsters ? should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ? "
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time .
so i 'm drawn on . it 's not too easy , not too difficult .
so all this is very powerful .
but we 're in virtuality . these aren 't real boxes .
so we can do some rather amazing things .
we notice , looking at all these people opening boxes , that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies , their perception shifts , they start to get a bit bored , a bit testy .
they 're not rational about probability .
they think this game is unfair .
it 's not giving me my last two pies . i 'm going to give up .
if they 're real boxes , there 's not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , " right , well .
when you get to 13 pies , you 've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now . "
keep you engaged . look at what people do -- adjust the world to match their expectation .
our games don 't always do this .
and one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item , they make very sure another one doesn 't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value , to keep it special .
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .
over tens and hundreds of thousands of years , we evolved to find certain things stimulating , and as very intelligent , civilized beings , we 're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning .
but now , we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes .
so what does all this mean in practice ?
well , i 've come up with seven things that , i think , show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games .
the first one is very simple : experience bars measuring progress -- something that 's been talked about brilliantly by people like jesse schell earlier this year .
it 's already been done at the university of indiana in the states , among other places .
it 's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces , you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny , tiny , tiny little increments which they feel are their own .
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it creeping up , and they own that as it goes along .
second , multiple long and short-term aims -- 5,000 pies , boring , 15 pies , interesting .
so , you give people lots and lots of different tasks .
you say , it 's about doing 10 of these questions , but another task is turning up to 20 classes on time , but another task is collaborating with other people , another task is showing you 're working five times , another task is hitting this particular target .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
third , you reward effort .
it 's your 100 percent factor . games are brilliant at this .
every time you do something , you get credit ; you get a credit for trying .
you don 't punish failure . you reward every little bit of effort -- a little bit of gold , a little bit of credit . you 've done 20 questions -- tick .
it all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
fourth , feedback .
this is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this .
if you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we 've been hearing amazing things about , it 's very , very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions .
pollution , global warming , these things -- the consequences are distant in time and space .
it 's very hard to learn , to feel a lesson . but if you can model things for people , if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes , then they can learn a lesson , they can see , they can move on , they can understand .
and fifth , the element of uncertainty .
now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn 't quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
and if you think about using this in testing , in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training , you can transform the levels of people 's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism . when we don 't quite predict something perfectly , we get really excited about it .
we just want to go back and find out more .
as you probably know , the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine .
it 's associated with reward-seeking behavior .
and something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the u.k. , where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
and two things really flow from this .
the first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments .
when someone is more likely to remember , we can give them a nugget in a window .
and the second thing is confidence , that we can see how game-playing and reward structures make people braver , make them more willing to take risks , more willing to take on difficulty , harder to discourage . this can all seem very sinister .
but you know , sort of " our brains have been manipulated ; we 're all addicts . "
the word " addiction " is thrown around .
there are real concerns there .
but the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people .
this is what really excites us .
in reward terms , it 's not money ; it 's not being given cash -- that 's nice -- it 's doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
and i want to tell you a quick story about 1999 -- a video game called everquest .
and in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them -- 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
that 's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items .
so players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other , fairly and transparently .
what happened was , they paid each other a virtual currency they called " dragon kill points . "
and every time you turned up to go on a mission , you got paid in dragon kill points .
they tracked these on a separate website .
so they tracked their own private currency , and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted -- all organized by the players themselves .
now the staggering system , not just that this worked in everquest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system -- tens of millions of people .
and the success rate is at close to 100 percent .
this is a player-developed , self-enforcing , voluntary currency , and it 's incredibly sophisticated player behavior .
and i just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world .
let 's start with business .
i mean , we 're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation .
we 're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters .
and i just look at this , and i think , yes , we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets , by using elements of uncertainty , by using these multiple targets , by using a grand , underlying reward and incentive system , by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups , in terms of streets to collaborate and compete , to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see .
in terms of education , perhaps most obviously of all , we can transform how we engage people .
we can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment .
we can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks .
we can use calculated randomness .
we can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
and we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms .
government , well , one thing that comes to mind is the u.s. government , among others , is literally starting to pay people to lose weight .
so we 're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity .
but again , those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal , to take the data , to take the observations , of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement .
and in the end , it 's this word , " engagement , " that i want to leave you with .
it 's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games .
but it 's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games .
and if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards , then i really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands .
thank you very much .

co-creator of the philanthropic feed bags , ellen gustafson says hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin . at tedxeast , she launches the 30 project -- a way to change how we farm and eat in the next 30 years , and solve the global food inequalities behind both epidemics .

ellen gustafson : obesity + hunger = 1 global food issue
i 'm ellen , and i 'm totally obsessed with food .
but i didn 't start out obsessed with food .
i started out obsessed with global security policy because i lived in new york during 9 / 11 , and it was obviously a very relevant thing .
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i 'm hungry , i 'm really pissed off ,
and i 'm assuming that the rest of the world is too .
especially if you 're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor 's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry , you 're pretty angry .
and actually , lo and behold , it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
and while i was there , i came across what i think is the most brilliant of their programs .
it 's called school feeding , and it 's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world , and stop it .
by giving kids a free school meal , it gets them into school , which is obviously education , the first step out of poverty ,
but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically .
while i was working at the u.n. , i met this girl . her name is lauren bush .
and she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the " feed bag " -- which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag .
but each bag we 'd sell would provide a year 's worth of school meals for one kid .
it 's so simple , and we thought , you know , okay , it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year .
we could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the world food programme .
but of course , you know at the u.n. , sometimes things move slowly , and they basically said no .
and we thought , god , this is such a good idea and it 's going to raise so much money .
so we said screw it , we 'll just start our own company , which we did three years ago .
so that was kind of my first dream , was to start this company called feed ,
and here 's a screenshot of our website .
we did this bag for haiti , and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in haiti .
so feed 's doing great . we 've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world by selling now 550,000 bags , a ton of bags , a lot of bags .
all this time you 're -- when you think about hunger , it 's a hard thing to think about , because what we think about is eating .
i think about eating a lot , and i really love it .
and the thing that 's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know : " what are you doing in america ? "
" what are you doing for america 's kids ? "
there 's definitely hunger in america : 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children .
i mean that 's pretty dramatic for our own country .
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally , but it 's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .
but obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity , and it 's dramatic .
the other thing that 's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years .
unfortunately , obesity 's not only an american problem .
it 's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we 're exporting .
the numbers are pretty crazy .
there 's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry .
so those seem like two bifurcated problems , but i kind of started to think about , you know , what is obesity and hunger ? what are both those things about ?
well , they 're both about food .
and when you think about food , the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture .
and agriculture is where food comes from .
well , agriculture in america 's very interesting .
it 's very consolidated ,
and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat .
well , the foods that are produced are , more or less , corn , soy and wheat .
and as you can see , that 's three-quarters of the food that we 're eating for the most part : processed foods and fast foods .
unfortunately , in our agricultural system , we haven 't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world .
so african agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen .
so somehow we 're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world .
who is farming them ? that 's what i was wondering .
so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the midwest ,
and that really didn 't help me understand farming , but i think it 's a really cool picture .
and you know , the reality is that between farmers in america , who actually , quite frankly , when i spend time in the midwest , are pretty large in general .
and their farms are also large .
but farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny , and that 's because they 're starving .
most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers .
and most of those people are women -- which is a totally other topic that i won 't get on right now , but i 'd love to do the feminist thing at some point .
i think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
there 's this large , consolidated farming that 's led to what we eat in america ,
and it 's really been since around 1980 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass consolidation , mass exodus of small farmers in this country .
and then in the same time period , you know , we 've kind of left africa 's farmers to do their own thing .
unfortunately , what is farmed ends up as what we eat .
and in america , a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last 30 years .
it 's crazy .
a fifth of kids under two drinks soda .
hello . you don 't put soda in bottles .
but people do because it 's so cheap ,
and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted .
i think , you know , it 's not just in our own country , but really we 're exporting the system around the world ,
and when you look at the data of least developed countries -- especially in cities , which are growing really rapidly -- people are eating american processed foods .
and in one generation , they 're going from hunger , and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger , to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation .
so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .
not to beat a dead horse , but this is a global food system where there 's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .
i think that 's the only way to look at it .
and instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate , it 's really important to look at them as one system .
we get a lot of our food from all around the world ,
and people from all around the world are importing our food system ,
so it 's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it .
the thing is , i 've learned -- and the technology people that are here , which i 'm totally not one of them -- but apparently , it really takes 30 years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us , like the mouse and the internet and windows .
you know , there 's 30-year cycles .
i think 2010 can be a really interesting year
because it is the end of the 30-year cycle ,
and it 's the birthday of the global food system .
so that 's the first birthday i want to talk about .
you know , i think if we really think that this is something that 's happened in the last 30 years , there 's hope in that .
it 's the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp , chicken mcnuggets , high fructose corn syrup , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we 've addressed agriculture internationally .
so there 's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system .
i 'm not the only one who 's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing .
the icons like michael pollan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
well , i really care about 1980 because it 's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year .
and so in my lifetime , a lot of what 's happened in the world -- and being a person obsessed with food -- a lot of this has really changed .
so my second dream is that i think we can look to the next 30 years as a time to change the food system again .
and we know what 's happened in the past , so if we start now , and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term , we might be able to recreate the food system
so when i give my next talk and i 'm 60 years old , i 'll be able to say that it 's been a success .
so i 'm announcing today the start of a new organization , or a new fund within the feed foundation , called the 30 project .
and the 30 project is really focused on these long-term ideas for food system change .
and i think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity , we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different ,
and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world ,
but if we take a 30-year view , there 's more hope in collaborative ideas .
so i 'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food , which don 't seem right now to have much in common , we can talk about holistic , long-term , systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone .
some ideas i 've had is like , look , the reality is -- kids in the south bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in botswana .
and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods ?
another thing that 's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish .
understanding how to produce protein in a way that 's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers .
and you know , these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in africa who are small farmers and people in america who are farmers and eaters .
and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way , where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips .
well , if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple , then maybe it 's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn , soy and wheat .
the 30project.org is launched , and i 've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start .
and it 'll be growing over the next few months .
but i really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change .

joshua prince-ramus believes that if architects re-engineer their design process , the results can be spectacular . speaking at tedxsmu , dallas , he walks us through his fantastic re-creation of the local wyly theater as a giant " theatrical machine " that reconfigures itself at the touch of a button .

joshua prince-ramus : building a theater that remakes itself
i 'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency .
what i mean by that is that it 's time for architecture to do things again , not just represent things .
this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
i was thrilled to get it . i was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet .
i thought it represented the importance of the architect .
i stayed thrilled until i got home ,
threw the helmet onto my bed , fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription .
now , i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today .
we are for decorative purposes only .
now , who do we have to blame ?
we can only blame ourselves . over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious .
and we architects are cowards .
so , as we have faced liability , we have stepped back and back , and unfortunately , where there is liability , guess what there is :
power .
so , eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position , way over here .
now , what did we do ? we 're cowards , but we 're smart cowards .
and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
and we announced , " hey , architecture , it 's over here , in this autonomous language we 're going to seed control of processes . " and we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .
we actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution , as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create .
now , something else happened .
and that 's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches .
and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided , but we would merely write it off as merely execution .
now i 'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act , and nine months of gestation , and , god forbid , 24 hours of child labor is merely execution .
so , what do we architects need to do ? we need to stitch back creation and execution .
and we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects .
now , if we do this , i believe we can go back 50 years and start reinjecting agency , social engineering , back into architecture .
now , there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do , like managing contracts , learning how to write contracts , understanding procurement processes , understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .
but i 'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pedantic statements .
the first is : take core positions with your client .
i know it 's shocking , right , that architecture would actually say that .
the second position is : actually take positions .
take joint positions with your client .
this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency .
but it has to be done together .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions .
and both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you 've taken .
now , i believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this .
i 'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control .
you do not know what the end result is .
but i promise you , with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment , you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention , and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of .
alright , now i 'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches .
this is the modus operandi that we have today .
we roll 120-foot spartan , i.e. our vision , up to our clients ' gates of troy . and we don 't understand why they won 't let us in . right ?
well , how about instead of doing that , we roll up to the gates something they want .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears .
so , we can change the metaphor . let 's call the trojan horse the vessel by which you get through the gate , get through the constraints of a project .
at which point , you and your client have the ability to start considering what you 're going to put inside that vessel ,
the agency , the vision .
and if you do that , you do that responsibly , i believe that instead of delivering spartans , you can deliver maidens .
and if i could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn 't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project 's and the client 's constraints ?
now , with that in mind , i 'm going to show a project that 's very dear to many people in this room-- well , maybe not dear , but certainly close to many people in this room .
and that 's a project that is just about to open next week , the new home for the dallas theater center , the dee and charles wyly theatre .
now , i 'm going to present it on the same terms : issue , position and architectural manifestation .
now , the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of new york , chicago and seattle .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership . but it also had to do with something rather unusual , and that was this horrible little building that they 'd been performing in .
why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .
when you 're on broadway , you cannot tear the proscenium down .
this building , when an artistic director wanted to do a " cherry orchard " and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage , they brought a backhoe in , and they simply dug the hole .
well , that 's exciting .
and you can start to get the best artistic directors , scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can 't do elsewhere .
so , the first position we took was , " hey , we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn 't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company . " the second issue is a nuance of the first .
and that 's that the company and the building was multiform .
that meant that they were able to perform , as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium , thrust , flat floor , arena , traverse , you name it .
all they needed was labor .
well , something happened . in fact something happened to all institutions around the world .
it started to become hard to raise operational costs , operational budgets .
so , they stopped having inexpensive labor .
and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium .
so , the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided , the ability to move between stage configurations , had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs . alright ? affordably .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .
it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house .
at first blush you think , " hey it 's crazy , what could you possibly gain ? " we created what we like to call superfly .
now , superfly , the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower , and you smear them across flytower and auditorium .
suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations .
and because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements , suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional . and you can drill , cut , nail , screw paint and replace , with a minimum of cost .
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
and that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way .
and that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief .
so , the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object .
but also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of macbeth , if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you 're seeing with dallas , with your real life , he or she can do so .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
in fact it really was the clients who had to do it .
they had to make a decision , based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure , to actually the inverse , two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture .
that 's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept .
but based on the positions , they took the educated leap of faith to do so .
and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine .
now , that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .
but it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences .
meaning : the artistic director doesn 't necessarily need to go through our lobby .
one of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects , because they say the first thing they have to do , the first five minutes of any show , is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
so , in fact , there is the building , there is what we call the draw . you 're going down into our lobby , go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium .
but there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside , in this case suggesting kind of wagnerian entrance , into the interior of the auditorium .
and here is the fruition of that in actuality . these are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside , in or from the inside , out , performers or audience alike .
now , imagine what that could be . i have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long .
but imagine the freedoms if you could take this further , that in fact you could consider a wagnerian entry , a first act in thrust , an intermission in greek , a second act in arena , and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits .
now that , i would say , is architecture performing .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
i 'll go through the three basic configurations .
this is the flat floor configuration .
you notice that there is no proscenium , the balconies have been raised up , there are no seats , the floor in the auditorium is flat .
the first configuration is easy to understand .
the balconies come down , you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that 's frontal towards the end stage , and the seats come in .
the third configuration is a little harder to understand .
here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space .
and some of the seats need to actually change their direction , and change their rake , to allow that to happen .
i 'll do it again so you can see it .
there you see it 's the side balconies for the proscenium .
and there it is in the thrust configuration .
in order to do that , again , we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks .
and they told us one important thing :
" you shall not beta-test . " meaning , nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it .
but they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building .
and the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift .
now , if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey , that would be bad .
if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night , that would also be bad .
and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will .
the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house .
in this case what we 're doing is we 're taking the orchestra floor , lifting it up , spinning it , changing the rake , taking it back to flat floor , changing the rake again . in essence , you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating , at will .
here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration .
the proscenium , also . as far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space .
here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium .
and ultimately , up in the flytower , the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur .
as i said , all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration .
but we got this other benefit , and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage dallas on the outside .
here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed . this is a trompe l 'oeil .
actually this is not a curtain . these are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves , again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify , if you chose , the operations of the theater going on behind , rehearsals and so forth .
but you also have the ability to allow the audience to see dallas , to perform with dallas as the backdrop of your performance .
now , if i 'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
effectively you would have something like this .
you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber :
" aida , " their elephants , you can bring the elephants in .
you would be able to expose the auditorium to dallas or vice versa , dallas to the auditorium .
you 'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an intermission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .
as i said , all the balconies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
the proscenium can fly .
you can bring large objects into the chamber itself .
but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure , is something that is represented by this .
and again , this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built , but at least suggests the ideas .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
now , if there is anyone here from american airlines , please consider doing your christmas party here .
that allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums .
that 's an enormous benefit .
so , the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic , light-controlled , sound-controlled , great acoustics , great intimacy shakespeare , but can also do beckett with the skyline of dallas sitting behind it .
here it is in a flat floor configuration .
the theater has been going through its kind of paces .
here it is in an end stage configuration .
it 's actually beautiful . there was a rock band .
we stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked , and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn 't hear them .
it was very unusual .
here it is in a thrust configuration .
and last but not least , you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem .
i 'm going to show you a brief time lapse .
as i said , this can be done with only two people , and with a minimum amount of time .
this is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it .
so , in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around . and think of it being done with just a few people .
again , just a couple people are required .
i promise .
et voila .
so , just in conclusion , a few shots .
this is the at & t performing arts center 's dee and charles wyly theater .
there it is at night .
and last but not least the entire at & t performing arts center .
you can see the winspear opera house on the right and the dee and charles wyly theater on the left .
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something . but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,
what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .
and we took positions with them , and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us , really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually .
thank you .

jonathan harris collects stories
so i 'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways .
this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life .
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
anyway , it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
and recently i 've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality -- so , real stories .
and specifically , i 'm interested in collecting my own stories , stories from the internet , and then recently , stories from life , which is kind of a new area of work that i 've been doing recently .
so i 'll be talking about each of those today .
so , first of all , my own stories . these are two of my sketchbooks .
i have many of these books , and i 've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .
they accompany me wherever i go in my life , and i fill them with all sorts of things , records of my lived experience :
so watercolor paintings , drawings of what i see , dead flowers , dead insects , pasted ticket stubs , rusting coins , business cards , writings .
and in these books , you can find these short , little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet .
and , you know , after keeping these books for a number of years , i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts , but also the artifacts of other people .
so , i started collecting found objects .
this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago .
on the front , you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman 's face , and on the back it says , " to judy , the girl with the bill bailey voice . have fun in whatever you do . "
and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody 's life . as opposed to knowing the whole story , just knowing a little bit of the story , and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .
and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work i 'll be showing later today .
so , around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university , and i noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts , not just from street corners , but also from the internet .
and that suddenly , people , en masse , were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives .
blog posts , photographs , thoughts , feelings , opinions , all of these things were being expressed by people online , and leaving behind trails .
so , i started to write computer programs that study very , very large sets of these online footprints .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
it 's called " we feel fine . "
this is a project that scans the world 's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes , searching for occurrences of the phrases " i feel " and " i am feeling . " and when it finds one of those phrases , it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .
so , their gender , their age , their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence .
it collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it 's been running for about a year and a half , having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now .
this is , then , how they 're presented .
these dots here represent some of the english-speaking world 's feelings from the last few hours ,
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger .
and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside , so the bright ones are happy , and the dark ones are sad .
and the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside .
so the small ones are short , and the bigger ones are longer .
" i feel fine with the body i 'm in , there 'll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend , " from a twenty-two-year-old in japan .
" i got this on some trading locally , but really don 't feel like screwing with wiring and crap . "
also , some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts . and when that happens , these montage compositions are automatically created , which consist of the sentence and images being combined .
and any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside .
" i feel good . "
" i feel rough now , and i probably gained 100,000 pounds , but it was worth it . "
" i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies , man-made forests , limestone caves and hey , even a huge python . "
so the next movement is called mobs .
this provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
this is showing the world 's most common feelings overall right now , dominated by better , then bad , then good , then guilty , and so on .
weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent . so the sunny ones swirl around , the cloudy ones float along , the rainy ones fall down , and the snowy ones flutter to the ground .
you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside .
finally , location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map , giving you a sense of their geographic distribution .
so i 'll show you now some of my favorite montages from " we feel fine . "
these are the images that are automatically constructed .
" i feel like i 'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe . "
" i 've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn 't felt good , the kisses felt messy and wrong , but kissing lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual . "
" i can feel my cancer grow . "
" i feel pretty . "
" i feel skinny , but i 'm not . "
" i 'm 23 , and a recovering meth and heroin addict , and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive . "
" i can 't wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month , because i feel the need for speed . "
" i feel sassy . "
" i feel so sexy in this new wig . "
as you can see , " we feel fine " collects very , very small-scale personal stories .
sometimes , stories as short as two or three words .
so , really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .
and recently , i 've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story .
and that 's led me to doing some work with the physical world , not with the internet , and only using the internet at the very last moment , as a presentation medium .
so these are some newer projects that actually aren 't even launched publicly yet .
the first such one is called " the whale hunt . " last may , i spent nine days living up in barrow , alaska , the northernmost settlement in the united states , with a family of inupiat eskimos , documenting their annual spring whale hunt .
this is the whaling camp here , we 're about six miles from shore , camping on five and a half feet of thick , frozen pack ice .
and that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bowhead whales migrate north each springtime .
and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here , waits for a whale to come close enough to attack . and when it does , it throws a harpoon at it , and then hauls the whale up under the ice , and cuts it up .
and that would provide the community 's food supply for a long time .
so i went up there , and i lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here , and photographed the entire experience , beginning with the taxi ride to newark airport in new york , and ending with the butchering of the second whale , seven and a half days later .
i photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals .
so every five minutes , i took a photograph .
when i was awake , with the camera around my neck . when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
so what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down , more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat .
that was the first concept here .
the second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story .
what are the things that make up a story ?
so , stories have characters . stories have concepts .
stories take place in a certain area . they have contexts .
they have colors . what do they look like ?
they have time . when did it take place ? dates -- when did it occur ?
and in the case of the whale hunt , also this idea of an excitement level .
the thing about stories , though , in most of the existing mediums that we 're accustomed to -- things like novels , radio , photographs , movies , even lectures like this one -- we 're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position ,
some kind of omniscient , external body through whose eyes you see the story .
we 're very used to this .
but if you think about real life , it 's not like that at all .
i mean , in real life , things are much more nuanced and complex , and there 's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other .
and so i thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories . so , in the case of " the whale hunt , " how could we extract something like the story of simeon and crawford , involving the concepts of wildlife , tools and blood , taking place on the arctic ocean , dominated by the color red , happening around 10 a.m. on may 3 , with an excitement level of high ?
so , how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story ?
i built a web interface for viewing " the whale hunt " that attempts to do just this .
so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
this is my studio in brooklyn . this is the arctic ocean , and the butchering of the second whale , seven days later .
you can start to see some of the story here , told by color .
so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying .
and things go white as we move out onto the arctic ocean .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
you can see a timeline , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
these are organized chronologically .
wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same , so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically .
and any of these can be clicked , and then the narrative is entered at that position .
so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska .
that 's " moby dick . "
this is the food we ate .
this is in the patkotak 's family living room in their house in barrow . the boxed wine they served us .
cigarette break outside -- i don 't smoke .
this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .
this is out at whale camp , on the arctic ocean .
this graph that i 'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph , showing the exciting moments of adrenaline .
this is the ice starting to freeze over . the snow fence they built .
and so what i 'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories .
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in " the whale hunt " and the two whales that were killed down here .
and we could do something as arbitrary as , say , extract the story of rony , involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools , taking place on the arctic ocean , at ahkivgaq camp , with the heartbeat level of fast .
and now we 've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs , and then we can enter the narrative at that position .
and you can see rony cutting up the whale here .
these whales are about 40 feet long , and weighing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
skipping ahead a bit more here , this is rony on the whale carcass .
they use no chainsaws or anything ; it 's entirely just blades , and an incredibly efficient process .
this is the guys on the rope , pulling open the carcass .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .
it 's baleen . moving on .
so what i 'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing . it 's not even a project yet .
so , just yesterday , i flew in here from singapore , and before that , i was spending two weeks in bhutan , the small himalayan kingdom nestled between tibet and india .
and i was doing a project there about happiness , interviewing a lot of local people .
so bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product , and they 've been doing this since the ' 70s .
and it leads to just a completely different value system .
it 's an incredibly non-materialistic culture , where people don 't have a lot , but they 're incredibly happy .
so i went around and i talked to people about some of these ideas .
so , i did a number of things . i asked people a number of set questions , and took a number of set photographs , and interviewed them with audio , and also took pictures .
i would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10 , which is kind of inherently absurd .
and then when they answered , i would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons , and some really sad soul holding one balloon .
but you know , even holding one balloon is like , kind of happy .
and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life , what makes them happy .
and then finally , i would ask them to make a wish .
and when they made a wish , i would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it .
so i 'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did , some of the people i spoke with .
this is an 11-year-old student .
he was playing cops and robbers with his friends , running around town , and they all had plastic toy guns .
his wish was to become a police officer .
he was getting started early . those were his hands .
i took pictures of everybody 's hands , because i think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look . i took a portrait of everybody , and asked everybody to make a funny face .
a 17-year-old student . her wish was to have been born a boy .
she thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in bhutan , and it 's a lot easier if you 're a boy .
a 28-year-old cell phone shop owner .
if you knew what paro looked like , you 'd understand how amazing it is that there 's a cell phone shop there .
he wanted to help poor people .
a 53-year-old farmer . she was chaffing wheat , and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make .
she wanted to keep farming until she dies .
you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here .
she was wearing this silver ring that had the word " love " engraved on it , and she 'd found it in the road somewhere .
a 16-year-old quarry worker .
this guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight , but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer .
a 21-year-old monk . he was very happy .
he wanted to live a long life at the monastery .
he had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face , which i 'm told is very good luck .
he was kind of too shy to make a funny face .
a 16-year-old student .
she wanted to become an independent woman .
i asked her about that , and she said she meant that she doesn 't want to be married , because , in her opinion , when you get married in bhutan as a woman , your chances to live an independent life kind of end , and so she had no interest in that .
a 24-year-old truck driver .
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic , with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road , and he was driving one of these trucks .
but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life , like other people .
a 24-year-old road sweeper . i caught her on her lunch break .
she 'd built a little fire to keep warm , right next to the road .
her wish was to marry someone with a car .
she wanted a change in her life .
she lives in a little worker 's camp right next to the road , and she wanted a different lot on things .
an 81-year-old itinerant farmer .
i saw this guy on the side of the road , and he actually doesn 't have a home .
he travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work , and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at .
so his wish was to come with me , so that he had somewhere to live .
he had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when i asked him to make a funny face .
it was all good-natured .
a 10-year-old .
he wanted to join a school and learn to read , but his parents didn 't have enough money to send him to school .
he was eating this orange , sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into , and since there was so much saliva on his hands , this orange paste started to form on his palms .
a 37-year-old road worker .
one of the more touchy political subjects in bhutan is the use of indian cheap labor that they import from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
so these guys were in a worker 's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway .
his wish was to make some money and open a store .
a 75-year-old farmer . she was selling oranges on the side of the road .
i asked her about her wish , and she said , " you know , maybe i 'll live , maybe i 'll die , but i don 't have a wish . "
she was chewing betel nut , which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet .
i asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said , " well , you know , of course , it 's impermanent , but my plan is to live here until i 'm 30 , and then enter a hermitage . "
and i said , " you mean , like a cave ? " and she said , " yeah , like a cave . "
and i said , " wow , and how long will you live in the cave ? "
and she said , " well , you know , i think i 'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave . "
i just thought that was amazing . i mean , she spoke in a way -- with amazing english , and amazing humor , and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody i could have bumped into on the streets of new york , or in vermont , where i 'm from .
but here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
and this is what she said .
woman : i think i 'm going to stay for 35 . maybe -- maybe i 'll die .
jonathan harris : maybe you 'll die ? woman : yes .
jh : 10 years ? woman : yes , yes . jh : 10 years , that 's a long time .
woman : yes , not maybe one , 10 years , maybe i can die within one year , or something like that .
jh : are you hoping to ?
woman : ah , because you know , it 's impermanent .
jh : yeah , but -- yeah , ok . do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years , or to live for one year ?
woman : but i prefer for maybe 40 to 50 .
jh : 40 to 50 ? yeah .
woman : yes . from then , i 'm going to the heaven .
jh : well , i wish you the best of luck with it .
woman : thank you .
jh : i hope it 's everything that you hope it will be .
so thank you again , so much .
woman : you 're most welcome .
jh : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
so , the last thing we did , very quickly , is i took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes -- and i brought them up to a place called dochula , which is a mountain pass in bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in bhutan .
and up there , there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years .
and we re-inflated all of the balloons , put them up on a string , and hung them up there among the prayer flags .
and they 're actually still flying up there today .
so if any of you have any bhutan travel plans in the near future , you can go check these out . here are some images from that .
we said a buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true .
you can start to see some familiar balloons here .
" to make some money and to open a store " was the indian road worker .
thanks very much .

golan levin on software art
imagine spending seven years at mit and research laboratories , only to find out that you 're a performance artist .
i 'm also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
and i think the main thing that i 'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression .
and many of you out there are the heads of macromedia and microsoft , and in a way those are my bane :
i think there 's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what 's possible on the computer .
of course , it 's also a great liberating force that makes possible , you know , publishing and so forth , and standards , and so on .
but , in a way , the computer makes possible much more than what most people think , and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer , and so i end up writing software to do that .
chris has asked me to do a short performance , and so i 'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that , and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form .
thank you .
we 've got about a minute left .
i 'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project .
i did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths .
and this just came off last september at ars electronica ; we repeated it in england .
and the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen .
we used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were .
and since we know where their heads are , and we have a wireless mic on them that we 're processing the sound from , we 're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they 're doing with their speech .
this will take about 30 seconds or so .
he 's making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
well , suffice it to say it 's not all like that , but that 's part of it .
thanks very much . there 's always lots more .
i 'm overtime , so i just wanted to say you can , if you 're in new york , you can check out my work at the whitney biennial next week , and also at bitforms gallery in chelsea .
and with that , i think i should give up the stage ,
so , thank you so much .

george whitesides : a lab the size of a postage stamp
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
how do you do that ?
and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you , i want to suggest to you , is treat disease you have to first know what you 're treating -- that 's diagnostics -- and then you have to do something .
so , the program that we 're involved in is something which we call diagnostics for all , or zero-cost diagnostics .
how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost ? how do you do it ?
let me just give you two examples .
the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources , a rigorous environment , a series of problems in lightweight , and things of this kind --
and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world .
so , the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world , for the developing world , but it has , i think , much broader application , because information is so important in the healthcare system .
so , you see two examples here .
one is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in africa .
the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what in a table in a market .
i don 't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there .
but it 's not really what is probably most efficient .
what is our approach ?
and the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost , starting from the perspective of the united states , is to take our solution , and then to try to cut cost out of it .
no matter how you do that , you 're not going to start with a 100,000-dollar instrument and bring it down to no-cost . it isn 't going to work .
so , the approach that we took was the other way around .
to ask , " what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of , and get useful information , add function ? " and what we 've chosen is paper .
what you see here is a prototypic device .
it 's about a centimeter on the side .
it 's about the size of a fingernail .
the lines around the edges are a polymer .
it 's made of paper and paper , of course , wicks fluid ,
as you know , paper , cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth , and the wine wicks all over everything .
put it on your shirt , it ruins the shirt .
that 's what a hydrophilic surface does .
so , in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of , in this case , urine .
the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top .
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine ,
the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine .
and the combination of those two
is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want .
so , this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper .
now , how simple can you make the production ?
why do we choose paper ?
there 's an example of the same thing on a finger , showing you basically what it looks like .
one reason for using paper is that it 's everywhere .
we have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps , and all kinds of stuff .
so , the production capability is there .
the second is , you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place .
i 'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like 100,000 tests , something of that kind .
and then finally , a point that you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine : it eliminates sharps .
and what sharps means is needles , things that stick .
if you 've taken a sample of someone 's blood and the someone might have hepatitis c , you don 't want to make a mistake and stick it in you .
it just -- you don 't want to do that .
so , how do you dispose of that ? it 's a problem everywhere .
and here you simply burn it .
so , it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things .
now , you say , " if paper is a good idea , other people have surely thought of it . "
and the answer is , of course , yes .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
and the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left .
it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay .
in that particular test , urine either , containing a hormone called hcg , does or does not flow across a piece of paper .
and there are two bars . one bar indicates that the test is working ,
and if the second bar shows up , you 're pregnant .
this is a terrific kind of test in a binary world ,
and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you 're not pregnant .
you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort .
so , it works very well there ,
but it doesn 't work very well when you need more quantitative information .
there are also dipsticks ,
but if you look at the dipsticks , they 're for another kind of urine analysis .
there are an awful lot of colors and things like that .
what do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance ?
so , the approach that we started with is to ask : is it really practical to make things of this sort ?
and that problem is now , in a purely engineering way , solved .
and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .
you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer .
the wax printer does what looks like printing .
it is printing . you put that on , you warm it a little bit ,
the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper ,
and you end up with the device that you want .
the printers cost 800 bucks now .
they 'll make , we estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day they 'd make about 10 million tests a year .
so , it 's a solved problem , that particular problem is solved .
and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see .
that 's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper .
that takes about two seconds to make .
and so i regard that as done .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it 's a printer , a color printer , it prints colors . that 's what color printers do .
i 'll show you in a moment , that 's actually quite useful .
now , the next question that you would like to ask is : what would you like to measure ? what would you like to analyze ?
and the thing which you 'd most like to analyze , we 're a fair distance from .
it 's what 's called " fever of undiagnosed origin . "
someone comes into the clinic , they have a fever , they feel bad . what do they have ?
do they have t.b. ? do they have aids ?
do they have a common cold ?
the triage problem . that 's a hard problem for reasons that i won 't go through .
there are an awful lot of things that you 'd like to distinguish among .
but then there are a series of things : aids , hepatitis , malaria , tb , others
and simpler ones , such as guidance of treatment .
now even that 's more complicated than you think .
a friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry ,
and he is interested in the question of why people do and don 't take their meds .
so , dapsone , or something like that , you have to take it for a while .
he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in india
and saying , " have you taken your dapsone ? " " yes . "
" have you taken it every day ? " " yes . " " have you taken if for a month ? " " yes . "
what the guy actually meant was that he 'd fed a 30-day dose of dapsone to his dog , that morning .
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a surrogate for you , you know , " today , " " this month , " " since the rainy season " -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding ,
and so an issue here is to , in some cases , to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting , like compliance .
now , take a look at what a typical test looks like .
prick a finger , you get some blood , about 50 microliters .
that 's about all you 're going to get ,
because you can 't use the usual sort of systems .
you can 't manipulate it very well , although i 'll show something about that in a moment .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipulations ,
you put it on a little device ,
the device filters out the blood cells , lets the serum go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
and the colors indicate " disease " or " normal . "
but even that 's complicated ,
because to you , to me , colors might indicate " normal , "
but , after all , we 're all suffering from probably an excess of education .
what you do about something which requires quantitative analysis ?
and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there , and at this point there is a dramatic flourish , and out comes the universal solution to everything these days , which is a cell phone . in this particular case , a camera phone .
they 're everywhere , six billion a month in india .
and the idea is that what one does , is to take the device ,
you dip it , you develop the color ,
you take a picture , the picture goes to a central laboratory .
you don 't have to send out a doctor ,
you send out somebody who can just take the sample ,
and in the clinic either a doctor , or ideally a computer in this case , does the analysis .
turns out to work actually quite well , particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work .
so , my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor , but is an 18-year-old , otherwise unemployed , who has two things : he has a backpack full of these tests ,
and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample , and an ak-47 .
and these are the things that get him through his day .
there 's another very interesting connection here ,
and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system .
it turns out there 's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the mars rover problem .
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
and the answer is not complicated but it 's one which i don 't want to go through here , other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood .
also , a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer .
this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped .
i don 't know whether the idea of one computer , one child makes any sense . here 's the computer of the future ,
because this screen is already there and they 're ubiquitous .
all right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices .
and we 'll start by posing a little problem .
what you see here is another centimeter-sized device ,
and the different colors are different colors of dye .
and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting , which is the yellow seems to disappear , get through the blue , and then get through the red .
how does that happen ? how do you make something flow through something ?
and , of course the answer is , " you don 't . "
you make it flow under and over .
but now the question is : how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper ?
the answer is that what you do , and the details are not terribly important here , is to make something more elaborate : you take several different layers of paper , each one containing its own little fluid system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , double-sided carpet tape , the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .
and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next .
it distributes itself , flows through further holes , distributes itself .
and what you see , at the lower right-hand side there , is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top , and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom , in a piece of paper -- basically it looks like a chip , two pieces of paper thick .
and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that .
but that is , in principle , the way you solve the " fever of unexplained origin " problem ,
because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease ,
and this will work in due course .
here is an example of a slightly more complicated device .
there 's the chip .
you dip in a corner . the fluid goes into the center .
it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes , and turns color ,
and all done with paper and carpet tape .
so , i think it 's as low-cost as we 're likely to be able to come up and make things .
now , i have one last , two last little stories to tell you , in finishing off this business .
this is one : one of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum .
and the question was , here we do it by taking a sample ,
we put it in a centrifuge ,
we spin it , and you get blood cells out . terrific .
what happens if you don 't have an electricity , and a centrifuge , and whatever ?
and we thought for a while of how you might do this
and the way , in fact , you do it is what 's shown here .
you get an eggbeater , which is everywhere , and you saw off a blade ,
and then you take tubing , and you stick it on that . you put the blood in , you spin it --
somebody sits there and spins it .
it works really , really well .
and we sat down , we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journal .
we were very proud of this , particularly the title , which was " eggbeater as centrifuge . "
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
i called up the editor and i said , " what 's going on ? how is this possible ? "
the editor said , with enormous disdain , " i read this .
and we 're not going to publish it , because we only publish science . "
and it 's an important issue because it means that we have to , as a society , think about what we value .
and if it 's just papers and phys. rev. letters , we 've got a problem .
here is another example of something which is --
this is a little spectrophotometer .
it measures the absorption of light in a sample
the neat thing about this is , you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz ,
another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz ,
and so you can run this system in broad daylight .
it performs about equivalently to a system that 's in the order of 100,000 dollars . it costs 50 dollars . we can probably make it for 50 cents , if we put our mind to it .
why doesn 't somebody do it ? and the answer is , " how do you make a profit in a capitalist system , doing that ? "
interesting problem .
so , let me finish by saying that we 've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem .
and we 've asked : what is the scientific unifying idea here ?
and we 've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity .
simplicity is a neat word . and you 've got to think about what simplicity means .
i know what it is but i don 't actually know what it means .
so , i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
and the most recent involved a couple of people at mit , one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people i would think of who 's an authentic genius .
we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .
and i want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought .
so , in a sense , you get what you pay for .
thank you very much .

rory stewart : time to end the war in afghanistan
the question today is not : why did we invade afghanistan ?
the question is : why are we still in afghanistan one decade later ?
why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict ?
how has this happened ?
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
we came out of the end of the cold war in despair .
we faced rwanda ; we faced bosnia , and then we rediscovered our confidence .
in the third act , we went into bosnia and kosovo and we seemed to succeed .
in the fourth act , with our hubris , our overconfidence developing , we invaded iraq and afghanistan ,
and in the fifth act , we plunged into a humiliating mess .
so the question is : what are we doing ?
why are we still stuck in afghanistan ?
and the answer , of course , that we keep being given is as follows : we 're told that we went into afghanistan because of 9 / 11 , and that we remain there because the taliban poses an existential threat to global security .
in the words of president obama , " if the taliban take over again , they will invite back al-qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . " the story that we 're told is that there was a " light footprint " initially -- in other words , that we ended up in a situation where we didn 't have enough troops , we didn 't have enough resources , that afghans were frustrated --
they felt there wasn 't enough progress and economic development and security , and therefore the taliban came back --
that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments , but we still didn 't put enough troops on the ground .
and that it wasn 't until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , " the strategy , the leadership and the resources . "
so , as the president now reassures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
all of this is wrong .
every one of those statements is wrong .
afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security .
it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- they simply don 't have a conventional military option .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i 'm wrong , it 's extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
from the taliban 's point of view , that was their number one mistake last time .
if they hadn 't invited back al-qaeda , they would still be in power today .
and even if i 'm wrong about those two things , even if they were able to take back the country , even if they were to invite back al-qaeda , it 's extremely unlikely that al-qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the united states or harm europe .
because this isn 't the 1990s anymore .
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
furthermore , it 's simply not true that what went wrong in afghanistan is the light footprint .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
and these troops that we brought in -- it 's a great picture of david beckham there on the sub-machine gun -- made the situation worse , not better .
when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 , what i saw was scenes like this .
a girl , if you 're lucky , in the corner of a dark room -- lucky to be able to look at the koran .
but in those early days when we 're told we didn 't have enough troops and enough resources , we made a lot of progress in afghanistan .
within a few months , there were two and a half million more girls in school .
in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .
today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
there was amazing improvements .
we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million afghans had mobile telephones .
and we had progress in the free media . we had progress in elections -- all of this with the so-called light footprint .
but when we began to bring more money , when we began to invest more resources , things got worse , not better . how ?
well first see , if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like afghanistan where the entire revenue of the afghan state is one billion dollars a year , you drown everything .
it 's not simply corruption and waste that you create ; you essentially replace the priorities of the afghan government , the elected afghan government , with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities .
and the same is true for the troops .
when i walked across afghanistan , i stayed with people like this .
this is commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj .
commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj was a great host .
he was very generous , like many of the afghans i stayed with .
but he was also considerably more conservative , considerably more anti-foreign , considerably more islamist than we 'd like to acknowledge .
this man , for example , mullah mustafa , tried to shoot me .
and the reason i 'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened , and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him , having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house , why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .
but 18 months later , i asked him why he had tried to shoot me .
and mullah mustafa -- he 's the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , nadir shah had bet him that he couldn 't hit me .
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa .
it 's not ; it 's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
but it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it .
2005 , anthony fitzherbert , an agricultural engineer , could travel through helmand , could stay in nad ali , sangin and ghoresh , which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place .
today , he could never do that .
so the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the taliban insurgency is mistaken .
rather than preceding the insurgency , the taliban followed the troop deployment ,
and as far as i 'm concerned , the troop deployment caused their return .
now is this a new idea ?
no , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years .
i ran a center at harvard from 2008 to 2010 ,
and there were people like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently , who 've traveled to almost every district in the country .
andrew wilder , for example , born on the pakistan-iranian border , served his whole life in pakistan and afghanistan .
paul fishstein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for save the children , ran the afghan research and evaluation unit .
these are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making afghanistan less secure , not more secure -- that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
instead , there was a litany of astonishing optimism .
beginning in 2004 , every general came in saying , " i 've inherited a dismal situation , but finally i have the right resources and the correct strategy , which will deliver , " in general barno 's word in 2004 , the " decisive year . "
well guess what ? it didn 't .
but it wasn 't sufficient to prevent general abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver , in 2005 , the " decisive year . "
or general david richards to come in 2006 and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the " crunch year . "
or in 2007 , the norwegian deputy foreign minister , espen eide , to say that that would deliver the " decisive year . "
or in 2008 , major general champoux to come in and say he would deliver the " decisive year . "
or in 2009 , my great friend , general stanley mcchrystal , who said that he was " knee-deep in the decisive year . "
or in 2010 , the u.k. foreign secretary , david miliband , who said that at last we would deliver the " decisive year . "
and you 'll be delighted to hear in 2011 , today , that guido westerwelle , the german foreign minister , assures us that we are in the " decisive year . "
how do we allow any of this to happen ?
well the answer , of course , is , if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country , you co-opt almost everybody . even the aid agencies , who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the u.s. and the european governments to build schools and clinics , are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that afghanistan is an existential threat to global security .
they 're worried , in other words , that if anybody believes that it wasn 't such a threat -- oxfam , save the children wouldn 't get the money to build their hospitals and schools .
it 's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest .
it 's very difficult for a politician , because you 're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain .
you feel deep , deep guilt .
you exaggerate your fears ,
and you 're terrified about the humiliation of defeat .
what is the solution to this ?
well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like michael semple , or those other people , who are telling the truth , who know the country , who 've spent 30 years on the ground -- and most importantly of all , the missing component of this -- afghans themselves , who understand what is going on .
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
and this is very difficult to do because of our structures .
the first thing we need to change is the structures of our government .
very , very sadly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what 's going on .
the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ; italian soldiers , on tours of four months ; the american military , on tours of 12 months .
diplomats are locked in embassy compounds .
when they go out , they travel in these curious armored vehicles
with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour .
in the british embassy in afghanistan in 2008 , an embassy of 350 people , there were only three people who could speak dari , the main language of afghanistan , at a decent level .
and there was not a single pashto speaker .
in the afghan section in london responsible for governing afghan policy on the ground , i was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in afghanistan .
so we need to change that institutional culture .
and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations .
secondly , we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals . we need to make sure that we 're a little bit suspicious , that we understand that optimism is in the dna of the military ,
that we don 't respond to it with quite as much alacrity .
and thirdly , we need to have some humility .
we need to begin from the position that our knowledge , our power , our legitimacy is limited .
this doesn 't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster .
it isn 't .
bosnia and kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
today when you go to bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990s happened .
it 's almost impossible to believe the progress we 've made since 1994 .
refugee return , which the united nations high commission for refugees thought would be extremely unlikely , has largely happened .
a million properties have been returned .
borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .
the national army has shrunk .
the crime rates in bosnia today are lower than they are in sweden .
this has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by bosnians themselves .
but you need to look at context .
and this is what we 've lost in afghanistan and iraq .
you need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
and finally , we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement .
we criticized people a lot in bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals .
we criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees .
but that slowness , that caution , the fact that president clinton initially said that american troops would only be deployed for a year , turned out to be a strength , and it helped us to put our priorities right .
one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan is that we 've got our priorities out of sync .
we 're not matching our resources to our priorities .
because if what we 're interested in is terrorism , pakistan is far more important than afghanistan .
if what we 're interested in is regional stability , egypt is far more important .
if what we 're worried about is poverty and development , sub-saharan africa is far more important .
this doesn 't mean that afghanistan doesn 't matter , but that it 's one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage .
so if i can finish with a metaphor for intervention , what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue .
why mountain rescue ?
because when people talk about intervention , they imagine that some scientific theory -- the rand corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population .
this is the wrong way of looking at it .
you need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue .
when you 're doing mountain rescue , you don 't take a doctorate in mountain rescue , you look for somebody who knows the terrain .
it 's about context .
you understand that you can prepare , but the amount of preparation you can do is limited --
you can take some water , you can have a map , you can have a pack .
but what really matters is two kinds of problems -- problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn 't anticipate , such as , for example , ice on a slope , but which you can get around , and problems which you couldn 't anticipate and which you can 't get around , like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather .
and the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain , in every temperature , at every period --
a guide who , above all , knows when to turn back , who doesn 't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them .
what we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities .
because the worst thing we have done in afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option .
it makes failure invisible , inconceivable and inevitable .
and if we can resist this crazy slogan , we shall discover -- in egypt , in syria , in libya , and anywhere else we go in the world -- that if we can often do much less than we pretend , we can do much more than we fear .
thank you . thank you very much .
thank you . thank you very much .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
bruno giussani : rory , you mentioned libya at the end .
just briefly , what 's your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
rory stewart : okay , i think libya poses the classic problem .
the problem in libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
and we are always being tempted up to our neck .
we put our toes in and we go up to our neck .
what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the u.n. resolution .
we should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in benghazi .
we could have done that .
we set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours because gaddafi had no planes within 48 hours .
instead of which , we 've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change .
in doing so , we 've destroyed our credibility with the security council , which means it 's very difficult to get a resolution on syria , and we 're setting ourselves up again for failure .
once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
bg : rory , thank you very much .
rs : thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / nate _ silver _ on _ race _ and _ politics.html
nate silver has answers to controversial questions about race in politics : did obama 's race hurt his votes in some places ? stats and myths collide in this fascinating talk that ends with a remarkable insight on how town planning can promote tolerance .
cities , politics , race , statistics , urban planning
521
nate silver : does race affect votes ?
i want to talk about the election .
for the first time in the united states , a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president .
and in fact barack obama did quite well .
he won 375 electoral votes .
and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race , of any party -- in history .
if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier -- democrats really like seeing this transition here , where almost every state becomes bluer , becomes more democratic -- even states obama lost , like out west ,
those states became more blue .
in the south , in the northeast , almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there .
one exception is in massachusetts .
that was john kerry 's home state .
no big surprise , obama couldn 't do better than kerry there .
or in arizona , which is john mccain 's home ,
obama didn 't have much improvement .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
this kind of arkansas , tennessee , oklahoma , west virginia region .
now if you look at ' 96 , bill clinton -- the last democrat to actually win -- how he did in ' 96 , you see real big differences in this part of the country right here , the kind of appalachians , ozarks , highlands region , as i call it :
20 or 30 point swings from how bill clinton did in ' 96 to how obama did in 2008 .
yes bill clinton was from arkansas , but these are very , very profound differences .
so , when we think about parts of the country like arkansas , you know .
there is a book written called , " what 's the matter with kansas ? "
but really the question here -- obama did relatively well in kansas .
he lost badly but every democrat does .
he lost no worse than most people do .
but yeah , what 's the matter with arkansas ?
and when we think of arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations .
we think of a bunch of rednecks , quote , unquote , with guns .
and we think people like this probably don 't want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
we think it 's a matter of race . and is this fair ?
are we kind of stigmatizing people from arkansas , and this part of the country ?
and the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
we know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people .
actually we didn 't ask them , but when they conducted exit polls in every state , in 37 states , out of the 50 , they asked a question , that was pretty direct , about race .
they asked this question .
in deciding your vote for president today , was the race of the candidate a factor ?
we 're looking for people that said , " yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , "
and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
we 're looking for this behavior among white voters or , really , non-black voters .
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
in louisiana , about one in five white voters said , " yes , one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african-american . "
if those people had voted for obama , even half of them , obama would have won louisiana safely .
same is true with , i think , all of these states you see on the top of the list .
meanwhile , california , new york , we can say , " oh we 're enlightened " but you know , certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted , i suppose , manifestation of racially-based voting .
here is the same data on a map .
you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said , " yes , barack obama 's race was a problem for me . "
you see , comparing the map to ' 96 , you see an overlap here .
this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country .
so we have to ask why .
is racism predictable in some way ?
is there something driving this ?
is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in arkansas that we don 't understand , and kentucky ?
or are there more systematic factors at work ?
and so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time -- things like income , and religion , education .
which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november 4th ?
and there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships , one of which is education ,
where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red , and you see this part of the country , the kind of appalachians region , is less educated . it 's just a fact .
and you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
states that are more rural -- even to some extent of the states like new hampshire and maine -- they exhibit a little bit of this racially-based voting against barack obama .
so it 's the combination of these two things : it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we 'll talk about more in a moment .
and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural , and they are educationally impoverished .
so yes , racism is predictable .
these things , among maybe other variables , but these things seem to predict it .
we 're going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the general social survey .
this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year .
and they ask a series of really interesting questions .
in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
one simple question they asked is , " does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? "
we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different .
in cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race ,
but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
probably because if you live on a farm , you might not have a lot of neighbors , period .
but nevertheless , you 're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
so what we 're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .
and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes , not a lot of difference .
this was eight years ago , some people were more republican back then .
but you see democrats versus republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
and even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action , which is kind of a political question , a policy question about race , if you will --
not much difference here .
affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period .
but people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really .
but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will , " do you favor a law banning interracial marriage ? "
there is a big difference .
people who don 't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do .
just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , " would you not vote for a qualified black president ? "
you see people without neighbors who are african-american who were much more likely to say , " that would give me a problem . "
so it 's really not even about urban versus rural .
it 's about who you live with .
racism is predictable . and it 's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you , people of other races .
so if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races .
i have a couple of very obvious , i suppose , ideas for maybe how to do that .
i 'm a big fan of cities .
especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
i think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
but also not everyone wants to live in a city , certainly not a city like new york .
so we can think more about things like street grids .
this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing , michigan .
it 's a traditional midwestern community , which means you have real grid .
you have real neighborhoods and real trees , and real streets you can walk on .
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
and as a result it 's a very tolerant community , which is different , i think , than something like this , which is in schaumburg , illinois ,
where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through starbucks and stuff like that .
i think that actually this type of urban design , which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan .
but also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
but the point is , this is all good news ,
because when something is predictable , it is what i call designable .
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem ,
even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn 't , we can start to design solutions to it .
so that 's all i have to say . thank you very much .

bryan stevenson : we need to talk about an injustice
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hopelessness .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .
and one of the things that 's emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and we 've had some fantastic presentations .
and i think what we 've learned is that , if you 're a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you 're a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you 're a doctor you can do some good things , but if you 're a caring doctor you can do some other things .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and i didn 't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 's .
she was born in the 1880 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs .
and she 'd squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she 'd let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she 'd come over to me and she 'd say , " bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? " and if i said , " no , " she 'd assault me again , and if i said , " yes , " she 'd leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i 'd smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , " come on , bryan . you and i are going to have a talk . " and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , " bryan , i 'm going to tell you something , but you don 't tell anybody what i tell you . " i said , " okay , mama . " she said , " now you make sure you don 't do that . " i said , " sure . "
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , " i want you to know i 've been watching you . "
and she said , " i think you 're special . "
she said , " i think you can do anything you want to do . " i will never forget it .
and then she said , " i just need you to promise me three things , bryan . " i said , " okay , mama . " she said , " the first thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always love your mom . " she said , " that 's my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you 'll always take care of her . " well i adored my mom , so i said , " yes , mama . i 'll do that . " then she said , " the second thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . " and i thought about it and i said , " yes , mama . i 'll do that . " then finally she said , " the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol . " well i was nine years old , so i said , " yes , mama . i 'll do that . " i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer -- i don 't know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
i said , " no , no , no . that 's okay . you all go ahead . i 'm not going to have any beer . " my brother said , " come on . we 're doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . " i said , " no , i don 't feel right about that . y 'all go ahead . y 'all go ahead . " and then my brother started staring at me .
he said , " what 's wrong with you ? have some beer . " then he looked at me real hard and he said , " oh , i hope you 're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . " i said , " well , what are you talking about ? " he said , " oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they 're special . " i was devastated .
and i 'm going to admit something to you .
i 'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn 't .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
but i 'm 52 years old , and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol .
i don 't say that because i think that 's virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don 't actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don 't think they can do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
my male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
well i 've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
today , there are 2.3 million .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
we have seven million people on probation and parole .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on probation or parole .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
our system isn 't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they 're also distorted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you 're rich and guilty than if you 're poor and innocent .
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we 've been disconnected .
it 's interesting to me .
we 're looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
we 're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it 's been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and there is this stunning silence .
i represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
and we 're actually doing some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
it 's interesting , this question of the death penalty .
in many ways , we 've been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they 've committed ?
and that 's a very sensible question .
but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit ,
but do we deserve to kill ?
i mean , it 's fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been executed , we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been exonerated and released from death row .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
i mean , it 's fascinating .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
it 's not our problem .
it 's not our burden .
it 's not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
and it 's interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about slavery .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
we don 't really know very much about it .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
they had to worry about being bombed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , " mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after 9 / 11 . "
they tell me to say , " no , tell them that we grew up with that . "
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don 't like to talk about our problems .
we don 't like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven 't understood what it 's meant to do the things we 've done historically .
we 're constantly running into each other .
we 're constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it 's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn 't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven 't done that .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , " well you know it 's deeply troubling to hear what you 're talking about . "
he said , " we don 't have the death penalty in germany .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . " and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , " there 's no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
it would be unconscionable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . " and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
i couldn 't bear it .
it would be unconscionable .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you 're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
well i believe that our identity is at risk . that when we actually don 't care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , those realities are shadowed by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven 't seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
and it 's that mind-heart connection that i believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
vaclav havel , the great czech leader , talked about this .
he said , " when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . " well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to unfairness , to injustice .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don 't pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia durr , a white woman , whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr. king .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then ms. carr would call me , and she 'd say , " bryan , ms. parks is coming to town . we 're going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? " and i 'd say , " yes , ma 'am , i do . " and she 'd say , " well what are you going to do when you get here ? " i said , " i 'm going to listen . "
and i 'd go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it would be so energizing and so empowering .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , " now bryan , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what you 're trying to do . " and i began giving her my rap .
i said , " well we 're trying to challenge injustice .
we 're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
we 're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
we 're trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
we 're trying to do something about the death penalty .
we 're trying to reduce the prison population .
we 're trying to end mass incarceration . " i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , " mmm mmm mmm . "
she said , " that 's going to make you tired , tired , tired . " and that 's when ms. carr leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , " that 's why you 've got to be brave , brave , brave . " and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering . because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity .
i 've learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it 's just taught me very simple things .
i 've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we 've ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they 're not just a liar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn 't belong to them , they 're not just a thief .
i think even if you kill someone , you 're not just a killer .
and because of that there 's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don 't believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won 't be judged by our design , we won 't be judged by our intellect and reason .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
because it 's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
i sometimes get out of balance . i 'll end with this story .
i sometimes push too hard .
i do get tired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i 've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who 's 13 and 14 , and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you 're not ?
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you 're not , the judge must have magic power .
yeah , bryan , the judge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn 't thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : " motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white 75-year-old corporate executive . " and i put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no conduct in this county , it 's all misconduct .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , " who are you ? " i said , " i 'm a lawyer . " he said , " you 're a lawyer ? " i said , " yes , sir . "
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and he whispered in my ear .
he said , " i 'm so proud of you . " and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
well i went into the courtroom .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , " mr. stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? " i said , " yes , sir . i did . " and we started arguing .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
i had written these crazy things .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecuters and clerk workers .
and before i knew it , the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
he kept pacing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , " jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? " and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , " i came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . " i 've come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i 've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
thank you very much .
chris anderson : so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
bs : well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there 's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there 's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
for example , here in california we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don 't result in arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases don 't result .
so there 's an opportunity to change that .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
ca : there 's been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it 's about increased incarceration rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
bs : well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn 't really in violent crime categories .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
that 's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and i think that 's the orientation that we have to change .
ca : bryan , you 've struck a massive chord here .
you 're an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .

modern medicine is in danger of losing a powerful , old-fashioned tool : human touch . physician and writer abraham verghese describes our strange new world where patients are merely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-on-one physical exam .

abraham verghese : a doctor 's touch
a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live , and she was brought in confused .
her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170 .
within a few minutes , she went into cardiac collapse .
she was resuscitated , stabilized , whisked over to a cat scan suite right next to the emergency room , because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung .
and the cat scan revealed no blood clots in the lung , but it showed bilateral , visible , palpable breast masses , breast tumors , that had metastasized widely all over the body .
and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
four or five opportunities to see the breast masses , touch the breast mass , intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her .
ladies and gentlemen , that is not an unusual story .
unfortunately , it happens all the time .
i joke , but i only half joke , that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb , no one will believe you till they get a cat scan , mri or orthopedic consult .
i am not a luddite .
i teach at stanford .
i 'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology .
but i 'd like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam , when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient , we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable , early stage , but we 're losing much more than that .
we 're losing a ritual .
we 're losing a ritual that i believe is transformative , transcendent , and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship .
this may actually be heresy to say this at ted , but i 'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation , i think , in medicine to come in the next 10 years , and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch , to comfort , to diagnose and to bring about treatment .
i 'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize .
this is sir arthur conan doyle .
since we 're in edinburgh , i 'm a big fan of conan doyle .
you might not know that conan doyle went to medical school here in edinburgh , and his character , sherlock holmes , was inspired by sir joseph bell .
joseph bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts .
and conan doyle , writing about bell , described the following exchange between bell and his students .
so picture bell sitting in the outpatient department , students all around him , patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in .
and a woman comes in with a child , and conan doyle describes the following exchange .
the woman says , " good morning . "
bell says , " what sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from burntisland ? "
she says , " it was good . "
and he says , " what did you do with the other child ? "
she says , " i left him with my sister at leith . "
and he says , " and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary ? "
she says , " i did . "
and he says , " would you still be working at the linoleum factory ? "
and she says , " i am . "
and bell then goes on to explain to the students .
he says , " you see , when she said , ' good morning , ' i picked up her fife accent .
and the nearest ferry crossing from fife is from burntisland .
and so she must have taken the ferry over .
you notice that the coat she 's carrying is too small for the child who is with her , and therefore , she started out the journey with two children , but dropped one off along the way .
you notice the clay on the soles of her feet .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of edinburgh , except in the botanical gardens .
and therefore , she took a short cut down inverleith row to arrive here .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . "
and when bell actually strips the patient , begins to examine the patient , you can only imagine how much more he would discern .
and as a teacher of medicine , as a student myself , i was so inspired by that story .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
the picture i 'm showing you is of leopold auenbrugger who , in the late 1700s , discovered percussion .
and the story is that leopold auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper .
and his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder .
and so when auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
he began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens .
and basically everything we know about percussion , which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day -- organ enlargement , fluid around the heart , fluid in the lungs , abdominal changes -- all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript " inventum novum , " " new invention , " which would have disappeared into obscurity , except for the fact that this physician , corvisart , a famous french physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentleman -- corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work .
and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope .
laennec , it is said , was walking in the streets of paris and saw two children playing with a stick .
one was scratching at the end of the stick , another child listened at the other end .
and laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called " the cylinder . "
later he renamed it the stethoscope .
and that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
so within a few years , in the late 1800s , early 1900s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis .
if you 'll recall , prior to that time , no matter what ailed you , you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you , bleeding you , purging you .
and , oh yes , if you wanted , he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides , long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it .
he made no attempt at diagnosis .
in fact , some of you might well know that the barber pole , the red and white stripes , represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon , and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected .
but the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change , a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body .
and this particular painting , i think , represents the pinnacle , the peak , of that clinical era .
this is a very famous painting : " the doctor " by luke fildes .
luke fildes was commissioned to paint this by tate , who then established the tate gallery .
and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance .
and it 's interesting that fildes picked this topic .
fildes ' oldest son , philip , died at the age of nine on christmas eve after a brief illness .
and fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two , three nights , that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time -- almost a tribute to this physician .
and hence the painting " the doctor , " a very famous painting .
it 's been on calendars , postage stamps in many different countries .
i 've often wondered , what would fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient ?
i 've gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who 's in the computer .
i 've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer .
i call it the ipatient .
the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america .
the real patient often wonders , where is everyone ? when are they going to come by and explain things to me ? who 's in charge ?
there 's a real disjunction between the patient 's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care .
i want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when i was in training .
the focus was around the patient .
we went from bed to bed . the attending physician was in charge .
too often these days , rounds look very much like this , where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient .
the discussion is all about images on the computer , data .
and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
now i 've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that i want to share with you .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived .
this is when i was in texas .
and she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care .
and she found the place and decided to go there , went there .
which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town , getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist .
and i pressed her , and i asked her , " why did you come back and get your care here ? "
and she was reluctant to tell me .
she said , " the cancer center was wonderful .
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
but , " she said , " but they did not touch my breasts . "
now you and i could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts .
they had her scanned inside out .
they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ; they had no need to touch her breasts .
but to her , it mattered deeply .
it was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who , every time she went , examined both breasts including the axillary tail , examined her axilla carefully , examined her cervical region , her inguinal region , did a thorough exam .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed .
i was very influenced by that anecdote .
i was also influenced by another experience that i had , again , when i was in texas , before i moved to stanford .
i had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue .
this is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy .
i say that because these are difficult patients .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to disappoint them .
and i learned very early on with my first patient that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of 45 minutes .
there was just no way .
and if i tried , i 'd disappoint them .
and so i hit on this method where i invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and i tried not to interrupt them .
we know the average american physician interrupts their patient in 14 seconds .
and if i ever get to heaven , it will be because i held my piece for 45 minutes and did not interrupt my patient .
i then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence , and when the patient came for the physical , i was able to do a thorough physical , because i had nothing else to do .
i like to think that i do a thorough physical exam , but because the whole visit was now about the physical , i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam .
and i remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit .
and i began my ritual .
i always begin with the pulse , then i examine the hands , then i look at the nail beds , then i slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node , and i was into my ritual .
and when my ritual began , this very voluble patient began to quiet down .
and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which i had a role and the patient had a role .
and when i was done , the patient said to me with some awe , " i have never been examined like this before . "
now if that were true , it 's a true condemnation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places .
i then proceeded to tell the patient , once the patient was dressed , the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions , which is , " this is not in your head .
this is real .
the good news , it 's not cancer , it 's not tuberculosis , it 's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
and i would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere .
and i always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor , the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness , it was because i had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination .
something of importance had transpired in the exchange .
i took this to my colleagues at stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
and they immediately said to me , " well you are describing a classic ritual . "
and they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation .
we marry , for example , with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .
i 'm not sure why you 're laughing .
that was the original intent , was it not ?
we signal transitions of power with rituals .
we signal the passage of a life with rituals .
rituals are terribly important .
they 're all about transformation .
well i would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi , and then , incredibly on top of that , disrobing and allowing touch -- i would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance .
and if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient , by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown , by not doing a complete exam , you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-physician relationship .
i am a writer , and i want to close by reading you a short passage that i wrote that has to do very much with this scene .
i 'm an infectious disease physician , and in the early days of hiv , before we had our medications , i presided over so many scenes like this .
i remember , every time i went to a patient 's deathbed , whether in the hospital or at home , i remember my sense of failure -- the feeling of i don 't know what i have to say ; i don 't know what i can say ; i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do .
and out of that sense of failure , i remember , i would always examine the patient .
i would pull down the eyelids .
i would look at the tongue .
i would percuss the chest . i would listen to the heart .
i would feel the abdomen .
i remember so many patients , their names still vivid on my tongue , their faces still so clear .
i remember so many huge , hollowed out , haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual .
and then the next day , i would come , and i would do it again .
and i wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient .
" i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications .
when he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth , his hands moved as if in slow motion .
and as i wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt , fumbling with his buttons .
i realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker-basket chest to me .
it was an offering , an invitation .
i did not decline .
i percussed . i palpated . i listened to the chest .
i think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him .
neither of us could skip this ritual , which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung , or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure .
no , this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients .
although , god knows , of late , in our hubris , we seem to have drifted away .
we seem to have forgotten -- as though , with the explosion of knowledge , the whole human genome mapped out at our feet , we are lulled into inattention , forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician , necessary for the patient -- forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient .
and the message , which i didn 't fully understand then , even as i delivered it , and which i understand better now is this : i will always , always , always be there .
i will see you through this .
i will never abandon you .
i will be with you through the end . "
thank you very much .

michael shermer on strange beliefs
hey , i am michael shermer , the director of the skeptics society , the publisher of " skeptic " magazine .
we investigate claims of the paranormal , pseudo-science , and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between -- science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , bad science , non-science and plain old nonsense .
and unless you 've been on mars recently , you know there 's a lot of that out there .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
but let 's face it -- there 's a lot of bunk , and we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there , flushing out .
well , we 're sort of like the ralph naders of bad ideas -- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas .
i 'll show you an example of a bad idea .
i brought this with me .
this was given to us by nbc dateline to test .
it 's the -- it 's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .
it 's called the quadro 2000 dowser rod .
this was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece .
it 's a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to it .
you could dowse for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students ' lockers .
so the way it works is , you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker .
so it looks something like this .
i 'll show you .
no , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
so , i 'll show -- well , this is science , so we 'll do a controlled experiment .
it 'll go this way for sure .
sir , you want to empty your pockets . please , sir ?
so the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students ' lockers ?
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
but in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits .
and that 's probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astrologers , and tarot card readers and so on .
people remember the hits ; they forget the misses .
in science we have to keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance .
in this case , we tested it .
we had two opaque boxes : one with government-approved thc marijuana , and one with nothing .
and it got it 50 percent of the time --
which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin flip model .
so that 's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
" skeptic " is the quarterly publication .
each one has a particular theme , like this one is on the future of intelligence .
are people getting smarter or dumber ?
i have an opinion of this myself because of the business i 'm in ,
but , in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter .
three iq points per 10 years , going up .
sort of an interesting thing .
with science , don 't think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing .
are science and religion compatible ?
it 's like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
these -- they 're just two different things .
science is not a thing . it 's a verb .
it 's a way of thinking about things .
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
i mean , what 's more likely : that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in farmer bob 's field in puckerbrush , kansas to promote skeptic.com , our webpage ?
or is it more likely that a reader of " skeptic " did this with photoshop ?
and in all cases we have to ask -- what 's the more likely explanation ?
and before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it 's not in this world .
what 's more likely -- that arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ?
or that the " world weekly news " makes stuff up ?
and part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely here in this sidney harris cartoon .
for those of you in the back , it says here : " then a miracle occurs .
i think you need to be more explicit here in step two . "
this single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments .
there 's nothing more to it than that .
you can say a miracle occurs .
it 's just that it doesn 't explain anything .
it doesn 't offer anything . there 's nothing to test .
it 's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
whereas -- and it 's true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that --
until we figure out what it is , we 'll just call it this --
it 's the beginning of the causal chain for science .
for intelligent design creationists , it 's the end of the chain .
so again , we can ask this : what 's more likely ? are ufos alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes -- or even fakes ?
this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena , california , looking down over pasadena .
and if it looks a lot like a buick hubcap , it 's because it is .
you don 't even need photoshop ; you don 't need high-tech equipment ; you don 't need computers .
this was shot with a throwaway kodak instamatic camera .
you just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
camera 's ready -- that 's it .
so , although it 's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it 's more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
on a more serious note , in all of science we 're looking for a balance between data and theory .
in the case of galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .
first of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
and second of all , his data was grainy and fuzzy , and he couldn 't quite make out what it was he was looking at .
so he wrote that he had seen -- " i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . "
and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
so without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you can 't have a good theory .
and it wasn 't solved until 1655 .
this is christiaan huygens 's book in which he cataloged all the mistakes that people made in trying to figure out what was going on with saturn .
it wasn 't till -- huygens had two things .
he had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated .
and then , he had better telescopic , more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the earth is going around faster -- according to kepler 's laws -- than saturn , then we catch up with it .
and we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
the problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases . so one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level .
and then i 'll go to more serious ones .
like , we have a tendency to see faces .
this is the face on mars , which was -- in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by martians .
well , it turns out -- here 's the close-up of it from 2001 .
if you squint , you can still see the face .
and when you 're squinting , what you 're doing is you 're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain .
and so , you 're reducing the quality of your data .
and if i didn 't tell you what to look for , you 'd still see the face , because we 're programmed by evolution to see faces .
faces are important for us socially .
and , of course , happy faces .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
you can see the happy face on mars , there .
if astronomers were frogs perhaps they 'd see kermit the frog .
do you see him there ?
little froggy legs .
or if geologists were elephants ?
religious iconography .
discovered by a tennessee baker in 1996 .
he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from mother teresa 's lawyer .
here 's our lady of guadalupe and our lady of watsonville , just down the street ,
or is it up the street from here ?
tree bark is particularly good because it 's nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals .
here 's the virgin mary on the side of a glass window in sao paulo .
now , here 's the virgin mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which i got to actually hold in a las vegas casino , of course , this being america .
this casino paid 28,500 dollars on ebay for the cheese sandwich .
but who does it really look like , the virgin mary ?
it has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look .
virgin mary in clearwater , florida .
i actually went to see this one .
there was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their -- wheelchairs and crutches , and so on .
and we went down , investigated .
just to give you a size -- that 's dawkins , me and the amazing randi , next to this two , two and a half story size image .
all these candles , so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this .
so we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where -- it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
here 's the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
i guess you can only have one miracle per building .
so is it really a miracle of mary , or is it a miracle of marge ?
and then i 'm going to finish up with another example of this with audio -- auditory illusions .
there is this film , " white noise , " with michael keaton about the dead talking back to us .
by the way , this whole business of talking to the dead , it 's not that big a deal .
anybody can do it , turns out .
it 's getting the dead to talk back that 's the really hard part .
in this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena .
there 's a reversespeech.com web page from which i downloaded this stuff .
here is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these .
here 's the forward version of the very famous song .
boy , couldn 't you just listen to that all day ?
all right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there .
what did you get ?
audience : " satan . " michael shermer : " satan ? " ok , well , at least we got " satan . "
now , i 'll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear , and then hear it again .
you can 't miss it when i tell you what 's there .
all right , i 'm going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization .
we 're always looking for little , good things that people do .
and in england , there 's a pop singer .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
and she wrote a beautiful song .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , " nine million bicycles in beijing . "
it 's a love story -- she 's sort of the norah jones of the u.k. -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth .
and she has this one passage here .
♫ we are 12 billion light-years from the edge ♫ ♫ that 's a guess ♫ ♫ no one can ever say it 's true ♫ ♫ but i know that i will always be with you ♫ well , that 's nice .
at least she got it close . in america it would be , " we 're 6,000 light years from the edge . "
but my friend , simon singh , the particle physicist now turned science educator , and he wrote the book " the big bang , " and so on .
he uses every chance he gets to promote good science .
and so , he wrote an op-ed piece in " the guardian " about katie 's song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
you know , it 's 12 -- it 's 13.7 billion light years , and it 's not a guess .
we know within precise error bars there how close it is .
and so , we can say , although not absolutely true , that it 's pretty close to being true .
and , to his credit , katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out .
and said , " i 'm so embarrassed .
i was a member of the astronomy club , and i should have known better . "
and she re-cut the song .
so i 'll end with the new version .
♫ we are 13.7 billion light years ♫ ♫ from the edge of the observable universe ♫ ♫ that 's a good estimate with well-defined error bars ♫ ♫ and with the available information ♫ ♫ i predict that i will always be with you ♫ how cool is that ?

dean ornish on the world 's killer diet
with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu -- and we 'll hear about that from the brilliant dr. brilliant later today -- i want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . and in one generation , for example , asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . and in africa , cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries .
so there 's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale .
heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it 's completely preventable for almost everybody .
it 's not only preventable ; it 's actually reversible . and for the last almost 29 years , we 've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle , using these very high-tech , expensive , state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography , before and after a year , and cardiac pet scans .
we showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle , and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth , or inhibition of the tumor growth , compared to only nine percent in the control group .
and in the mri and mr spectroscopy here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year .
now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . what 's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . that 's pitiful , and it 's preventable .
now these are not election returns , these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state , beginning in ' 85 , ' 86 , ' 87 -- these are from the cdc website -- ' 88 , ' 89 , ' 90 , ' 91 -- you get a new category -- ' 92 , ' 93 , ' 94 , ' 95 , ' 96 , ' 97 , ' 98 , ' 99 , 2000 , 2001 -- it gets worse . we 're
kind of devolving .
now what can we do about this ? well , you know , the diet that we 've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an asian diet .
but the people in asia are starting to eat like we are , which is why they 're starting to get sick like we are .
so i 've been working with a lot of the big food companies . they can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods , like -- i chair the advisory boards to mcdonald 's , and pepsico , and conagra , and safeway , and soon del monte , and they 're finding that it 's good business .
the salads that you see at mcdonald 's came from the work -- they 're going to have an asian salad . at
pepsi , two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu . thank you .

jane chen : a warm embrace that saves lives
please close your eyes , and open your hands .
now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
now open your eyes .
what about a life ?
what you see here is a premature baby .
he looks like he 's resting peacefully , but in fact he 's struggling to stay alive because he can 't regulate his own body temperature .
this baby is so tiny he doesn 't have enough fat on his body to stay warm .
sadly , 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world .
four million of these babies die annually .
but the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe , long-term health problems .
the reason is because in the first month of a baby 's life , its only job is to grow .
if it 's battling hypothermia , its organs can 't develop normally , resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes , to heart disease , to low i.q .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
that is the primary function of an incubator .
but traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars .
so , you 're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries .
as a result , parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies ' bodies , or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe .
i 've seen this firsthand over and over again .
on one of my first trips to india , i met this young woman , sevitha , who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby , rani .
she took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator .
but that hospital was over four hours away ,
and sevitha didn 't have the means to get there , so her baby died .
inspired by this story , and dozens of other similar stories like this , my team and i realized what was needed was a local solution , something that could work without electricity , that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use , given that the majority of births still take place in the home .
we needed something that was portable , something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost , compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the u.s. costs .
so , this is what we came up with .
what you see here looks nothing like an incubator . it looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
you can open it up completely . it 's waterproof .
there 's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily .
but the magic is in this pouch of wax .
this is a phase-change material .
it 's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees celsius .
you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it 's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply reheat the pouch .
so , you then place it into this little pocket back here , and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby .
looks simple , but we 've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
we plan to launch this product in india in 2010 ,
and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth .
this seems counterintuitive , but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced , population sizes also decrease , because parents don 't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die .
we hope that the embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
in designing this we followed a few basic principles .
we really tried to understand the end user , in this case , people like sevitha .
we tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists .
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
in doing this , i believe we can truly bring technology to the masses .
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an embrace .

seth godin on the tribes we lead
so sometimes i get invited to give weird talks .
i got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events .
unfortunately i couldn 't go .
but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living .
what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events .
shortly after that i got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals .
and again , i couldn 't go . but it 's a fascinating group . they make balloon animals .
there is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals , but --
they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons .
sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
and the other thing about these guys is , they also know what they do for a living .
they make balloon animals .
but what do we do for a living ?
what exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
and i want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything .
that we try to find a piece of the status quo -- something that bothers us , something that needs to be improved , something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it .
we try to make big , permanent , important change .
but we don 't think about it that way .
and we haven 't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like .
and i 've been studying it for a couple years .
and i want to share a couple stories with you today .
first , about a guy named nathan winograd .
nathan was the number two person at the san francisco spca .
and what you may not know about the history of the spca is , it was founded to kill dogs and cats .
cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them .
in a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed , most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street .
nathan and his boss saw this ,
and they could not tolerate it .
so they set out to make san francisco a no-kill city :
create an entire city where every dog and cat , unless it was ill or dangerous , would be adopted , not killed .
and everyone said it was impossible .
nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance . and people from spcas and humane shelters around the country flew to san francisco to testify against them -- to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane .
they persisted . and nathan went directly to the community .
he connected with people who cared about this :
nonprofessionals , people with passion .
and within just a couple years , san francisco became the first no-kill city ,
running no deficit , completely supported by the community .
nathan left and went to tompkins county , new york --
a place as different from san francisco as you can be and still be in the united states . and he did it again .
he went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community .
and then he went to north carolina and did it again .
and he went to reno and he did it again .
and when i think about what nathan did , and when i think about what people here do , i think about ideas .
and i think about the idea that creating an idea , spreading an idea has a lot behind it .
i don 't know if you 've ever been to a jewish wedding ,
but what they do is , they take a light bulb and they smash it .
now there is a bunch of reasons for that , and stories about it .
but one reason is because it indicates a change , from before to after .
it is a moment in time .
and i want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented .
we started with the factory idea :
that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change .
we then went to the tv idea ,
that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece , if you could get on tv enough times , if you could buy enough ads , you could win .
and now we 're in this new model of leadership ,
where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system , but by leading .
so let me tell you about the three cycles . the first one is the factory cycle .
henry ford comes up with a really cool idea .
it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day . because he 's got an efficient enough factory .
well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
you can change the fabric of an entire country .
that the essence of what you 're doing is you need ever-cheaper labor , and ever-faster machines . and the problem we 've run into is , we 're running out of both .
ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines .
so we shift gears for a minute , and say , " i know : television ;
advertising . push push .
take a good idea and push it on the world .
i have a better mousetrap . and if i can just get enough money to tell enough people , i 'll sell enough . "
and you can build an entire industry on that .
if necessary you can put babies in your ads .
if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
and if babies don 't work , you can use doctors .
but be careful . because you don 't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition , where you 're talking about one thing instead of the other .
this model requires you to act like the king , like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back .
that you are in charge , and you 're going to tell people what to do next .
the quick little diagram of it is , you 're up here , and you are pushing it out to the world .
this method -- mass marketing -- requires average ideas , because you 're going to the masses , and plenty of ads .
what we 've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea ,
hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause ,
hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate .
and , unfortunately , it doesn 't work so well anymore either .
but there is good news around the corner -- really good news .
i call it the idea of tribes .
what tribes are , is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years .
it 's about leading and connecting people and ideas .
and it 's something that people have wanted forever .
lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
but now , thanks to the internet , thanks to the explosion of mass media , thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world , tribes are everywhere .
the internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
instead what it 's allowed is silos of interest .
so you 've got the red-hat ladies over here .
you 've got the red-hat triathletes over there .
you 've got the organized armies over here .
you 've got the disorganized rebels over here .
you 've got people in white hats making food .
and people in white hats sailing boats .
the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them ,
because you want to be connected .
that people on the fringes can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking .
now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo .
people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon . and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out .
but they always stop and take a picture .
you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one .
they 've got their own flag . they 've got the eye patches .
you can tell when you 're running into someone in a tribe .
and it turns out that it 's tribes -- not money , not factories -- that can change our world , that can change politics , that can align large numbers of people .
not because you force them to do something against their will ,
but because they wanted to connect .
that what we do for a living now , all of us , i think , is find something worth changing , and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea .
and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves ,
it becomes a movement .
so when al gore set out to change the world again , he didn 't do it by himself .
and he didn 't do it by buying a lot of ads .
he did it by creating a movement .
thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him ,
because he can 't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night .
you don 't need everyone .
what kevin kelley has taught us is you just need , i don 't know , a thousand true fans --
a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round .
and that means that the idea you create , the product you create , the movement you create isn 't for everyone ,
it 's not a mass thing . that 's not what this is about .
what it 's about instead is finding the true believers .
it 's easy to look at what i 've said so far , and say , " wait a minute , i don 't have what it takes to be that kind of leader . "
so here are two leaders . they don 't have a lot in common .
they 're about the same age . but that 's about it .
what they did , though , is each in their own way , created a different way of navigating your way through technology .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team . and some people will get people to be on the other team .
it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services .
you know , this is one of my favorite devices .
but what a shame that it 's not organized to help authors create movements .
what would happen if , when you 're using your kindle , you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment .
or from your book group . or from your friends , or from the circle you want .
what would happen if authors , or people with ideas could use version two , which comes out on monday , and use it to organize people who want to talk about something .
now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechanics here .
but let me just try a couple .
the beatles did not invent teenagers .
they merely decided to lead them .
that most movements , most leadership that we 're doing is about finding a group that 's disconnected but already has a yearning --
not persuading people to want something they don 't have yet .
when diane hatz worked on " the meatrix , " her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn 't invent the idea of being a vegan .
she didn 't invent the idea of caring about this issue .
but she helped organize people , and helped turn it into a movement .
hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
bob marley did not invent rastafarians .
he just stepped up and said , " follow me . "
derek sivers invented cd baby , which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --
to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to , and connect with each other .
what all these people have in common is that they are heretics .
that heretics look at the status quo and say , " this will not stand . i can 't abide this status quo .
i am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward .
i see what the status quo is ; i don 't like it . "
that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them , that instead of being what i call a sheepwalker -- somebody who 's half asleep , following instructions , keeping their head down , fitting in -- every once in a while someone stands up and says , " not me . "
someone stands up and says , " this one is important .
we need to organize around it . "
and not everyone will . but you don 't need everyone .
you just need a few people -- -- who will look at the rules , realize they make no sense , and realize how much they want to be connected .
so tony shea does not run a shoe store .
zappos isn 't a shoe store .
zappos is the one , the only , the best-there-ever-was place for people who are into shoes to find each other , to talk about their passion , to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow .
it can be something as prosaic as shoes , and something as complicated as overthrowing a government .
it 's exactly the same behavior though .
what it requires , as geraldine carter has discovered , is to be able to say , " i can 't do this by myself .
but if i can get other people to join my climb and ride , then together we can get something that we all want .
we 're just waiting for someone to lead us . "
michelle kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
she doesn 't do it by quietly building one house at a time .
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it .
by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other .
by leading a movement and
making change .
and around and around and around it goes .
so three questions i 'd offer you .
the first one is , who exactly are you upsetting ?
because if you 're not upsetting anyone , you 're not changing the status quo .
the second question is , who are you connecting ?
because for a lot of people , that 's what they 're in it for :
the connections that are being made , one to the other .
and the third one is , who are you leading ?
because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you 're building , but the who , and the leading part -- is where change comes .
so blake , at tom 's shoes , had a very simple idea .
" what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn 't even own a pair of shoes ? "
this is not the story of how you get shelf space at neiman marcus .
it 's a story of a product that tells a story .
and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says , " what are those ? "
you get to tell the story on blake 's behalf , on behalf of the people who got the shoes .
and suddenly it 's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes . it 's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
not fighting the organization that 's fighting it -- fighting with them , leading them , connecting them , challenging the status quo because it 's important to him .
and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection .
they need the leadership . it makes a difference .
you don 't need permission from people to lead them .
but in case you do , here it is :
they 're waiting , we 're waiting for you to show us where to go next .
so here is what leaders have in common . the first thing is , they challenge the status quo .
they challenge what 's currently there .
the second thing is , they build a culture .
a secret language , a seven-second handshake ,
a way of knowing that you 're in or out .
they have curiosity . curiosity about people in the tribe ,
curiosity about outsiders . they 're asking questions .
they connect people to one another .
do you know what people want more than anything ?
they want to be missed .
they want to be missed the day they don 't show up .
they want to be missed when they 're gone .
and tribe leaders can do that .
it 's fascinating , because all tribe leaders have charisma ,
but you don 't need charisma to become a leader .
being a leader gives you charisma .
if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded , that 's where charisma comes from -- from the leading .
finally , they commit .
they commit to the cause . they commit to the tribe .
they commit to the people who are there .
so i 'd like you to do something for me .
and i hope you 'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand .
what i want you to do , it only takes 24 hours , is : create a movement .
something that matters . start . do it . we need it .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .

at tedglobal university , shereen el feki shows how some arab cultures are borrowing trademarks of western pop culture -- music videos , comics , even barbie -- and adding a culturally appropriate twist . the hybridized media shows how two civilizations , rather than dividing , can dovetail .

shereen el feki : pop culture in the arab world
hello , everyone . because this is my first time at ted , i 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
yes . that 's right . this is barbie .
she 's 50 years old . and she 's looking as young as ever .
but i 'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face .
this is fulla . fulla is the arab world 's answer to barbie .
now , according to proponents of the clash of civilizations , barbie and fulla occupy these completely separate spheres .
they have different interests . they have divergent values .
and should they ever come in contact ...
well , i 've got to tell you , it 's just not going to be pretty .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
where i work , in the arab region , people are busy taking up western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally western , nor are they traditionally islamic .
i want to show you two examples .
the first is 4shbab .
it means " for youth " and it 's a new arab tv channel .
: video clips from across the globe .
the usa .
♫ i am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ i am not afraid to stand alone , if allah is by my side ♫ ♫ i am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ everything will be all right ♫ ♫ i am not afraid to stand alone ♫ the arab world .
♫ she was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ she was adorned by the light of the quran ♫ shereen el feki : 4shbab has been dubbed islamic mtv .
its creator , who is an egyptian tv producer called ahmed abu haiba , wants young people to be inspired by islam to lead better lives .
he reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos .
4shbab was set up as an alternative to existing arab music channels .
and they look something like this .
that , by the way is haifa wehbe . she 's a lebanese pop star and pan-arab pin-up girl .
in the world of 4shbab , it 's not about bump and grind .
but it 's not about fire and brimstone either .
its videos are intended to show a kinder , gentler face of islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
and it 's called " the 99 . "
now , these are the world 's first islamic superheroes .
they were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif al mutawa .
and his desire is to rescue islam from images of intolerance , all in a child-friendly format .
" the 99 . " the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of allah : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
so , for example , there is the character of noora .
she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .
another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
now , " the 99 " is not just a comic book .
it 's now a theme park .
there is an animated series in the works .
and by this time next year , the likes of superman and wonder woman will have joined forces with " the 99 " to beat injustice wherever they find it .
" the 99 " and 4shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of islamic cross-cultural hybridization .
we 're not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash .
i like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations , in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined .
now , while 4shbab and " the 99 " may look new and shiny , there is actually a very long tradition of this .
throughout its history , islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern .
after all , it 's the quran which encourages us to do this :
" we made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another . "
and to my mind , those are pretty wise words , no matter what your creed . thank you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / esther _ perel _ the _ secret _ to _ desire _ in _ a _ long _ term _ relationship.html
in long-term relationships , we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner . but as esther perel argues , good < em > and < / em > committed sex draws on two conflicting needs : our need for security and our need for surprise . so how do you sustain desire ? with wit and eloquence , perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence .
culture , love , relationships , sex

esther perel : the secret to desire in a long-term relationship
so , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ?
and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex , contrary to popular belief ?
or , the next question would be , can we want what we already have ?
that 's the million-dollar question , right ?
and why is the forbidden so erotic ?
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
and why does sex make babies , and babies spell erotic disaster in couples ?
it 's kind of the fatal erotic blow , isn 't it ?
and when you love , how does it feel ?
and when you desire , how is it different ?
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
so i travel the globe , and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
a crisis of desire , as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality , of our free choice , of our preferences , of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies .
you know , this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term , not because we want 14 children , for which we need to have even more because many of them won 't make it , and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty .
this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire .
so what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
and at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs .
on the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence -- all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home .
but we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure , for novelty , for mystery , for risk , for danger , for the unknown , for the unexpected , surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey , for travel .
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship .
but now we want our partner to still give us all these things , but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot , and we live twice as long .
so we come to one person , and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide : give me belonging , give me identity , give me continuity , but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one .
give me comfort , give me edge .
give me novelty , give me familiarity .
give me predictability , give me surprise .
and we think it 's a given , and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that .
so now we get to the existential reality of the story , right ?
because i think , in some way -- and i 'll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
so if there is a verb , for me , that comes with love , it 's " to have . "
and if there is a verb that comes with desire , it is " to want . "
in love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
we want to minimize the distance . we want to contract that gap .
we want to neutralize the tensions . we want closeness .
but in desire , we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone .
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
in desire , we want an other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district .
in desire , we want a bridge to cross .
or in other words , i sometimes say , fire needs air .
desire needs space .
and when it 's said like that , it 's often quite abstract .
but then i took a question with me .
and i 've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with " mating in captivity , " and i asked people , when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner ?
not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
so the first group is : i am most drawn to my partner when she is away , when we are apart , when we reunite .
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
but then the second group is even more interesting : i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she 's doing something she 's passionate about , when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when i see her hold court .
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn-on across the board .
radiant , as in self-sustaining .
i look at this person -- by the way , in desire people rarely talk about it , when we are blended into one , five centimeters from each other . i don 't know in inches how much that is .
but it 's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them .
it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive .
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic elan , lies that movement toward the other .
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it 's about looking with new eyes .
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me .
and then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it 's the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire .
nobody needs anybody .
there is no caretaking in desire .
caretaking is mightily loving . it 's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them .
wanting them is one thing . needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
for good reasons , right ?
and then the third group of answers usually would be when i 'm surprised , when we laugh together , as somebody said to me in the office today , when he 's in his tux , so i said , you know , it 's either the tux or the cowboy boots .
but basically it 's when there is novelty .
but novelty isn 't about new positions . it isn 't a repertoire of techniques .
novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
what parts of you are just being seen ?
because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do , eh ?
sex is a place you go . it 's a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
so where do you go in sex ?
what parts of you do you connect to ?
what do you seek to express there ?
is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ?
is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
what comes out there ? it 's a language .
it isn 't just a behavior .
and it 's the poetic of that language that i 'm interested in , which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence .
you know , animals have sex .
it 's the pivot , it 's biology , it 's the natural instinct .
we are the only ones who have an erotic life , which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
we are the only ones who can make love for hours , have a blissful time , multiple orgasms , and touch nobody , just because we can imagine it .
we can hint at it . we don 't even have to do it .
we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mortar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it 's happening , to experience it as if it 's happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
so when i began to think about eroticism , i began to think about the poetics of sex , and if i look at it as an intelligence , then it 's something that you cultivate .
what are the ingredients ? imagination , playfulness , novelty , curiosity , mystery .
but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
but more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in , which was a community in belgium , all holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who didn 't die , and those who came back to life .
and those who didn 't die lived often very tethered to the ground , could not experience pleasure , could not trust , because when you 're vigilant , worried , anxious , and insecure , you can 't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative .
those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death .
they knew how to keep themselves alive .
and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with , i sometimes would hear people say , " i want more sex , " but generally people want better sex , and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness , of vibrancy , of renewal , of vitality , of eros , of energy that sex used to afford them , or that they 've hoped it would afford them .
and so i began to ask a different question .
" i shut myself off when ... " began to be the question .
" i turn off my desires when ... " which is not the same question as , " what turns me of is ... " and " you turn me off when ... " and people began to say , " i turn myself off when i feel dead inside , when i don 't like my body , when i feel old , when i haven 't had time for myself , when i haven 't had a chance to even check in with you , when i don 't perform well at work , when i feel low self esteem , when i don 't have a sense of self-worth , when i don 't feel like i have a right to want , to take , to receive pleasure . " and then i began to ask the reverse question .
" i turn myself on when ... " because most of the time , people like to ask the question , " you turn me on , what turns me on , " and i 'm out of the question . you know ?
now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's .
it won 't make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
so i turn myself on when , i turn my desires , i wake up when ...
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire .
because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love : jealousy , possessiveness , aggression , power , dominance , naughtiness , mischief .
basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day .
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this .
but no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don 't always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one 's self in the presence of another .
so i want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that . our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore .
that 's the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
and then at some point they turn around and they look at you , and if you tell them , " hey kiddo , the world 's a great place . go for it .
there 's so much fun out there , " then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time .
they can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back .
but if on this side there is somebody who says , " i 'm worried . i 'm anxious . i 'm depressed .
my partner hasn 't taken care of me in so long .
what 's so good out there ? don 't we have everything you need together , you and i ? " then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
some of us will come back , came back a long time ago , and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other .
i will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
and i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection , and i won 't know how to leave you in order to go play , in order to go experience pleasure , in order to discover , to enter inside myself .
translate this into adult language .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
" are you going to be there ?
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ?
are you going to be angry with me ? " and they may be gone , but they 're never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
because in the beginning , the growing intimacy wasn 't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire .
the more connected i became , the more responsible i felt , the less i was able to let go in your presence .
the third child doesn 't really come back .
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it 's that real dialectic piece .
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
on the other hand if you can 't go , you can 't have pleasure , you can 't culminate , you don 't have an orgasm , you don 't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do .
one , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
they also understand that an erotic space isn 't about , you begin to stroke the other .
it 's about you create a space where you leave management inc . , maybe where you leave the agile program , and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible .
responsibility and desire just butt heads .
they don 't really do well together .
erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
it 's pretty much like the moon . it has intermittent eclipses .
but what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
committed sex is premeditated sex .
it 's willful . it 's intentional .
it 's focus and presence .
merry valentine 's .

david byrne : how architecture helped music evolve
this is the venue where , as a young man , some of the music that i wrote was first performed .
it was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
this is a song that was recorded there .
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .
" by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
the sound system was kind of decent .
and there wasn 't a lot of reverberation in the room .
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville .
the music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
the clientele behavior was very much the same too .
and so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down , shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing .
since then , i 've played other places that are much nicer .
i 've played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that .
and it 's been very exciting .
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written , or was writing at the time , didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls .
we managed , but sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made .
so i asked myself : do i write stuff for specific rooms ?
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ?
is that a kind of model for creativity ?
do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
okay , africa .
most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in west africa .
and the music there , i would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it 's played , the setting , the context , it 's all perfect . it all works perfect .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
it 's no accident .
it 's perfect for that particular context .
and it would be a mess in a context like this . this is a gothic cathedral .
in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
it doesn 't change key , the notes are long ,
there 's almost no rhythm whatsoever ,
and the room flatters the music .
it actually improves it .
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for . this is the organ .
it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
he can , very innovatively , actually change keys without risking huge dissonances .
this is a little bit later .
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in .
i think we 're in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
they 're smaller , even less reverberant , so he can write really frilly music that 's very intricate -- and it works .
it fits the room perfectly .
this is la scala .
it 's around the same time ,
i think it was built around 1776 .
people in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
they used to eat , drink and yell out to people on the stage , just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that .
if they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
and well , that was an opera experience .
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself .
and the size of the room is not that big .
it 's smaller than this .
but wagner made an innovation . he wanted a bigger band .
he wanted a little more bombast ,
so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there .
okay . this is carnegie hall .
obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
the halls got bigger . carnegie hall 's fair-sized .
it 's larger than some of the other symphony halls .
and they 're a lot more reverberant than la scala .
around the same , according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet --
no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
they had to be very quiet .
so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls .
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there weren 't in some of these other kinds of music .
quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting .
but because of the reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall , the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural .
this is mahler .
it looks like bob dylan , but it 's mahler .
that was bob 's last record , yeah .
popular music , coming along at the same time .
this is a jazz band .
according to scott joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
again , it 's noisy . they 're playing for dancers .
there 's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked . and they 'd say , " play that part again . "
well , there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers .
so the bands started to improvise new melodies .
and a new form of music was born .
these are played mainly in small rooms .
people are dancing , shouting and drinking .
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
same thing goes true for -- that 's the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it 's rock or latin music or whatever .
[ live music ] doesn 't really change that much .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
and this was one way that the music got there .
microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
other singers after him went even further .
this is chet baker .
and this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone .
it would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
and he 's singing right into your ear .
he 's whispering into your ears .
the effect is just electric .
it 's like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
so at this point , music diverged .
there 's live music , and there 's recorded music .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
now there 's venues like this , a discotheque , and there 's jukeboxes in bars , where you don 't even need to have a band .
there doesn 't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever ,
and the sound systems are good .
people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems .
and , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
and another new form of music was born .
live performance , when it was incredibly successful , ended up in what is probably , acoustically , the worst sounding venues on the planet : sports stadiums , basketball arenas and hockey arenas .
musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
they wrote what is now called arena rock , which is medium-speed ballads .
they did the best they could given that this is what they 're writing for .
the tempos are medium . it sounds big .
it 's more a social situation than a musical situation .
and in some ways , the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly .
so there 's more new venues .
one of the new ones is the automobile .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
but now that 's evolved into something else .
the car is a whole venue .
the music that , i would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it .
it might not be what you want to listen to at home , but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum , you know , big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle .
automobile music , you can share with your friends .
there 's one other kind of new venue , the private mp3 player .
presumably , this is just for christian music .
and in some ways it 's like carnegie hall , or when the audience had to hush up ,
because you can now hear every single detail .
in other ways , it 's more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
so that doesn 't really work .
i think pop music , mainly , it 's written today , to some extent , is written for these kind of players , for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail , but the dynamic doesn 't change that much .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
and does it happen anywhere else ?
well , according to david attenborough and some other people , birds do it too --
that the birds in the canopy , where the foliage is dense , their calls tend to be high-pitched , short and repetitive .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don 't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
and birds like this savannah sparrow , they tend to have a buzzing type call .
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
the tananger on the east coast of the united states , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call .
so birds do it too .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
yeah . i think it 's evolutionary .
it 's adaptive .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view .
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
and i 'm saying , well , the passion 's still there , but the vessel that it 's going to be injected into and poured into , that is instinctively and intuitively created first .
we already know where that passion is going .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
the writer , thomas frank , says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests , that voters , like a lot of us , assume , that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere , that it 's coming from the gut , that it 's passionate , that it 's more authentic .
and they 'll vote for that .
so that , if somebody can fake sincerity , if they can fake passion , they stand a better chance of being selected in that way , which seems a little dangerous .
i 'm saying the two , the passion , the joy , are not mutually exclusive .
maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds .
we adapt .
we sing .
and like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
thank you very much .

speaking at ted in 1998 , rev. billy graham marvels at technology 's power to improve lives and change the world -- but says the end of evil , suffering and death will come only after the world accepts christ . a legendary talk from ted 's archives .

billy graham on technology and faith
as a clergyman , you can imagine how out of place i feel .
i feel like a fish out of water , or maybe an owl out of the air .
i was preaching in san jose some time ago , and my friend mark kvamme , who helped introduce me to this conference , brought several ceos and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me , or i with them .
and i was so stimulated .
and had such -- it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
i know that we 're near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion .
richard can answer that , because he made that decision .
but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia , coming down .
i was to address a conference at a hotel .
and on that elevator a man said , " i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel . " and another man looked in my direction and said , " yes , there he is . he 's on this elevator with us . " and this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds , and he said , " my , what an anticlimax ! " i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax , after all these tremendous talks that you 've heard , but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago , and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte , north carolina .
his name was john belk . some of you will probably know him .
and there was a drunk man on there , and he got up out of his seat two or three times , and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do . and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by , and everybody was upset with him .
and finally , john belk said , " do you know who 's sitting here ? " and the man said , " no , who ? " he said , " it 's billy graham , the preacher . "
he said , " you don 't say ! " and he turned to me , and he said , " put her there ! "
he said , " your sermons have certainly helped me . " and i suppose that that 's true with thousands of people . i know that as you have been peering into the future , and as we 've heard some of it here tonight , i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be .
but i won 't , because i 'm 80 years old . this is my eightieth year , and i know that my time is brief .
i have phlebitis at the moment , in both legs , and that 's the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here , because i have parkinson 's disease in addition to that , and some other problems that i won 't talk about .
but this is not the first time that we 've had a technological revolution .
we 've had others .
and there 's one that i want to talk about .
in one generation , the nation of the people of israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the near east .
a man by the name of david came to the throne , and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation .
he was a man of tremendous leadership .
he had the favor of god with him .
he was a brilliant poet , philosopher , writer , soldier -- with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today .
but about two centuries before david , the hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron , and , slowly , that skill spread .
but they wouldn 't allow the israelis to look into it , or to have any .
but david changed all of that , and he introduced the iron age to israel .
and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron , and which archaeologists have found , that in present-day palestine , there are evidences of that generation .
now , instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones , israel now had iron plows , and sickles , and hoes and military weapons .
and in the course of one generation , israel was completely changed .
the introduction of iron , in some ways , had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation .
and david found that there were many problems that technology could not solve .
there were many problems still left .
and they 're still with us , and you haven 't solved them , and i haven 't heard anybody here speak to that .
how do we solve these three problems
that i 'd like to mention ?
the first one that david saw was human evil .
where does it come from ?
how do we solve it ?
over again and again in the psalms , which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world , david describes the evils of the human race .
and yet he says , " he restores my soul . " have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are ?
on one hand , we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology , as this conference vividly demonstrates .
we 've seen under the sea , three miles down , or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future .
but on the other hand , something is wrong .
our battleships , our soldiers , are on a frontier now , almost ready to go to war with iraq .
now , what causes this ?
why do we have these wars in every generation , and in every part of the world ?
and revolutions ?
we can 't get along with other people , even in our own families .
we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can 't break .
racism and injustice and violence sweep our world , bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death .
even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle .
i would like to see oracle take up that , or some other technological geniuses work on this .
how do we change man , so that he doesn 't lie and cheat , and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever ?
the bible says the problem is within us , within our hearts and our souls .
our problem is that we are separated from our creator , which we call god , and we need to have our souls restored , something only god can do .
jesus said , " for out of the heart come evil thoughts : murders , sexual immorality , theft , false testimonies , slander . " the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man , but he said , " it 's in our hearts that the evil lies , and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out . " albert einstein -- i was just talking to someone , when i was speaking at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
he didn 't have a doctor 's degree , because he said nobody was qualified to give him one .
but he made this statement .
he said , " it 's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man . " and many of you , i 'm sure , have thought about that and puzzled over it .
you 've seen people take beneficial technological advances , such as the internet we 've heard about tonight , and twist them into something corrupting .
you 've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems .
the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology , horribly used .
the problem is not technology .
the problem is the person or persons using it .
king david said that he knew the depths of his own soul .
he couldn 't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery .
yet king david sought god 's forgiveness , and said , " you can restore my soul . " you see , the bible teaches that we 're more than a body and a mind .
we are a soul .
and there 's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding .
that 's the part of us that yearns for god , or something more than we find in technology .
your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life , and which seeks for something beyond this life .
it 's the part of you that yearns , really , for god .
i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something .
they don 't know what it is . i speak at many universities , and i have many questions and answer periods , and whether it 's cambridge , or harvard , or oxford -- i 've spoken at all of those universities .
i 'm going to harvard in about three or four -- no , it 's about two months from now -- to give a lecture .
and i 'll be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times i 've been there .
and it 'll be on these questions : where did i come from ? why am i here ? where am i going ?
what 's life all about ? why am i here ?
even if you have no religious belief , there are times when you wonder that there 's something else .
thomas edison also said , " when you see everything that happens in the world of science , and in the working of the universe , you cannot deny that there 's a captain on the bridge . " i remember once , i sat beside mrs. gorbachev at a white house dinner .
i went to ambassador dobrynin , whom i knew very well . and i 'd been to russia several times under the communists , and they 'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn 't expect .
and i knew mr. dobrynin very well , and i said , " i 'm going to sit beside mrs. gorbachev tonight .
what shall i talk to her about ? " and he surprised me with the answer .
he said , " talk to her about religion and philosophy .
that 's what she 's really interested in . " i was a little bit surprised , but that evening that 's what we talked about , and it was a stimulating conversation . and afterward , she said , " you know , i 'm an atheist , but i know that there 's something up there higher than we are . " the second problem that king david realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering .
writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , " man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . " yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
but i 'm -- in a few months , i 'll be 80 years of age .
i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years .
my doctors at the mayo clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here .
i haven 't given a talk in nearly four months .
and when you speak as much as i do , three or four times a day , you get rusty .
that 's the reason i 'm using this podium and using these notes .
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere , i 'm not reading . i never read an address .
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
i talk ad lib .
but tonight , i 've got some notes here so that if i begin to forget , which i do sometimes , i 've got something i can turn to .
but even here among us , most -- in the most advanced society in the world , we have poverty .
we have families that self-destruct , friends that betray us .
unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
i 've never met a person in the world or a worry .
why do we suffer ? it 's an age-old question that we haven 't answered .
yet david again and again said that he would turn to god .
he said , " the lord is my shepherd . " the final problem that david knew he could not solve was death .
many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation .
most people live as if they 're never going to die .
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
we see people on our screens .
marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person , and our -- many young people think she 's still alive .
they don 't know that she 's dead .
or clark gable , or whoever it is .
the old stars , they come to life .
and they 're -- they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person .
but death is inevitable .
i spoke some time ago to a joint session of congress , last year .
and we were meeting in that room , the statue room . about 300 of them were there .
and i said , " there 's one thing that we have in common in this room , all of us together , whether republican or democrat , or whoever . " i said , " we 're all going to die . and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us . "
and it 's often difficult for young people to understand that .
it 's difficult for them to understand that they 're going to die .
as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote , he said , there 's every activity under heaven .
there 's a time to be born , and there 's a time to die .
i 've stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
i 've talked to them .
i 've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death .
and yet , a few years earlier , death never crossed their mind .
i talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor .
she said he never thought of god , never talked about god , didn 't believe in god . he was an atheist .
but she said , as he came to die , he sat up on the side of the bed one day , and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain .
and he said , for the first time in his life he 'd thought about the inevitable , and about god .
was there a god ?
a few years ago , a university student asked me , " what is the greatest surprise in your life ? " and i said , " the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life .
it passes so fast . "
but it does not need to have to be that way .
wernher von braun , in the aftermath of world war ii concluded , quote : " science and religion are not antagonists .
on the contrary , they 're sisters . " he put it on a personal basis .
i knew dr. von braun very well .
and he said , " speaking for myself , i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator . "
he also said , " in our search to know god , i 've come to believe that the life of jesus christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration .
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind . " i 've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it 's been my privilege to speak in .
and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer , who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany , since the war .
and he once -- and he said to me , he said , " young man . " he said , " do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ ? " and i said , " sir , i do . " he said , " so do i. " he said , " when i leave office , i 'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again , and why it 's so important to believe that . " in one of his plays , alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying , who says to those gathered around his bed , " the moment when it 's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying . " how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying ?
blaise pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century france .
pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics , even as a teenager .
he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory , and a creator of the first model of a computer .
and of course , you are all familiar with the computer language named for him .
pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil , suffering and death .
he was astounded at the phenomenon we 've been considering : that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science , the arts and human enterprise , yet they also are full of anger , hypocrisy and have -- and self-hatreds .
pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion .
on november 23 , 1654 , pascal had a profound religious experience .
he wrote in his journal these words : " i submit myself , absolutely , to jesus christ , my redeemer . " a french historian said , two centuries later , " seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of jesus christ . " pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony , but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven , and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven .
he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason .
it was he who penned the well-known words , " the heart has its reasons , which reason knows not of . " equally well known is pascal 's wager .
essentially , he said this : " if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you 're wrong .
but if instead you bet that there is no god , then you can lose it all , in this life and the life to come . " for pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of god .
the knowledge of god was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind .
he was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39 .
king david lived to be 70 , a long time in his era .
yet he too had to face death , and he wrote these words : " even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death , i will fear no evil , for you are with me . " this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil , suffering and death .
it can be yours , as well , as you seek the living god and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future .
when i was 17 years of age , i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina .
i milked cows every morning , and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school . and there were 20 of them that i had -- that i was responsible for , and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies .
i didn 't make good grades in high school .
i didn 't make them in college , until something happened in my heart .
one day , i was faced face-to-face with christ .
he said , " i am the way , the truth and the life . " can you imagine that ? " i am the truth .
i 'm the embodiment of all truth . " he was a liar .
or he was insane .
or he was what he claimed to be .
which was he ?
i had to make that decision .
i couldn 't prove it .
i couldn 't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .
but by faith i said , i believe him , and he came into my heart and changed my life .
and now i 'm ready , when i hear that call , to go into the presence of god .
thank you , and god bless all of you .
thank you for the privilege . it was great .

suheir hammad : poems of war , peace , women , power
" what i will " i will not dance to your war drum .
i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
i will not dance to that beating .
i know that beat .
it is lifeless .
i know intimately that skin you are hitting .
it was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
i will not dance to your drummed-up war .
i will not pop , spin , break for you .
i will not hate for you or even hate you .
i will not kill for you .
especially i will not die for you .
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
i will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
everyone can be wrong .
life is a right , not collateral or casual .
i will not forget where i come from .
i will craft my own drum .
gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
our humming will be drumming .
i will not be played .
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
i will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
this heartbeat is louder than death .
your war drum ain 't louder than this breath . haaa .
what 's up ted people ? let me hear you make some noise .
a bunch of pacifists .
confused , aspiring pacifists .
i understand .
i 've been wrong a lot lately .
like a lot .
so i couldn 't figure out what to read today .
i mean , i 've been saying i 've been prepping .
what that means is prepping my outfit , prepping options , trying to figure out what i 'm coming behind and going in front of .
poetry does that .
it preps you . it aims you .
so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
but i 'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
hold her now with you .
you don 't need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
are you holding her ?
this is " break clustered . " all holy history banned .
unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
but my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man 's creative violence .
whose son shall it be ?
which male child will perish a new day ?
our boys ' deaths galvanize .
we cherish corpses .
we mourn women , complicated .
bitches get beat daily .
profits made , prophets ignored .
war and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
all colors run , none of us solid .
don 't look for shadow behind me . i carry it within .
i live cycles of light and darkness .
rhythm is half silence .
i see now , i never was one and not the other .
sickness , health , tender violence .
i think now i never was pure .
before form i was storm , blind , ign 'ant -- still am .
human contracted itself blind , malignant .
i never was pure .
girl spoiled before ripened .
language can 't math me .
i experience exponentially .
everything is everything .
one woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
one woman loses six .
one woman loses her head .
one woman searches rubble . one woman feeds on trash .
one woman shoots her face . one woman shoots her husband .
one woman straps herself .
one woman gives birth to a baby .
one woman gives birth to borders .
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
one woman never did .
where do refugee hearts go ?
broken , dissed , placed where they 're not from , don 't want to be missed .
faced with absence .
we mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
my spine curves spiral .
precipice running to and running from human beings .
cluster bombs left behind .
de facto landmines .
a smoldering grief .
harvest contaminated tobacco .
harvest bombs .
harvest baby teeth . harvest palms , smoke .
harvest witness , smoke .
resolutions , smoke .
salvation , smoke .
redemption , smoke .
breathe .
do not fear what has blown up .
if you must , fear the unexploded . thank you .

leymah gbowee : unlock the intelligence , passion , greatness of girls
many times i go around the world to speak , and people ask me questions about the challenges , my moments , some of my regrets .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
i went to northern liberia .
and as part of the work , the village would give you lodgings .
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .
this girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade .
she was the laughing stock of the community .
her mother was often told by other women , " you and your child will die poor . " after two weeks of working in that village , it was time to go back .
the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , " leymah , take my daughter .
i wish for her to be a nurse . " dirt poor , living in the home with my parents , i couldn 't afford to .
with tears in my eyes , i said , " no . " two months later , i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief .
the women 's chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
and all day she walked around only in her underwear .
when i asked , " who is that ? "
she said , " that 's wei .
the meaning of her name is pig .
her mother died while giving birth to her , and no one had any idea who her father was . "
for two weeks , she became my companion , slept with me .
i bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll .
the night before i left , she came to the room and said , " leymah , don 't leave me here .
i wish to go with you .
i wish to go to school . " dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , i again said , " no . " two months later , both of those villages fell into another war .
till today , i have no idea where those two girls are .
fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , " leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you .
i want you to bring her home because we don 't have safe homes . " the story of this little girl : she had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months .
she came to me bloated , very pale .
every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor .
she 'd lie beside me and say , " auntie , i wish to be well .
i wish to go to school . " 2010 : a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
she 's 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
she 's highly athletic .
one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship . full scholarship . she gets it .
her dream of going to school , her wish of being educated , is finally here .
she goes to school on the first day .
the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
and for the next three years , her fate will be having sex with him every day , as a favor for getting her in school .
globally , we have policies , international instruments , work leaders .
great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear .
the u.n. has the convention on the rights of the child .
countries like america , we 've heard things like no child left behind .
other countries come with different things .
there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls .
all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally , i think , has failed .
in liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
teen prostitution is at its peak .
in one community , we 're told , you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper .
girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night .
it 's disheartening , it 's sad .
and then someone asked me , just before my tedtalk , a few days ago , " so where is the hope ? "
several years ago , a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .
it 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls ' kids are totally out there and no hope , or seemingly no hope .
we created a space called the young girls transformative project .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
when these girls sit , you unlock intelligence , you unlock passion , you unlock commitment , you unlock focus , you unlock great leaders .
today , we 've worked with over 300 .
and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps , as young mothers , to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women .
one young woman i met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
one day she said to me , " my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . " she 's at a place where she can 't find money to go to school .
she sells water , sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones .
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
juanita is her name .
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school .
says , " leymah , my wish is to be educated .
and if i can 't be educated , when i see some of my sisters being educated , my wish has been fulfilled .
i wish for a better life .
i wish for food for my children .
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . " this is the dream of the african girl .
several years ago , there was one african girl .
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry .
angry , frustrated , really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children , this young girl started a movement , a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace .
i will fulfill the wish .
this is another african girl 's wish .
i failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls .
i failed to do this .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- i failed , i failed , i failed .
so i will do this .
women came out , protested a brutal dictator , fearlessly spoke .
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true , the wish of peace came true .
this young woman wished also to go to school .
she went to school .
this young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her .
today , this young woman is me , a nobel laureate .
i 'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish , in my tiny capacity , of little african girls -- the wish of being educated .
we set up a foundation .
we 're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential .
i don 't have much to ask of you .
i 've also been to places in this u.s. , and i know that girls in this country also have wishes , a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx , a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l.a. , a wish for a better life somewhere in texas , a wish for a better life somewhere in new york , a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey .
will you journey with me to help that girl , be it an african girl or an american girl or a japanese girl , fulfill her wish , fulfill her dream , achieve that dream ?
because all of these great innovators and inventors that we 've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world , and all they 're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence , unlock the passion , unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves .
let 's journey together . let 's journey together .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you so much .
right now in liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?
lg : i 've been asked to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative .
as part of my work , i 'm doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13 , 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that i 've gone into that i haven 't seen intelligent girls .
but sadly , the vision of a great future , or the dream of a great future , is just a dream , because you have all of these vices .
teen pregnancy , like i said , is epidemic .
so what troubles me is that i was at that place and somehow i 'm at this place , and i just don 't want to be the only one at this place .
i 'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there 's another liberian girl , ghanaian girl , nigerian girl , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
and maybe , just maybe , saying , " because of that nobel laureate i 'm here today . " so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope .
but i 'm also not pessimistic , because i know it doesn 't take a lot to get them charged up .
ca : and in the last year , tell us one hopeful thing that you 've seen happening .
lg : i can tell you many hopeful things that i 've seen happening .
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
and we could not find 25 girls in high school .
all of these girls went to the gold mine , and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things .
we took 50 of those girls and we worked with them .
and this was at the beginning of elections .
this is one place where women were never -- even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men .
these girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration .
this is a real rural village .
and the theme they used was : " even pretty girls vote . "
they were able to mobilize young women .
but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , " what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? " and one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric .
rape is not barbaric , but the law , he said , was barbaric .
and when the girls started engaging him , he was very hostile towards them .
these little girls turned to him and said , " we will vote you out of office . "
he 's out of office today .
ca : leymah , thank you . thank you so much for coming to ted .
lg : you 're welcome .

nigel marsh : how to make work-life balance work
what i thought i would do is i would start with a simple request .
i 'd like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
now that was the advice that st. benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned 40 .
up until that moment , i had been that classic corporate warrior -- i was eating too much , i was drinking too much , i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family .
and i decided that i would try and turn my life around .
in particular , i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance .
so i stepped back from the workforce , and i spent a year at home with my wife and four young children .
but all i learned about work-life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn 't have any work .
not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
so i went back to work , and i 've spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
and i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today .
the first is : if society 's to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate .
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
all the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue , which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family .
now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're in .
and the reality of the society that we 're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like .
it 's my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and [ a ] t-shirt isn 't really getting to the nub of the issue .
the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren 't going to solve this issue for us .
we should stop looking outside . it 's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead .
if you don 't design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
it 's particularly important -- this isn 't on the world wide web , is it ? i 'm about to get fired -- it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation .
now i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the " abattoirs of the human soul , " as i call them .
i 'm talking about all companies .
because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [ as ] they can get away with .
it 's in their nature ; it 's in their dna ; it 's what they do -- even the good , well-intentioned companies .
on the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
on the other hand , it 's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office .
we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .
before i went back to work after my year at home , i sat down and i wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired to .
and it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep .
have sex .
walk the dog .
have breakfast with my wife and children .
have sex again .
drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
do three hours ' work .
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
do another three hours ' work .
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
meditate for half an hour .
have sex .
walk the dog . have sex again .
go to bed .
how often do you think i have that day ?
we need to be realistic .
you can 't do it all in one day .
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the " i 'll have a life when i retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , i 've got no mates or interests left . " a day is too short ; " after i retire " is too long .
there 's got to be a middle way .
a fourth observation : we need to approach balance in a balanced way .
a friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn 't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said , " nigel , i 've read your book .
and i realize that my life is completely out of balance .
it 's totally dominated by work .
i work 10 hours a day ; i commute two hours a day .
all of my relationships have failed .
there 's nothing in my life apart from my work .
so i 've decided to get a grip and sort it out .
so i joined a gym . " now i don 't mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn 't more balanced ; it 's more fit .
lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life --
there 's the intellectual side ; there 's the emotional side ; there 's the spiritual side .
and to be balanced , i believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches .
now that can be daunting .
because people say , " bloody hell mate , i haven 't got time to get fit . you want me to go to church and call my mother . " and i understand .
i truly understand how that can be daunting .
but an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
my wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , " nigel , you need to pick our youngest son " -- harry -- " up from school . " because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
we walked down to the local park , messed around on the swings , played some silly games .
i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas .
i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's " james and the giant peach . "
i then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , " goodnight , mate , " and walked out of his bedroom .
as i was walking out of his bedroom , he said , " dad ? " i went , " yes , mate ? " he went , " dad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . " i hadn 't done anything , hadn 't taken him to disney world or bought him a playstation .
now my point is the small things matter .
being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
with the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
moreover , i think , it can transform society .
because if enough people do it , we can change society 's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spreading .

majora carter : greening the ghetto
if you 're here today -- and i 'm very happy that you are -- you 've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves . however , when we 're not at ted , we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible ,
especially in large , urban areas like new york city .
and that 's because most people with decision-making powers , in both the public and the private sector , really don 't feel as though they 're in danger .
the reason why i 'm here today , in part , is because of a dog : an abandoned puppy i found back in the rain , back in 1998 .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i 'd anticipated .
when she came into my life , we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the east river waterfront , despite the fact that our small part of new york city already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city 's commercial waste :
a sewage treatment pelletizing plant , a sewage sludge plant , four power plants , the world 's largest food distribution center , as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week . the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , i thought they were really well-meaning , but a bit naive .
i 'd lived in this area all my life , and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that i 'd mentioned earlier . then , while jogging with my dog one morning , she pulled me into what i thought was just another illegal dump .
there were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that i won 't mention here , but she kept dragging me -- and lo and behold , at the end of that lot was the river .
i knew that this forgotten little street-end , abandoned like the dog that brought me there , was worth saving .
and i knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new south bronx .
and just like my new dog , it was an idea that got bigger than i 'd imagined . we garnered much support along the way .
and the hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront park that the south bronx had had in more than 60 years .
we leveraged that $ 10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $ 3 million park .
and , in the fall , i 'm actually going to -- i exchange marriage vows with my beloved . thank you very much .
that 's him pressing my buttons back there , which he does all the time .
but those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine . we feel the problems right now , and have for some time .
environmental justice , for those of you who may not be familiar with the term , goes something like this : no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other .
unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities .
as a black person in america , i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health .
i am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which i do .
these land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity , diabetes and asthma .
why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ?
our 27 percent obesity rate is high , even for this country , and diabetes comes with it .
one out of four south bronx children has asthma .
our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average .
these impacts are coming everyone 's way .
and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs , health problems associated with pollution and more odiously , the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men , who possess untold amounts of untapped potential .
50 percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line .
25 percent of us are unemployed . low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care .
this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits .
poor people are not only still poor ; they are still unhealthy .
fortunately , there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won 't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term , and won 't destroy us all in the long term .
none of us want that , and we all have that in common . so what else do we have in common ?
well , first of all , we 're all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school , college , post-graduate degrees , traveled to interesting places , didn 't have kids in your early teens ,
financially stable , never been imprisoned . ok .
good .
but , besides being a black woman , i am different from most of you in some other ways .
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down .
my big brother lenny fought in vietnam , only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home .
jesus . i grew up with a crack house across the street .
yeah , i 'm a poor black child from the ghetto .
these things make me different from you .
but the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and i am in between these two worlds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other .
so how did things get so different for us ?
in the late ' 40s , my dad -- a pullman porter , son of a slave -- bought a house in the hunts point section of the south bronx , and a few years later he married my mom .
at the time , the community was a mostly white , working-class neighborhood .
my dad was not alone .
and as others like him pursued their own version of the american dream , white flight became common in the south bronx and in many cities around the country .
red-lining was used by banks , wherein certain sections of the city , including ours , were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment .
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
hunts point was formerly a walk-to-work community , but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to .
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
in new york state , robert moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign .
one of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in westchester county to go to manhattan .
the south bronx , which lies in between , did not stand a chance .
residents were often given less than a month 's notice before their buildings were razed .
600,000 people were displaced .
the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx .
and if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ?
so now , my family 's property was worthless , save for that it was our home and all we had .
and luckily for me , that home and the love inside of it , along with help from teachers , mentors and friends along the way , was enough .
now , why is this story important ?
because from a planning perspective , economic degradation begets environmental degradation , which begets social degradation .
the disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come .
antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood .
are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?
what costs are associated with these decisions ? and who pays ?
who profits ? does anything justify what the local community goes through ?
this was " planning " -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind .
once we realized that , we decided it was time to do our own planning .
that small park i told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the south bronx .
i wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths .
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don 't compromise a community 's quality of life .
they provide opportunities to be more physically active , as well as local economic development .
think bike shops , juice stands .
we secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
this is lafayette avenue -- and as redesigned by matthews-nielsen landscape architects .
and once this path is constructed , it 'll connect the south bronx with more than 400 acres of randall 's island park .
right now we 're separated by about 25 feet of water , but this link will change that .
as we nurture the natural environment , its abundance will give us back even more .
we run a project called the bronx ecological stewardship training , which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations , so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs .
little by little , we 're seeding the area with green collar jobs -- then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment .
the sheridan expressway is an underutilized relic of the robert moses era , built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it .
even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
the community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway .
we have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland , affordable housing and local economic development .
we also built the city 's -- new york city 's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices .
cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don 't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere .
green roofs are soil and living plants .
both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat , contribute to urban " heat island " effect and degrade under the sun , which we in turn breathe . green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall , so they reduce a city 's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which , incidentally , are often located in environmental justice communities like mine .
and they provide habitats for our little friends !
so -- -- so cool !
anyway , the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business , bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the south bronx .
i like that , too .
anyway , i know chris told us not to do pitches up here , but since i have all of your attention : we need investors . end of pitch .
it 's better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
anyway -- ok . katrina . prior to katrina , the south bronx and new orleans ' ninth ward had a lot in common . both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another .
in the post-katrina era , we have still more in common .
we 're at best ignored and maligned and abused , at worst , by negligent regulatory agencies , pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability .
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable .
but we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out .
we are more than simply national symbols of urban blight . or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone .
now will we let the gulf coast languish for a decade or two like the south bronx did ?
or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine ?
now listen , i do not expect individuals , corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral .
this presentation today only represents some of what i 've been through , like a tiny little bit . you 've no clue .
but i 'll tell you later if you want to know .
but -- i know it 's the bottom line , or one 's perception of it , that motivates people in the end .
i 'm interested in what i like to call the " triple bottom line " that sustainable development can produce .
developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned : the developers , government and the community where these projects go up .
at present , that 's not happening in new york city .
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
a parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the south bronx , but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic , pollution , solid waste and the impacts on open space . and their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it 's not even funny .
because on top of that , the world 's richest sports team is replacing the house that ruth built by destroying two well-loved community parks .
now , we 'll have even less than that stat i told you about earlier .
and although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars , these projects include thousands of new parking spaces , yet zip in terms of mass public transit .
now , what 's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy , environmentally challenged community , versus incorporating structural , sustainable changes .
my agency is working closely with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues .
now let 's get this straight . i am not anti-development .
ours is a city , not a wilderness preserve . and i 've embraced my inner capitalist .
you probably all have it , and if you haven 't , you need to .
so i don 't have a problem with developers making money .
there 's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable , community-friendly development can still make a fortune .
fellow tedsters bill mcdonough and amory lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that .
i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .
that it continues is a shame upon us all , because we are all responsible for the future that we create .
but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .
this is my version of globalization .
let 's take bogota . poor , latino , surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking : a reputation not unlike that of the south bronx .
however , this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named enrique penalosa .
he looked at the demographics .
few bogatanos own cars , yet a huge portion of the city 's resources was dedicated to serving them .
if you 're a mayor , you can do something about that .
his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three , outlawed parking on those streets , expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes , created public plazas , created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .
for his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
people stopped littering ; crime rates dropped --
because the streets were alive with people .
his administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time , and on a third-world budget at that .
we have no excuse in this country . i 'm sorry .
but the bottom line is : their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars , but rather to provide opportunities for all bogatanos to participate in the city 's resurgence . that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the us .
but bogota 's example has the power to change that . you , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
that 's why you 're here and why you value the information we exchange .
use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
don 't just talk about it at ted . this is a nationwide policy agenda i 'm trying to build , and as you all know , politics are personal .
help me make green the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations .
help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere .
oh good , glad i have a little more time !
listen -- when i spoke to mr. gore the other day after breakfast , i asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy .
his response was a grant program .
i don 't think he understood that i wasn 't asking for funding .
i was making him an offer .
what troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
now , don 't get me wrong , we need money .
but grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don 't add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count .
i have come from so far to meet you like this .
please don 't waste me . by working together , we can become one of those small , rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world .
we might have come to this conference from very , very different stations in life , but believe me , we all share one incredibly powerful thing : we have nothing to lose and everything to gain .
ciao bellos !

hans rosling 's new insights on poverty
i told you three things last year .
i told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available .
because of that , we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries , which is wrong .
and that animated graphics can make a difference .
things are changing
and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
and if i could share the image with you on the screen .
so three things have happened .
u.n. opened their statistic databases , and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net , so you don 't have to download it any longer . and let me repeat what you saw last year .
the bubbles are the countries .
here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman -- and there you have the length of life in years .
this is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries , those were developing countries .
at that time there was a " we " and " them . "
there was a huge difference in the world .
but then it changed , and it went on quite well .
and this is what happens .
you can see how china is the red , big bubble . the blue there is india .
a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed .
and it 's africa that stands out as the problem down here , doesn 't it ?
large families still , and the hiv epidemic brought down the countries like this .
this is more or less what we saw last year , and this is how it will go on into the future .
and i will talk on , is this possible ?
because you see now , i presented statistics that don 't exist .
because this is where we are .
will it be possible that this will happen ?
i cover my lifetime here , you know ?
i expect to live 100 years .
and this is where we are today .
now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world ?
and i would like to show that against child survival .
we 'll swap the axis . here you have child mortality -- that is , survival -- four kids dying there , 200 dying there .
and this is gdp per capita on this axis .
and this was 2007 .
and if i go back in time , i 've added some historical statistics -- here we go , here we go , here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago .
some countries still had statistics .
we are looking down in the archive , and when we are down into 1820 , there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers .
but they were down here . they had 1,000 dollars per person per year .
and they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world . how they got slowly richer and richer , and they add statistics .
isn 't it beautiful when they get statistics ?
you see the importance of that ?
and here , children don 't live longer .
the last century , 1870 , was bad for the kids in europe , because most of this statistics is europe .
it was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year .
this is india coming up , with the first data from india .
and this is the united states moving away here , earning more money .
and we will soon see china coming up in the very far end corner here .
and it moves up with mao tse-tung getting health , not getting so rich .
there he died , then deng xiaoping brings money . it moves this way over here .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
let us have a look at the united states .
we have a function here -- i can tell the world , " stay where you are . " and i take the united states -- we still want to see the background -- i put them up like this , and now we go backwards .
and we can see that the united states goes to the right of the mainstream .
they are on the money side all the time .
and down in 1915 , the united states was a neighbor of india -- present , contemporary india .
and that means united states was richer , but lost more kids than india is doing today , proportionally .
and look here -- compare to the philippines of today .
the philippines of today has almost the same economy as the united states during the first world war .
but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines .
about 1957 here , the health of the united states is the same as the philippines .
and this is the drama of this world which many call globalized , is that asia , arabic countries , latin america , are much more ahead in being healthy , educated , having human resources than they are economically .
there 's a discrepancy in what 's happening today in the emerging economies .
there now , social benefits , social progress , are going ahead of economical progress .
and 1957 -- the united states had the same economy as chile has today .
and how long do we have to bring united states to get the same health as chile has today ?
i think we have to go , there -- we have 2001 , or 2002 -- the united states has the same health as chile .
chile 's catching up !
within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states .
this is really a change , that you have this lag of more or less 30 , 40 years ' difference on the health .
and behind the health is the educational level .
and there 's a lot of infrastructure things , and general human resources are there .
now we can take away this -- and i would like to show you the rate of speed , the rate of change , how fast they have gone .
and we go back to 1920 , and i want to look at japan .
and i want to look at sweden and the united states .
and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the red toyota down there , and the brownish volvo . and here we go . here we go .
the toyota has a very bad start down here , you can see , and the united states ford is going off-road there .
and the volvo is doing quite fine .
this is the war . the toyota got off track , and now the toyota is coming on the healthier side of sweden -- can you see that ?
and they are taking over sweden , and they are now healthier than sweden .
that 's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota .
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
they really caught up .
and this changes gradually .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
and let me show you my own sort of family history -- we made these graphs here .
and this is the same thing , money down there , and health , you know ?
and this is my family .
this is sweden , 1830 , when my great-great-grandma was born .
sweden was like sierra leone today .
and this is when great-grandma was born , 1863 .
and sweden was like mozambique .
and this is when my grandma was born , 1891 .
she took care of me as a child , so i 'm not talking about statistic now -- now it 's oral history in my family .
that 's when i believe statistics , when it 's grandma-verified statistics .
i think it 's the best way of verifying historical statistics .
sweden was like ghana .
it 's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-saharan africa .
i told you last year , i 'll tell you again , my mother was born in egypt , and i -- who am i ?
i 'm the mexican in the family .
and my daughter , she was born in chile , and the grand-daughter was born in singapore , now the healthiest country on this earth .
it bypassed sweden about two to three years ago , with better child survival .
but they 're very small , you know ?
they 're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests .
but homage to singapore .
singapore is the best one .
now this looks also like a very good story .
but it 's not really that easy , that it 's all a good story .
because i have to show you one of the other facilities .
we can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am i choosing here ?
carbon-dioxide emission , metric ton per capita .
this is 1962 , and united states was emitting 16 tons per person .
and china was emitting 0.6 , and india was emitting 0.32 tons per capita .
and what happens when we moved on ?
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier --
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
there is no one who has done it so far .
and we don 't have all the updated data any longer , because this is really hot data today .
and there we are , 2001 .
and in the discussion i attended with global leaders , you know , many say now the problem is that the emerging economies , they are getting out too much carbon dioxide .
the minister of the environment of india said , " well , you were the one who caused the problem . "
the oecd countries -- the high-income countries -- they were the ones who caused the climate change .
" but we forgive you , because you didn 't know it .
but from now on , we count per capita .
from now on we count per capita .
and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission . " this really shows you , we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate .
and this is really what has to be changed .
i 've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world , but i don 't think it 's like this .
the world is quite a messy place .
this we can call dollar street .
everyone lives on this street here .
what they earn here -- what number they live on -- is how much they earn per day .
this family earns about one dollar per day .
we drive up the street here , we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day .
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street , and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day .
and how do they live ?
if we look at the bed here , we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor .
this is what poverty line is -- 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs , the food for the day .
this is two to five dollars . you have a bed .
and here it 's a much nicer bedroom , you can see .
i lectured on this for ikea , and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here .
and this is the sofa , how it will emerge from there .
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo panorama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there . although there is a sofa ,
if you watch in the kitchen , you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars .
it comes beyond here , when you really can get good working conditions in the family .
and if you really want to see the difference , you look at the toilet over here .
this can change . this can change .
these are all pictures and images from africa , and it can become much better .
we can get out of poverty .
my own research has not been in it or anything like this .
i spent 20 years in interviews with african farmers who were on the verge of famine .
and this is the result of the farmers-needs research .
the nice thing here is that you can 't see who are the researchers in this picture .
that 's when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
when you 're in poverty , everything is about survival .
it 's about having food .
and these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from hiv and aids -- they discuss with a trained agronomist .
this is one of the best agronomists in malawi , junatambe kumbira , and he 's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant -- the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found .
and they are very , very eagerly interested to get advice , and that 's to survive in poverty .
that 's one context .
getting out of poverty .
the women told us one thing . " get us technology .
we hate this mortar , to stand hours and hours .
get us a mill so that we can mill our flour , then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves . " technology will bring you out of poverty , but there 's a need for a market to get away from poverty .
and this woman is very happy now , bringing her products to the market .
but she 's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count , and won 't be cheated when she reaches the market .
she wants her kid to be healthy , so she can go to the market and doesn 't have to stay home .
and she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road .
it 's also good with credit .
micro-credits gave her the bicycle , you know .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
you can do this .
i find my experience from 20 years of africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible .
africa has not done bad .
in 50 years they 've gone from a pre-medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago europe , with a functioning nation and state .
i would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .
because we don 't consider where they came from .
it 's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , argentina and mozambique together 50 years ago , and says that mozambique did worse .
we have to know a little more about the world .
i have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine .
he knows everything .
he knows the name of the grape , the temperature and everything .
i only know two types of wine -- red and white .
but my neighbor only knows two types of countries -- industrialized and developing .
and i know 200 , i know about the small data .
but you can do that .
but i have to get serious . and how do you get serious ?
you make a powerpoint , you know ?
homage to the office package , no ?
what is this , what is this , what am i telling ?
i 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
everyone wants your pet thing .
if you are in the corporate sector , you love micro-credit .
if you are fighting in a non-governmental organization , you love equity between gender .
or if you are a teacher , you 'll love unesco , and so on .
on the global level , we have to have more than our own thing .
we need everything .
all these things are important for development , especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare .
now , what we need to think about is , what is a goal for development , and what are the means for development ?
let me first grade what are the most important means .
economic growth to me , as a public-health professor , is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival .
governance . to have a government which functions -- that 's what brought california out of the misery of 1850 .
it was the government that made law function finally .
education , human resources are important .
health is also important , but not that much as a mean .
environment is important .
human rights is also important , but it just gets one cross .
now what about goals ? where are we going toward ?
we are not interested in money .
money is not a goal .
it 's the best mean , but i give it zero as a goal .
governance , well it 's fun to vote in a little thing , but it 's not a goal .
and going to school , that 's not a goal , it 's a mean .
health i give two points . i mean it 's nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here , you 're healthy .
and that 's good , it gets two plusses .
environment is very , very crucial .
there 's nothing for the grandkid if you don 't save up .
but where are the important goals ?
of course , it 's human rights .
human rights is the goal , but it 's not that strong of a mean for achieving development .
and culture . culture is the most important thing , i would say , because that 's what brings joy to life .
that 's the value of living .
so the seemingly impossible is possible .
even african countries can achieve this .
and i 've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible .
and remember , please remember my main message , which is this : the seemingly impossible is possible .
we can have a good world .
i showed you the shots , i proved it in the powerpoint , and i think i will convince you also by culture .
bring me my sword !
sword swallowing is from ancient india .
it 's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .
and i will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel -- this is the army bayonet from the swedish army , 1850 , in the last year we had war .
and it 's all solid steel -- you can hear here .
and i 'm going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?

chris bangle says great cars are art
what i want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
this is actually quite meaningful to me , because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don 't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art .
and so cars , as art , brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a .
now at this point you 're going to see a picture of michelangelo .
this is completely different than automobiles .
automobiles are self-moving things , right ? elevators are automobiles .
and they 're not very emotional ; they solve a purpose ; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways ; they 've also been a real pain in the ass ,
because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve .
we have to solve the pollution , we have to solve the congestion -- but that 's not what interests me in this speech .
what interests me in this speech is cars . automobiles may be what you use , but cars are what we are , in many ways .
and as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles , and i believe we can , with fuel cells or hydrogen , like bmw is really hip on , and lots of other things , then i think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means , what we can learn from it .
that 's what i want to get to . cars are not a suit of clothes ; cars are an avatar . cars are an expansion of yourself : they take your thoughts , your ideas , your emotions , and they multiply it -- your anger , whatever . it 's an avatar .
it 's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of , and if you feel sexy , the car is sexy . and if you 're full of road rage , you 've got a " chevy : like a rock , " right ?
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?
that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand .
many people think , " well , it 's computers , and it 's done by machines and stuff like that . "
well , they reproduce it , but the originals are all done by hand .
it 's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft .
and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum .
that tension between the need to express , the need to discover , then you put something new into it , and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship .
rules that say , this is how you handle surfaces ; this is what control is all about ; this is how you show you 're a master of your craft .
and that tension , that discovery , that push for something new -- and at the same time , that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that 's as strong in cars as it is in anything .
we work in clay , which hasn 't changed much since michelangelo started screwing around with it , and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too .
real quickly -- michelangelo once said he 's there to " discover the figure within , " ok ?
there we go , the automobile .
that was 100 years right there -- did you catch that ?
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot didn 't it ?
ok , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .
i want to talk about this .
why it means you have to wash a car , what is it , that sensuality you have to touch about it ? that 's the sculpture that goes into it . that sensuality .
and it 's done by men and women working just like this , making cars .
now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore , i believe that that " pressure within " that moore 's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean .
it 's that will to live , that need to survive , to express itself , that comes in a car , and takes over people like me .
and we tell other people , " do this , do this , do this , " until this thing comes alive .
we are completely infected . and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness ; it 's quite wonderful .
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it 's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars .
and it 's not a whole lot different , really , when they 're working like this , or when somebody works like this .
it 's that same kind of commitment , that same kind of beauty .
now , now i get to the point . i want to talk about cars as art .
art , in the platonic sense , is truth ; it 's beauty , and love .
now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers .
we don 't really have a problem talking about love .
we don 't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense .
that 's what we 're searching for -- when we 're working our craft , we are really trying to find that truth out there .
we 're not trying to find vanity and beauty .
we 're trying to find the beauty in the truth .
however , engineers tend to look at things a little bit more newtonian , instead of this quantum approach .
we 're dealing with irrationalisms , and we 're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist , and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four , and if you get 4.0 it 's better , and 4.000 is even better .
and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we 're doing what we 're doing .
we 've pretty much accepted the fact , though , that we are the women in the organization at bmw -- bmw is a very manly type business , -- men , men , men ; it 's engineers .
and we 're kind of the female side to that . that 's ok , that 's cool . you go off and be manly . we 're going to be a little bit more female .
because what we 're interested in is finding form that 's more than just a function .
we 're interested in finding beauty that 's more than just an aesthetic ; it 's really a truth .
and i think this idea of soul , as being at the heart of great cars , is very applicable . you all know it . you know a car when you 've seen it , with soul . you know how strong this is .
well , this experience of love , and the experience of design , to me , are interchangeable . and now i 'm coming to my story .
i discovered something about love and design through a project called deep blue .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word " love " out of a lot of things in our society , put the word " design " in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
you can understand that . it works in truisms .
" all is fair in design and war . "
certainly we live in a competitive society .
i think this one here , there 's a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
toothbrush , cool .
it really only gets serious when you look at something like this . ok ?
this is one substitution that i believe all of us , in design management , are guilty of .
and this idea that there is more to love , more to design , when it gets down to your neighbor , your other , it can be physical like this , and maybe in the future it will be .
but right now it 's in dealing with our own people , our own teams who are doing the creating . so , to my story .
the idea of people-work is what we work with here , and i have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating bmws .
we have to have a shared intimacy , a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family ; we have to understand ourselves that way .
there 's good times ; there 's interesting times ; and there 's some stress times too .
you want to do cars , you 've got to go outside .
you 've got to do cars in the rain ; you 've got to do cars in the snow .
that 's , by the way , is a presentation we made to our board of directors .
we haul their butts out in the snow , too . you want to know cars outside ?
well , you 've got to stand outside to do this .
and because these are artists , they have very artistic temperaments .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is discovering yourself through your art . right ?
and one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like pygmalion , we are completely in love with our own creations .
this is one of my favorite paintings , it really describes our relationship with cars .
this is sick beyond belief .
but because of this , the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension , a new meaning .
we have a shared center ; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships .
and it 's my job , in the competitive process , to narrow this down .
i heard today about joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .
you know , that 's what i have to do sometimes .
we start out with 10 cars ; we narrow it down to five cars , down to three cars , down to two cars , down to one car , and i 'm in the middle of that killing , basically .
someone 's love , someone 's baby .
this is very difficult , and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this , because their life is wrapped up in that too .
they 've got that gene infected in them as well , and they want that to live , more than anything else .
well , this project , deep blue , put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected , and i want to pass it on to you , because i want you to reflect on this , perhaps in your own relationships .
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for bmw .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it , that i only had a phone number that connected me to them .
so , what we did was : instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist , we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what 's the successor to the suv phenomenon in america .
this is 1996 we did this project . and so we sent them off with this team name , deep blue . now many people know deep blue from ibm -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they 'd think we 're talking about computers .
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue , in a company like bmw , has a hook -- " deep blue , " wow , cool name .
so people get wrapped up in it . and we took a team of designers , and we sent them off to america . and we gave them a budget , what we thought was a set of deliverables , a timetable , and nothing else .
like i said , i just had a phone number that connected me to them .
and a group of engineers worked in germany , and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what 's the successor to the suv . they would come together , compare notes . then they would work apart , come together , and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn 't pollute each other 's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
they disappeared , quite honestly , and all i got was postcards .
now , i got some postcards of these guys in las vegas , and i got some postcards of these guys in the grand canyon , and i got these postcards of niagara falls , and pretty soon they 're in new york , and i don 't know where else .
and i 'm telling myself , " this is going to be a great car , they 're doing research that i 've never even thought about before . " right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven apartments , it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylor 's ex-house in malibu .
and -- at least they told me it was her house , i guess it was at one time , she had a party there or something .
but anyway , this was the house , and they all lived there .
now this is 24 / 7 living , half-a-dozen people who 'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind , and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america , but the first three months were the most intensive .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the bathroom .
the bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
on the other hand , i didn 't know anything about this . ok ?
nothing . this is all going on , and all i 'm getting is postcards of these guys in las vegas , or whatever , saying , " don 't worry chris , this is really going to be good . " ok ?
so my concept of what a design studio was probably -- i wasn 't up to speed on where these guys were .
however , the engineers back in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution , and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin , and , you know , these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer .
and one was hoping that these two teams would get together , and this collusion of incredible creativity , under these incredible surroundings , and these incredibly stressed-out engineers , would create some incredible solutions .
well , what i didn 't know was , and what we found out was -- these guys , they can 't even like talk to each other under those conditions .
you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point , you have a split in your dialog that is so deep , and so far , that they cannot bring this together at all .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in tiburon , which is just up the road from here -- you know tiburon ?
and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to dr. goschel -- who is now my boss , and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results .
we would see where we were going , we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america .
and so i had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
i mean , i 'm going to see so much work , it 's so intense -- i know probably las vegas meant a lot about it , and i 'm not really sure where the grand canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together , and i 'm going to see some really great product .
so we went to tiburon , after three months , and the team had gotten together the week before , many days ahead of time .
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
well , it turns out that the engineers hadn 't done anything .
and they hadn 't done anything because -- kind of , like in car business , engineers are there to solve problems , and we were asking them to create a problem .
and the engineers were waiting for the designers to say , " this is the problem that we 've created , now help us solve it . "
and they couldn 't talk about it . so what happened was , the engineers showed up with nothing .
and the engineers told the designers , " if you go in with all your stuff , we 'll walk out , we 'll walk right out of the project . " so i didn 't know any of this , and we got a presentation that had an agenda , looked like this .
there was a whole lot of dialog .
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .
and here i 'm expecting at any moment , " ok , they 're going to turn the page , and i 'm going to see the cars , i 'm going to see the sketches , i 'm going to see maybe some idea of where it 's going . "
dialog kept on going , with mental maps of words , and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance , i was seriously being baffled with bullshit .
and if you can imagine what this is like , to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working , and they 're out there spending all this money , and they 're learning , and they 're doing all this stuff .
i went fucking ballistic , right ? i went nuts .
you can probably remember tiburon , it used to look like this .
after four hours of this , i stood up , and i took this team apart .
i screamed at them , i yelled at them , " what the hell are you doing ?
you 're letting me down , you 're my designers , you 're supposed to be the creative ones , what the hell is going on around here ? " it was probably one of my better tirades , i have some good ones , but this was probably one of my better ones . and i went into these people ; how could they take bmw 's money , how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
because of course they didn 't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings , model concepts , pictures -- everything i wanted , they 'd locked up in the cars , because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they 'd decided not to show me anything , in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start , because they hadn 't realized , of course , that they couldn 't do problem creating .
so we went to lunch -- and i 've got to tell you , this was one seriously quiet lunch .
the engineers all sat at one end of the table , the designers and i sat at the other end of the table , really quiet .
and i was just fucking furious , furious . ok ?
probably because they had all the fun and i didn 't , you know .
that 's what you get furious about right ?
and somebody asked me about catherine , my wife , you know , did she fly out with me or something ?
i said , " no , " and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife .
and i recalled that when catherine and i were married , the priest gave a very nice sermon , and he said something very important .
he said , " love is not selfish , " he said , " love does not mean counting how many times i say , ' i love you . '
it doesn 't mean you had sex this many times this month , and it 's two times less than last month , so that means you don 't love me as much .
love is not selfish . " and i thought about this , and i thought , " you know , i 'm not showing love here . i 'm seriously not showing love .
i 'm in the air , i 'm in the air without trust .
this cannot be . this cannot be that i 'm expecting a certain number of sketches , and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team .
this cannot be . " so i told them this story . i said , " guys , i 'm thinking about something here , this isn 't right . i can 't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one .
based on a dictate premise that says , ' i 'm a boss , you do what i say , without trust . ' "
i said " this can 't be . "
actually , we all broke down into tears , to be quite honest about it , because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them , not being able to show me what i wanted , and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come .
and i think we felt much closer that day , we cut a lot of strings that didn 't need to be there , and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we put the car back at the center of our thoughts , and we put love , i think , truly back into the center of the process .
by the way , that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after suvs in america .
one of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs , the x coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that .
it was the rendition of our motorcycle , the gs , as carl magnusson says , " brute-iful , " as the idea of what could be a motorcycle , if you add two more wheels .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that i wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . i 'm also going to steal a little quote out of " little prince . "
there 's a lot to be said about trust and love , if you know that those two words are synonymous for design .
i had a very , very meaningful relationship with my team that day , and it 's stayed that way ever since .
and i hope that you too find that there 's more to design , and more towards the art of the design , than doing it yourself .
it 's true that the trust and the love , that makes it worthwhile .
thanks so much .

jay bradner : open-source cancer research
i moved to boston 10 years ago , from chicago , with an interest in cancer and in chemistry .
you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules -- or to my taste , new drugs for cancer .
and you might also know that , for science and medicine , boston is a bit of a candy store .
you can 't roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student .
the bar is called the miracle of science .
the billboards say " lab space available . "
and it 's fair to say that in these 10 years , we 've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution -- that of genome medicine .
we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before .
and we 're able , finally , to answer the question that 's been so pressing for so many years : why do i have cancer ?
this information is also pretty staggering .
you might know that , so far in just the dawn of this revolution , we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes , and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers , causes of cancer .
yet comparatively , we have about a dozen targeted medications .
and this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
we didn 't fly him to boston .
we didn 't sequence his genome .
it 's been known for decades what causes this malignancy .
it 's three proteins -- ras , myc and p53 .
this is old information we 've known since about the 80s , yet there 's no medicine i can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer .
there 's no ras , no myc , no p53 drug .
and you might fairly ask : why is that ?
and the very unsatisfying , yet scientific , answer is it 's too hard .
that for whatever reason , these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that 's called the undruggable genome -- which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable .
it 's a horrible term of trade .
but what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins , into which we , like molecular locksmiths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug substance .
now as i was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation , what we had instead , cascading through the regulatory network at the fda , were these substances -- arsenic , thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas .
and this is the 21st century .
and so , i guess you 'd say , dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines , i went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open-source , the crowd-source , the collaborative network that we have access to within academia , that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients .
and so please consider this a work in progress , but i 'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma , about the protein target , the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer , called brd4 , and about a molecule developed at my lab at dana farber cancer institute called jq1 , which we affectionately named for jun qi , the chemist that made this molecule .
now brd4 is an interesting protein .
you might ask yourself , with all the things cancer 's trying to do to kill our patient , how does it remember it 's cancer ?
when it winds up its genome , divides into two cells and unwinds again , why does it not turn into an eye , into a liver , as it has all the genes necessary to do this ?
it remembers that it 's cancer .
and the reason is that cancer , like every cell in the body , places little molecular bookmarks , that remind the cell " i 'm cancer ; i should keep growing . "
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
so we developed an idea , a rationale , that perhaps , if we made a molecule that prevented the post-it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein , then maybe we could convince cancer cells , certainly those addicted to this brd4 protein , that they 're not cancer .
and so we started to work on this problem .
we developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called jq1 .
now not being a drug company , we could do certain things , we had certain flexibilities , that i respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn 't have .
we just started mailing it to our friends .
i have a small lab .
we thought we 'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves .
and we sent it to oxford , england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture , which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target .
it 's what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity , or hand in glove .
now this is a very rare cancer , this brd4-addicted cancer .
and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham women 's hospital .
and as we treated these cells with this molecule , we observed something really striking .
the cancer cells , small , round and rapidly dividing , grew these arms and extensions .
they were changing shape .
in effect , the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
this got us very excited .
the next step would be to put this molecule into mice .
the only problem was there 's no mouse model of this rare cancer .
and so at the time that we were doing this research , i was caring for a 29 year-old firefighter from connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer .
this brd4-addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung , and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris .
and every nursing shift we would throw this material out .
and so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us .
could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug ?
well that would be impossible and , rightly , illegal to do in humans .
and he obliged us .
at the lurie family center for animal imaging , my colleague , andrew kung , grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic .
and you can see this pet scan of a mouse -- what we call a pet pet .
the cancer is growing as this red , huge mass in the hind limb of this animal .
and as we treat it with our compound , this addiction to sugar , this rapid growth , faded .
and on the animal on the right , you see that the cancer was responding .
we 've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
and every time , we see the same thing .
the mice with this cancer that get the drug live , and the ones that don 't rapidly perish .
so we started to wonder , what would a drug company do at this point ?
well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance .
and so we did just the opposite .
we published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage .
we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule , typically a secret in our discipline .
we told people exactly how to make it .
we gave them our email address , suggesting that , if they write us , we 'll send them a free molecule .
we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
because now when we 've shared this molecule , just since december of last year , with 40 laboratories in the united states and 30 more in europe -- many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space , to target this rare cancer that , thankfully right now , is quite desirable to study in that industry .
but the science that 's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .
leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells .
mice with multiple myeloma , an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow , respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug .
you might know that fat has memory .
nice to be able to demonstrate that for you .
and in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem .
what this research taught us -- not just my lab , but our institute , and harvard medical school more generally -- is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery -- that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other , never made one of its own .
for all the reasons you see listed here , we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest , conceptually-tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery .
so what next ?
we have this molecule , but it 's not a pill yet .
it 's not orally available .
we need to fix it , so that we can deliver it to our patients .
and everyone in the lab , especially following the interaction with these patients , feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule .
it 's here where i have to say that we could use your help and your insights , your collaborative participation .
unlike a drug company , we don 't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into .
we don 't have a team of salespeople and marketeers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other .
what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent , motivated , enthusiastic , hopefully well-funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide .
this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called tensha therapeutics .
and really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery , two of which -- a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin , an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma -- will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in july of this year .
for us , a major and exciting milestone .
i want to leave you with just two ideas .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it 's less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted , i suppose , or twittered worldwide , is the chemical identity of our pro compound .
it 's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies , the information on how these early prototype drugs might work .
yet this information is largely a secret .
and so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles : that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly , responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer .
now the business model involves all of you .
this research is funded by the public .
it 's funded by foundations .
and one thing i 've learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and i love that .
you bike across the state . you walk up and down the river .
i 've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research .
and so i want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas .

sean carroll : distant time and the hint of a multiverse
the universe is really big .
we live in a galaxy , the milky way galaxy .
there are about a hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy .
and if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the hubble space telescope , it will see something like this .
every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our milky way -- a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
there are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
the age of the universe , between now and the big bang , is a hundred billion in dog years .
which tells you something about our place in the universe .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it .
it 's extremely beautiful .
i 've often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn 't have any .
but we would also like to understand it .
as a cosmologist , i want to ask , why is the universe like this ?
one big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you .
and if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster .
so we say the universe is expanding .
what that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
in the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter .
if you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up .
that kind of makes sense to us .
the thing that doesn 't make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , near the big bang , was also very , very smooth .
you might think that that 's not a surprise .
the air in this room is very smooth .
you might say , " well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . "
but the conditions near the big bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room .
in particular , things were a lot denser .
the gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the big bang .
what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each .
at early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big -- literally -- at early times .
and you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole .
keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it 's a delicate arrangement .
it 's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
there is something that made it that way .
we would like to know what .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .
and boltzmann 's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
you 've heard of entropy .
it 's the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems .
boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is .
and it 's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don 't notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same .
if you have the air in this room , you don 't notice each individual atom .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there 's only a few arrangements that look that way .
a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
this is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics -- the law that says that entropy increases in the universe , or in some isolated bit of the universe .
the reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
that 's a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out .
this insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what 's behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future .
every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing -- the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future .
the fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that 's because entropy is increasing .
boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it 's very natural for it to increase because there 's more ways to be high entropy .
what he didn 't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
the fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very , very smooth .
we 'd like to understand that .
that 's our job as cosmologists .
unfortunately , it 's actually not a problem that we 've been giving enough attention to .
it 's not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , " what are the problems we 're trying to address ? "
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .
50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures .
he gave the popular lectures that became " the character of physical law . " he gave lectures to caltech undergrads that became " the feynman lectures on physics . " he gave lectures to caltech graduate students that became " the feynman lectures on gravitation . " in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?
so he says -- i 'm not going to do the accent -- he says , " for some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased .
the arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding . "
so that 's our job .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , " surely , " you 're thinking , " we 've figured it out by now . "
it 's not true that we 've figured it out by now .
the reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn 't know before .
we learned that it 's accelerating .
the universe is not only expanding .
if you look at the galaxy , it 's moving away .
if you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster .
individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster
so we say the universe is accelerating .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don 't know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that 's the theory of dark energy .
it 's just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
in every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there 's stuff , whether or not there 's particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there 's still energy , even in the space itself .
and this energy , according to einstein , exerts a push on the universe .
it is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands .
the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
this has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
back when i was your age , we didn 't know what the universe was going to do .
some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
einstein was fond of this idea .
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
14 billion years in the past , 100 billion dog years , but an infinite number of years into the future .
meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us .
space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see .
there 's a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
so even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
finally , empty space has a temperature .
in the 1970s , stephen hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it 's black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics .
the curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates .
a precisely similar calculation by hawking and gary gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space , then the whole universe radiates .
the energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
and so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
so what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever .
well what is the implication of that ?
that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
but that 's a probabilistic statement .
it will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
it 's not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us .
it 's very , very unlikely .
except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen .
everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained .
so boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
he didn 't know about the big bang . he didn 't know about the expansion of the universe .
he thought that space and time were explained by isaac newton -- they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
so his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules .
but if you 're boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
and then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back .
so it 's not that entropy must always increase -- you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations .
well if that 's true , boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle .
he says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can 't live there .
remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
we would not be able to process information , metabolize , walk and talk , if we lived in thermal equilibrium .
so if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .
so boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
that 's the region where entropy is low .
maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means .
carl sagan once famously said that " in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . " but he was not right .
in boltzmann 's scenario , if you want to make an apple pie , you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie .
that will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie .
so this scenario makes predictions .
and the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our memories , but our impression that outside there 's something called caltech and the united states and the milky way galaxy , it 's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into caltech , the united states and the galaxy .
the good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right .
this scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
and feynman also understood this .
feynman says , " from the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we 've never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we 've just looked at -- high entropy .
if our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it .
we therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . "
so that 's good . the question is then what is the right answer ?
if the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?
and i would love to tell you the answer , but i 'm running out of time .
here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
i just showed you this picture .
the universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
it 's cooling off .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
if the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning .
they will fall into black holes .
we will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes .
that universe will last 10 to the 100 years -- a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
the future is much longer than the past .
but even black holes don 't last forever .
they will evaporate , and we will be left with nothing but empty space .
that empty space lasts essentially forever . however , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there 's actually thermal fluctuations , and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
so even though the universe lasts forever , there 's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe .
they all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years . so here 's two questions for you .
number one : if the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years ,
why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the big bang ?
why aren 't we in empty space ?
you might say , " well there 's nothing there to be living , "
but that 's not right .
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
why aren 't you ?
more homework assignment for you .
so like i said , i don 't actually know the answer .
i 'm going to give you my favorite scenario .
either it 's just like that . there is no explanation .
this is a brute fact about the universe
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
an egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , " hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . "
that 's because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken .
maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .
if that 's true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
that 's my favorite scenario .
so the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .
and 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .
we will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse .
and even better , we will understand what happened at the big bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations .
this is a prediction . i might be wrong .
but we 've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years .
it 's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
thank you .

william kamkwamba : how i harnessed the wind
thank you .
two years ago , i stood on the ted stage in arusha , tanzania .
i spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
it was a simple machine that changed my life .
before that time , i had never been away from my home in malawi .
i had never used a computer .
i had never seen an internet .
on the stage that day , i was so nervous .
my english lost ,
i wanted to vomit .
i had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people .
there was a story i wouldn 't tell you then .
but well , i 'm feeling good right now .
i would like to share that story today .
we have seven children in my family .
all sisters , excepting me .
this is me with my dad when i was a little boy .
before i discovered the wonders of science , i was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
like everyone else , we grew maize .
one year our fortune turned very bad .
in 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
within five months all malawians began to starve to death .
my family ate one meal per day , at night .
only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
the food passes through our bodies .
we drop down to nothing .
in malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
because of the hunger , i was forced to drop out of school .
i looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
it was the future i couldn 't accept .
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school ,
so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
so i went to a library .
i read books , science books , especially physics .
i couldn 't read english that well .
i used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
another book put that knowledge in my hands .
it said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
pump water meant irrigation ,
a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
so i decided i would build one windmill for myself .
but i didn 't have materials to use ,
so i went to a scrap yard where i found my materials .
many people , including my mother , said i was crazy .
i found a tractor fan , shock absorber , pvc pipes .
using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , i built my machine .
it was one light at first .
and then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
another machine pumps water for irrigation .
queues of people start lining up at my house to charge their mobile phone .
i could not get rid of them .
and the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called ted .
i had never seen an airplane before .
i had never slept in a hotel .
so , on stage that day in arusha , my english lost , i said something like , " i tried . and i made it . "
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams . god bless .
maybe one day you will watch this on the internet .
i say to you , trust yourself and believe .
whatever happens , don 't give up .
thank you .

pranav mistry : the thrilling potential of sixthsense technology
we grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
unlike most of our computing devices , these objects are much more fun to use .
when you talk about objects , one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing , and that is gestures : how we manipulate these objects , how we use these objects in everyday life .
we use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other .
a gesture of " namaste ! , " maybe , to respect someone , or maybe --
in india i don 't need to teach a kid that this means " four runs " in cricket .
it comes as a part of our everyday learning .
so , i am very interested , from the beginning , that how --
how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures , and how we use these objects , can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world .
rather than using a keyboard and mouse , why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world ?
so , i started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
most of you might be aware that , in those days , the mouse used to come with a ball inside , and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving , and , accordingly , where the mouse is moving .
so , i was interested in these two rollers , and i actually wanted more , so i borrowed another mouse from a friend --
never returned to him --
and i now had four rollers .
interestingly , what i did with these rollers is , basically , i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line .
it had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
because i was interested in integrating these two worlds , i thought of sticky notes .
i thought , " why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world ? "
a message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms , or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar --
a to-do list that automatically syncs with you .
but you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , " what is dr. smith 's address ? "
and this small system actually prints it out --
so it actually acts like a paper input-output system , just made out of paper .
in another exploration , i thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions .
so , i implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions , but they can actually draw so that it 's more intuitive to use that way .
then i thought , " why not make a google map , but in the physical world ? "
rather than typing a keyword to find something , i put my objects on top of it .
if i put a boarding pass , it will show me where the flight gate is .
a coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup .
so , these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly .
among all these experiments , there was one thing in common : i was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world .
i was taking some part of the objects , or any of the intuitiveness of real life , and bringing them to the digital world , because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive .
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
what we are interested in is information .
we want to know about things .
we want to know about dynamic things going around .
so i thought , around last year -- in the beginning of the last year --
i started thinking , " why can i not take this approach in the reverse way ? "
maybe , " how about i take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information ? "
because pixels are actually , right now , confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets .
why can i not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects , everyday life so that i don 't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels ?
so , in order to realize this dream , i actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head .
i think that 's why this is called a head-mounted projector , isn 't it ?
i took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely .
so now , what i can do --
i can augment the world around me with this digital information .
but later , i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels , also .
so i put a small camera over there , that acts as a digital eye .
later , we moved to a much better , consumer-oriented pendant version of that , that many of you now know as the sixthsense device .
but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go .
you can start using any surface , any wall around you , as an interface .
the camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
whatever you 're doing with your hands , it 's understanding that gesture .
and , actually , if you see , there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it .
you can start painting on any wall .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
but we are not only tracking one finger , here .
we are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands , so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present .
the camera is actually doing --
just , getting all the images --
is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside .
so , technically , it 's a little bit complex , but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use , in some sense .
but i 'm more excited that you can actually take it outside .
rather than getting your camera out of your pocket , you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .
thank you .
and later i can find a wall , anywhere , and start browsing those photos or maybe , " ok , i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend . "
so , we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world .
and , of course , if you don 't have any surface , you can start using your palm for simple operations .
here , i 'm dialing a phone number just using my hand .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
what we 're doing here is actually --
for example , in this case , the book cover is matched with so many thousands , or maybe millions of books online , and checking out which book it is .
once it has that information , it finds out more reviews about that , or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that , so you can actually hear , on a physical book , a review as sound .
this was obama 's visit last week to mit .
so , i was seeing the live [ video ] of his talk , outside , on just a newspaper .
your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated -- like , you have to check your computer in order to do that , right ?
when i 'm going back , i can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed , because at that particular time , i 'm not feeling like opening my iphone , and checking out a particular icon .
and i think this technology will not only change the way --
yes .
it will change the way we interact with people , also , not only the physical world .
the fun part is , i 'm going to the boston metro , and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground , right ?
and i think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life .
but many of you argue , actually , that all of our work is not only about physical objects .
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ?
and many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market .
so , rather than waiting for that , i actually made my own , just using a piece of paper .
so , what i did here is remove the camera --
all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .
i removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that --
like i just made a clip out of the microphone --
and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper .
but the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
you can of course watch movies .
( " good afternoon . my name is russell ... and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54 . " ) and you can of course play games .
here , the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game .
many of you already must have thought , ok , you can browse .
yeah . of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it .
so , more interestingly , i 'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way .
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
paper world is interesting to play with .
here , i 'm taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place --
and i 'm actually modifying the information that i have over there .
yeah . and i say , " ok , this looks nice , let me print it out , that thing . "
so i now have a print-out of that thing , and now --
the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back , rather than now switching between these two worlds .
so , as a last thought , i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide , the gap between these two worlds , but will also help us , in some way , to stay human , to be more connected to our physical world .
and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines .
that 's all . thank you .
thank you .
chris anderson : so , pranav , first of all , you 're a genius .
this is incredible , really .
what are you doing with this ? is there a company being planned ?
or is this research forever , or what ?
pranav mistry : so , there are lots of companies -- actually sponsor companies of media lab --
interested in taking this ahead in one or another way .
companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the ngos in india , [ who ] are thinking , " why can we only have ' sixth sense ' ?
we should have a ' fifth sense ' for missing-sense people who cannot speak .
this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system . "
ca : what are your own plans ? are you staying at mit , or are you going to do something with this ?
pm : i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device , because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own .
we will provide all the open source software for them , maybe starting next month .
ca : open source ? wow .
ca : are you going to come back to india with some of this , at some point ?
pm : yeah . yes , yes , of course .
ca : what are your plans ? mit ?
india ? how are you going to split your time going forward ?
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india .
and now , if you see , it 's more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that .
or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5,000 ?
so , we actually -- i showed that , at a conference , to president abdul kalam , at that time , and then he said , " ok , we should use this in bhabha atomic research centre for some use of that . "
so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment .
ca : based on the people we 've seen at ted , i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now .
it 's an honor to have you at ted .
thank you so much .
that 's fantastic .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / denis _ dutton _ a _ darwinian _ theory _ of _ beauty.html
ted collaborates with animator andrew park to illustrate denis dutton 's provocative theory on beauty -- that art , music and other beautiful things , far from being simply " in the eye of the beholder , " are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary origins .
art , arts , beauty , brain , culture , design , evolution , society

denis dutton : a darwinian theory of beauty
delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart , which is beauty .
i do the philosophy of art , aesthetics , actually , for a living .
i try to figure out intellectually , philosophically , psychologically , what the experience of beauty is , what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
i mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby 's face , berlioz 's " harold in italy , " movies like " the wizard of oz " or the plays of chekhov , a central california landscape , a hokusai view of mt . fuji , " der rosenkavalier , " a stunning match-winning goal in a world cup soccer match , van gogh 's " starry night , " a jane austen novel , fred astaire dancing across the screen .
this brief list includes human beings , natural landforms , works of art and skilled human actions .
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
i can , however , give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have .
and we get it not from a philosopher of art , not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic .
no , this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,
and you know who i mean : charles darwin .
of course , a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question , " what is beauty ? "
it 's in the eye of the beholder .
it 's whatever moves you personally .
or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder .
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
beethoven is adored in japan .
peruvians love japanese woodblock prints .
inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
or just think about american jazz or american movies -- they go everywhere .
there are many differences among the arts , but there are also universal , cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values .
how can we explain this universality ?
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
we need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds
by the actions of both our prehistoric , largely pleistocene environments , where we became fully human , but also by the social situations in which we evolved .
this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory .
i mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
now , i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty , with its emotional intensity and pleasure , belongs to our evolved human psychology .
the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations .
beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
as many of you will know , evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms .
the first of these is natural selection -- that 's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
natural selection also explains many basic revulsions , such as the horrid smell of rotting meat , or fears , such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff .
natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure , our liking for sweet , fat and proteins , which in turn explains a lot of popular foods , from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs .
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
it did not evolve for natural survival .
in fact , it goes against natural survival .
no , the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens .
it 's quite a familiar story .
it 's women who actually push history forward .
darwin himself , by the way , had no doubts that the peacock 's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen .
he actually used that word .
now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .
beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance , so to speak .
i mean , you can 't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape .
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure , the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .
people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved .
this landscape shows up today on calendars , on postcards , in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from new york to new zealand .
it 's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees .
the trees , by the way , are often preferred if they fork near the ground , that is to say , if they 're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix .
the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it .
this landscape type is regarded as beautiful , even by people in countries that don 't have it .
the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience .
but , someone might argue , that 's natural beauty .
how about artistic beauty ?
isn 't that exhaustively cultural ?
no , i don 't think it is .
and once again , i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet .
chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old , along with a few small , realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period .
but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that . beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you 'd see at an arts and crafts fair , as well as ochre body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
but the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
i have in mind the so-called acheulian hand axes .
the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa .
they go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries , until around 1.4 million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single , thin stone blades , sometimes rounded ovals , but often in what are to our eyes an arresting , symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form .
these acheulian hand axes -- they 're named after st. acheul in france , where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands , scattered across asia , europe and africa , almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed .
now , the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can 't have been made for butchering animals .
and the plot really thickens when you realize that , unlike other pleistocene tools , the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges .
and some , in any event , are too big to use for butchery .
their symmetry , their attractive materials and , above all , their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
so what were these ancient -- i mean , they 're ancient , they 're foreign , but they 're at the same time somehow familiar .
what were these artifacts for ?
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call " fitness signals " -- that is to say , displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail , except that , unlike hair and feathers , the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted .
competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability , conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .
over tens of thousands of generations , such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable .
you know , it 's an old line , but it has been shown to work -- " why don 't you come up to my cave , so i can show you my hand axes ? " except , of course , what 's interesting about this is that we can 't be sure how that idea was conveyed , because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language .
it 's hard to grasp , but it 's an incredible fact .
this object was made by a hominid ancestor , homo erectus or homo ergaster , between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language .
stretching over a million years , the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history .
by the end of the hand axe epic , homo sapiens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by , who knows , telling jokes , storytelling , dancing , or hairstyling .
yes , hairstyling -- i insist on that .
for us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
but still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances .
from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall , human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
we find beauty in something done well .
so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone , don 't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful .
your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it , even before they could put their love into words .
is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
no , it 's deep in our minds .
it 's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors .
our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotion in art , to the beauty of music , to the night sky , will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists .
thank you .

dennis hong : making a car for blind drivers
many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see .
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
so before i talk about this car for the blind , let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
so about that time , the national federation of the blind , or nfb , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently .
we decided to give it a try ,
because we thought , " hey , how hard could it be ? "
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
we just put a blind person in it and we 're done , right ?
we couldn 't have been more wrong .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch .
so to test this crazy idea , we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility .
and in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
so with this success , we decided to take the next big step , to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads .
so how does it work ?
well , it 's a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simplify it .
so we have three steps .
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
now obviously the driver cannot see , so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver .
for that , we use an initial measurement unit .
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration -- like a human ear , inner ear .
we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
and we also use three laser range finders .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
one is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road , there 's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
but the problem is this : how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
so for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology .
so starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system , a vibrating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
but today we 're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
so these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity .
another device is called speedstrip .
so this is a chair -- as a matter of fact , it 's actually a massage chair .
we gut it out , and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns ,
and we actuate them to convey information about the speed , and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment ,
and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening .
this is the sensory data , and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
but the problem is these are instructional cue devices .
so this is not really freedom , right ?
the computer tells you how to drive -- turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
we call this the " backseat-driver problem . "
so we 're moving away from the instructional cue devices , and we 're now focusing more on the informational devices .
a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called airpix .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
so it 's a small tablet , has many holes in it , and compressed air comes out , so it can actually draw images .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
actually , you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature .
so it 's actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
for this , we 're showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the airpix .
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
so basically that 's how it works .
so just a month ago , on january 29th , we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous daytona international speedway during the rolex 24 racing event .
we also had some surprises . let 's take a look .
announcer : this is an historic day in january .
he 's coming up to the grandstand , fellow federationists . there 's the grandstand now .
and he 's [ unclear ] following that van that 's out in front of him .
well there comes the first box .
now let 's see if mark avoids it .
he does . he passes it on the right .
third box is out . the fourth box is out .
and he 's perfectly making his way between the two .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
well this is what it 's all about , this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity .
he 's approaching the end of the run , makes his way between the barrels that are set up there .
dennis hong : i 'm so happy for you .
mark 's going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
mark riccobono : yes .
dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : " now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine . "
but sometimes -- but sometimes i also do get -- i wouldn 't call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern : " dr. hong , are you insane , trying to put blind people on the road ?
you must be out of your mind . "
but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle , and it 's not going to be on the road until it 's proven as safe as , or safer than , today 's vehicle .
and i truly believe that this can happen .
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
how are we going to handle insurance ?
how are we going to issue driver 's licenses ?
there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
of course , the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
the sensors that are used can see through the dark , the fog and rain .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
or for the blind , everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting , in the office setting .
just imagine , in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what 's written and read using these non-visual interfaces .
this is priceless .
so today , the things i 've showed you today , is just the beginning .
thank you very much .

thomas barnett draws a new map for peace
i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long-range strategic planners .
and the answer i like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war .
and what i 've spent 15 years doing in this business -- and it 's taken me almost 14 to figure it out -- is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else .
so i tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace .
the material i 'm going to show you is one idea from a book
with a lot of ideas .
it 's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit .
the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense , thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states .
i 'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer .
here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon : the theory of anti-access , area-denial asymmetrical strategies .
why do we call it that ?
because it 's got all those a 's lined up i guess .
this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we 're going to be huge . they 're going to be small .
and if they try to fight us in the traditional , straight-up manner we 're going to kick their ass , which is why people don 't try to do that any more .
i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat .
he 's now a one star general .
that 's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours .
so that overmatched capability creates problems -- catastrophic successes the white house calls them .
and we 're trying to figure that out , because it is an amazing capability .
the question is , what 's the good you can do with it ?
ok ?
the theory of anti-access , area-denial asymmetrical strategies -- gobbledygook that we sell to congress , because if we just told them we can kick anybody 's asses they wouldn 't buy us all the stuff we want .
so we say , area-denial , anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over .
and they say , " will you build it in my district ? "
here 's my parody and it ain 't much of one .
let 's talk about a battle space . i don 't know , taiwan straits 2025 .
let 's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .
i don 't know , the million man swim .
the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously .
they throw up anti-access , area-denial asymmetrical strategies .
a banana peel on the tarmac .
trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our achilles ' heels instantly .
we say , " china , it 's yours . "
prometheus approach , largely a geographic definition , focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict .
we field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game .
that 's the problem .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare .
here 's the way i like to describe it instead .
there is no battle space the u.s. military cannot access .
they said we couldn 't do afghanistan . we did it with ease .
they said we couldn 't do iraq .
we did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks .
we did it so fast we weren 't prepared for their collapse .
there is nobody we can 't take down .
the question is , what do you do with the power ?
so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces .
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .
problem is , the defense department over here beats the hell out of you .
the state department over here says , " come on boy , i know you can make it . " and that poor country runs off that ledge , does that cartoon thing and then drops .
this is not about overwhelming force , but proportional force .
it 's about non-lethal technologies , because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you 're going to lose friends very quickly .
this is not about projecting power , but about staying power , which is about legitimacy with the locals .
who do you access in this transition space ?
you have to create internal partners . you have to access coalition partners .
we asked the indians for 17,000 peace keepers .
i know their senior leadership , they wanted to give it to us .
but they said to us , " you know what ?
in that transition space you 're mostly hat not enough cattle .
we don 't think you can pull it off , we 're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder . "
we asked the russians for 40,000 .
they said no .
i was in china in august , i said , " you should have 50,000 peace keepers in iraq . it 's your oil , not ours . " which is the truth . it 's their oil .
and the chinese said to me , " dr. barnett , you 're absolutely right .
in a perfect world we 'd have 50,000 there .
but it 's not a perfect world , and your administration isn 't getting us any closer . " but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
we lucked out , frankly , on the selection .
we face different opponents across these three .
and it 's time to start admitting you can 't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all , day in and day out .
it 's just too damn hard .
we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war .
we don 't do the everything else so well .
frankly , we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it .
we have a brilliant secretary of war .
we don 't have a secretary of everything else .
because if we did , that guy would be in front of the senate , still testifying over abu ghraib .
the problem is he doesn 't exist .
there is no secretary of everything else .
i think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war .
i call that the leviathan force .
what we need to build is a force for the everything else . i call them the system administrators .
what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states .
we have one for processing economically bankrupt states .
it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan , ok ?
we argue about it every time we use it .
argentina just went through it , broke a lot of rules .
they got out on the far end , we said , " fine , don 't worry about it . "
it 's transparent . a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome .
we don 't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that , frankly , everybody wants gone .
like saddam , like mugabe , like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .
like the 250,000 dead so far in sudan .
what would an a to z system look like ?
i 'm going to distinguish between what i call front half and back half .
and let 's call this red line , i don 't know , mission accomplished .
what we have extant right now , at the beginning of this system , is the u.n. security council as a grand jury .
what can they do ?
they can indict your ass .
they can debate it . they can write it on a piece of paper . they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you ,
and then say in no uncertain terms , " please cut that out . "
that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the 1990s .
that gets you 250,000 dead in the sudan in the last 15 months .
everybody 's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa ,
and you better have an answer .
we don 't have anything to translate that will into action .
what we do have is the u.s.-enabled leviathan force that says , " you want me to take that guy down ? i 'll take that guy down .
i 'll do it on tuesday . it will cost you 20 billion dollars . " but here 's the deal .
as soon as i can 't find anybody else to air out , i leave the scene immediately .
that 's called the powell doctrine .
way downstream we have the international criminal court .
they love to put them on trial . they 've got milosevic right now .
what are we missing ?
a functioning executive that will translate will into action ,
because we don 't have it . every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
we haven 't faced an imminent threat since the cuban missile crisis in 1962 .
but we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we 're a democracy and that 's what it takes .
and if that doesn 't work we scream , " he 's got a gun ! " just as we rush in .
and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say , " jesus , it was dark . " do you want to do it , france ?
france says , " no , but i do like to criticize you after the fact . " what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force .
we should have had 250,000 troops streaming into iraq on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad .
what do you get then ?
no looting , no military disappearing , no arms disappearing , no ammo disappearing , no muqtada al-sadr -- i 'm wrecking his bones -- no insurgency .
talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months .
we had six months to feel the lob , to get the job done , and we dicked around for six months .
and then they turned on us .
why ? because they just got fed up .
they saw what we did to saddam .
they said , " you 're that powerful , you can resurrect this country .
you 're america . " what we need is an international reconstruction fund --
sebastian mallaby , washington post , great idea .
model on the imf .
instead of passing the hat each time , ok ?
where are we going to find this guy ? g20 , that 's easy .
check out their agenda since 9 / 11 .
all security dominated .
they 're going to decide up front how the money gets spent
just like in the imf .
you vote according to how much money you put in the kitty .
here 's my challenge to the defense department .
you 've got to build this force . you 've got to seed this force . you 've got to track coalition partners . create a record of success .
you will get this model .
you tell me it 's too hard to do .
i 'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the balkans .
we did it just like that .
i 'm talking about regularizing it , making it transparent .
would you like mugabe gone ?
would you like kim jong-il , who 's killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
would you like a better system ?
this is why it matters to the military .
they 've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the cold war .
i 'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire , which i can do because i 'm not inside the beltway .
i 'm talking about the 1990s .
the berlin wall falls . we do desert storm .
the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them ,
like the u.s. submarine community , which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight .
ah !
so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .
the problem is you need a big , sexy opponent to fight against .
and if you can 't find one you 've got to make one up .
china , all grown up , going to be a looker !
the rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s
and they developed this very derisive term to describe it : military operations other than war .
i ask you , who joins the military to do things other than war ?
actually , most of them .
jessica lynch never planned on shooting back .
most of them don 't pick up a rifle .
i maintain this is code inside the army for , " we don 't want to do this . "
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world
what i call the core and the gap .
the clinton administration wasn 't interested in running this .
for eight years , after screwing up the relationship on day one -- inauguration day with gays in the military -- which was deft .
so we were home alone for eight years .
and what did we do home alone ?
we bought one military and we operated another .
it 's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says , " doctor , it hurts when i do this . " the doctor says , " stop doing that you idiot . " i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s .
i 'd say , " you 're buying one military and you 're operating another ,
and eventually it 's going to hurt . it 's wrong .
bad pentagon , bad ! " and they 'd say , " dr. barnett , you are so right .
can you come back next year and remind us again ? " some people say 9 / 11 heals the rift -- jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history , drags them down in to the muck and says , " you want a networked opponent ?
i 've got one , he 's everywhere , go find him . "
it elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy , because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap .
some people put these two things together and they call it empire , which i think is a boneheaded concept .
empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets , which you cannot do , but maximum rule sets which you must do .
it 's not our system of governance .
never how we 've sought to interact with the outside world .
i prefer that phrase system administration .
we enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy .
certain bad things you cannot do .
how this impacts the way we think about the future of war .
this is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the pentagon .
it makes me very popular as well .
everybody 's got an opinion .
going back to the beginning of our country -- historically , defenses meant protection of the homeland .
security has meant everything else .
written into our constitution , two different forces , two different functions .
raise an army when you need it , and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity .
a department of war , a department of everything else .
a big stick , a baton stick .
can of whup ass , the networking force .
in 1947 we merged these two things together in the defense department .
our long-term rationale becomes , we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .
to attack america is to risk blowing up the world .
we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay .
that 's not our problem now .
they can kill three million in chicago tomorrow and we don 't go to the mattresses with nukes .
that 's the scary part .
the question is how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable , and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet ?
what 's happened since is that bifurcation i described .
we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war .
let 's have a department of war , and a department of something else .
some people say , " hell , 9 / 11 did it for you . "
now we 've got a home game and an away game .
the department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure .
it 's going to be the department of agriculture for the 21st century .
tsa -- thousands standing around .
just be grateful robert reed didn 't shove that bomb up his ass .
because we 'd all be gay then .
i supported the war in iraq .
he was a bad guy with multiple priors .
it 's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him .
i knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the leviathan force .
i knew we 'd have a hard time with what followed .
but i know this organization doesn 't change until it experiences failure .
what do i mean by these two different forces ?
this is the hobbesian force .
i love this force . i don 't want to see it go . that plus nukes rules out great power war .
this is the military the rest of the world wants us to build .
it 's why i travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries .
what does this mean ?
it means you 've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old .
switching back , morning , afternoon , evening , morning , afternoon , evening .
handing out aid , shooting back , handing out aid , shooting back .
it 's too much .
the 19-year-olds get tired from the switching , ok ?
that force on the left , you can train a 19-year-old to do that .
that force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop .
you need the experience .
what does this mean in terms of operations ?
the rule is going to be this .
that sys admin force is the force that never comes home , does most of your work .
you break out that leviathan force only every so often .
but here 's the promise you make to the american public , to your own people , to the world .
you break out that leviathan force , you promise , you guarantee that you 're going to mount one hell of a -- immediately -- follow-on sys admin effort .
don 't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace .
other differences . leviathan traditional partners , they all look like the brits and their former colonies .
including us , i would remind you .
the rest -- wider array of partners .
international organizations , non-governmental organizations , private voluntary organizations , contractors .
you 're not going to get away from that .
leviathan force , it 's all about joint operations between the military services .
we 're done with that .
what we need to do is inter-agency operations , which frankly condi rice was in charge of .
and i 'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed .
i call the leviathan force your dad 's military .
i like them young , male , unmarried , slightly pissed off .
i call the sys admin force your mom 's military .
it 's everything the man 's military hates .
gender balanced much more , older , educated , married with children .
the force on the left , up or out .
the force on the right , in and out .
the force on the left respects posse comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the u.s .
the force on the right 's going to obliterate it .
that 's where the national guard 's going to be .
the force on the left is never coming under the purview of the international criminal court .
sys admin force has to .
different definitions of network centricity .
one takes down networks , one puts them up .
and you 've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that .
do we need a bigger budget ?
do we need a draft to pull this off ?
absolutely not .
i 've been told by the revolution of military affairs crowd for years , we can do it faster , cheaper , smaller , just as lethal .
i say , " great , i 'm going to take the sys admin budget out of your hide . " here 's the larger point .
you 're going to build the sys admin force inside the u.s. military first .
but ultimately you 're going to civilianize it , probably two thirds .
inter agency-ize it , internationalize it .
so yes , it begins inside the pentagon , but over time it 's going to cross that river .
i have been to the mountain top . i can see the future .
i may not live long enough to get you there , but it 's going to happen .
we 're going to have a department of something else between war and peace .
last slide .
who gets custody of the kids ?
this is where the marines in the audience get kind of tense .
and this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk .
read max boon .
this is the history of the marines -- small wars , small arms .
the marines are like my west highland terrier .
they get up every morning , they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something .
i don 't want my marines handing out aid . i want them to be marines .
that 's what keeps the sys admin force from being a pussy force .
it keeps it from being the u.n .
you shoot at these people the marines are going to come over and kill you .
department of navy , strategic subs go this way , surface combatants are over there , and the news is they may actually be that small .
i call it the smart dust navy .
i tell young officers , " you may command 500 ships in your career . bad news is they may not have anybody on them . "
carriers go both ways because they 're a swing asset .
you 'll see the pattern -- airborne , just like carriers .
armor goes this way .
here 's the dirty secret of the air force , you can win by bombing .
but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .
shinseki was right with the argument .
air force , strategic airlift goes both ways .
bombers , fighters go over here .
special operations command down at tampa .
trigger-pullers go this way .
civil affairs , that bastard child , comes over here .
return to the army .
the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command .
no off season , these guys are always active .
they drop in , do their business , disappear .
see me now . don 't talk about it later .
i was never here .
the world is my playground .
i want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy .
i want the rules to be as loose as possible .
because when the thing gets prevented in chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition , these are the guys who are going to kill them first .
so it 's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that .
reserve component -- national guard reserves overwhelmingly sys admin .
how are you going to get them to work for this force ?
most firemen in this country do it for free .
this is not about money .
this is about being up front with these guys and gals .
last point , intelligence community -- the muscle and the defense agencies go this way .
what should be the cia , open , analytical , open source should come over here .
the information you need to do this is not secret .
it 's not secret .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
they said , " al qaeda could be listening . " they said , " well , jesus , they already know this stuff . " take a gift in the left hand .
these are the sunglasses that don 't scare people , simple stuff .
censors and transparency , the overheads go in both directions .
thanks .

freeman dyson says : let 's look for life in the outer solar system
how will we be remembered in 200 years ?
i happen to live in a little town , princeton , in new jersey , which every year celebrates the great event in princeton history : the battle of princeton , which was , in fact , a very important battle .
it was the first battle that george washington won , in fact , and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence .
it happened 225 years ago .
it was actually a terrible disaster for princeton .
the town was burned down ; it was in the middle of winter , and it was a very , very severe winter .
and about a quarter of all the people in princeton died that winter from hunger and cold , but nobody remembers that .
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and so i agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered . it 's the child that 's remembered .
and that 's what we 're going through at this time .
i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,
because i think i know very little about that -- i 'm not a biologist -- so everything i know about it can be said in one minute .
what i 'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry , that what really turned computers into a great success , in the world as a whole , is toys . as soon as computers became toys , when kids could come home and play with them , then the industry really took off . and that has to happen with biotech .
there 's a huge -- -- there 's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists , who are dog breeders , pigeon breeders , orchid breeders , rose breeders , people who handle biology with their hands , and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things , beautiful creatures , plants , animals , pets . these people will be empowered with biotech , and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
when people have this technology in their hands , you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit , grow your own --
grow your dog , grow your own cat .
just buy the software , you design it . i won 't say anymore , you can take it on from there . it 's going to happen , and i think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural , becomes part of the human condition , something that everybody 's familiar with and everybody accepts .
so , let 's leave that aside .
i want to talk about something quite different , which is what i know about , and that is astronomy .
and i 'm interested in searching for life in the universe .
and it 's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that , and that 's what i 'll talk about for 10 minutes , or whatever the time remains .
the important fact is , that most of the real estate that 's accessible to us -- i 'm not talking about the stars , i 'm talking about the solar system , the stuff that 's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --
most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the sun .
if you look at the solar system , as we know it today , it has a few planets close to the sun . that 's where we live .
it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the earth out through -- to the orbit of jupiter .
the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate , but not very large . and it 's not very promising for life , since most of it consists of rock and metal , mostly rock .
it 's not only cold , but very dry .
so the asteroids we don 't have much hope for .
there stand some interesting places a little further out : the moons of jupiter and saturn .
particularly , there 's a place called europa , which is -- europa is one of the moons of jupiter , where we see a very level ice surface , which looks as if it 's floating on top of an ocean .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
and that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore .
ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate , just as it originated on the earth . so we would love to explore europa , to go down through the ice , find out who is swimming around in the ocean , whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that 's exciting --- or cephalopods .
but that 's hard to do . unfortunately , the ice is thick .
we don 't know just how thick it is , probably miles thick , so it 's very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore .
that 's something we don 't yet know how to do .
there are plans to do it , but it 's hard .
go out a bit further , you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune , way out , far from the sun , that 's where the real estate really begins .
you 'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which , in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud -- these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the sun . mostly , they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system , but they are biologically very interesting indeed , because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals , which are just the right ones for developing life .
so if life could be established out there , it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight -- everything that 's needed .
so , what i 'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life , rather than on mars , although mars is , of course , also a very promising and interesting place .
but we can look outside , very cheaply and in a simple fashion .
and that 's what i 'm going to talk about .
there is a -- imagine that life originated on europa , and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years .
it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface , just as it did on the earth .
staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years , finally came out onto the land . and then of course it had great -- much greater freedom , and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean .
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy , but it happened .
now , if life had originated on europa in the ocean , it could also have moved out onto the surface .
there wouldn 't have been any air there -- it 's a vacuum .
it is out in the cold , but it still could have come .
you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice , growing on the surface .
what would they need in order to grow on the surface ?
they 'd need , first of all , to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin .
so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight .
the sunlight in jupiter , on the satellites of jupiter , is 25 times fainter than it is here , since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .
so they would have to have -- these creatures , which i call sunflowers , which i imagine living on the surface of europa , would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight , so they could keep themselves warm on the surface .
otherwise , they would be at a temperature of minus 150 , which is certainly not favorable for developing life , at least of the kind we know .
but if they just simply could grow , like leaves , little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight , then they could keep warm on the surface . they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean ; life then could flourish much more .
so , why not look ? of course , it 's not very likely that there 's life on the surface of europa .
none of these things is likely , but my , my philosophy is , look for what 's detectable , not for what 's probable .
there 's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .
this was -- originally , when radio astronomy began , mr. jansky , at the bell labs , detected radio waves coming from the sky . and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
they said , " it 's all right , you can detect radio waves from the sun , but the sun is the only object in the universe that 's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable . you can easily calculate that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint , and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away , so it certainly will not be detectable .
so there 's no point in looking . "
and that , of course , that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about 20 years .
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
well , of course , as soon as anybody did look , which was after about 20 years , when radio astronomy really took off . because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum , much brighter than the sun .
so , the same thing could be true for this kind of life , which i 'm talking about , on cold objects : that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe , and it 's not been detected just because we haven 't taken the trouble to look .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it .
there is something called pit lamping . that 's the phrase which i learned from my son george , who is there in the audience .
you take -- that 's a canadian expression . if you happen to want to hunt animals at night , you take a miner 's lamp , which is a pit lamp .
you strap it onto your forehead , so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal . so , if you go out at night , you shine a flashlight , the animals are bright .
you see the red glow in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flashlight .
and then , if you 're one of these unsporting characters , you shoot the animals and take them home .
and of course , that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime ,
so in canada that 's illegal . in new zealand , it 's legal , because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits , because the rabbits compete with the sheep in new zealand .
so , the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps , and shine the headlights , and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep , you shoot .
so i have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe .
that if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces -- either on europa , or further out , anywhere where you can live on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors .
in order to concentrate sunlight , they have to have lenses and mirrors -- in order to keep themselves warm .
and then , when you shine sunlight at them , the sunlight will be reflected back , just as it is in the eyes of an animal .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
and the further out you go in this , away from the sun , the more powerful this reflection will be . so actually , this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away , because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background .
so as you go further away from the sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
so , in fact , you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the earth .
why aren 't we doing it ? simply because nobody thought of it yet .
but i hope that we shall look , and with any -- we probably won 't find anything ,
none of these speculations may have any basis in fact . but still , it 's a good chance . and of course , if it happens , it will transform our view of life altogether .
because it means that -- the way life can live out there ,
it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet .
it 's extremely hard to move from one planet to another .
we 're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
especially if you breathe air , it 's very hard to get from planet a to planet b , because there 's no air in between . but if you breathe air -- -- you 're dead -- -- as soon as you 're off the planet , unless you have a spaceship .
but if you live in a vacuum , if you live on the surface of one of these objects , say , in the kuiper belt , this -- an object like pluto , or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of pluto , and you happened -- if you 're living on the surface there , and you get knocked off the surface by a collision , then it doesn 't change anything all that much . you still are on a piece of ice , you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you 're traveling from one place to another .
and then if you run into another object , you can stay there and colonize the other object . so life will spread , then , from one object to another . so if it exists at all in the kuiper belt , it 's likely to be very widespread . and you will have then a great competition amongst species -- darwinian evolution -- so there 'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another without having to wait for a collision . and there 'll be advantages for spreading out long , sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation .
i call these creatures sunflowers .
they look like , maybe like sunflowers .
they have to be all the time pointing toward the sun , and they will be able to spread out in space , because gravity on these objects is weak .
so they can collect sunlight from a big area .
so they will , in fact , be quite easy for us to detect .
so , i hope in the next 10 years , we 'll find these creatures , and then , of course , our whole view of life in the universe will change .
if we don 't find them , then we can create them ourselves .
that 's another wonderful opportunity that 's opening .
we can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering , one of the things you can do with your take-it-home , do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite , a place like europa , so we could colonize europa with our own creatures .
that would be a fun thing to do .
in the long run , of course , it would also make it possible for us to move out there .
what 's going to happen in the end , it 's not going to be just humans colonizing space , it 's going to be life moving out from the earth ,
moving it into its kingdom . and the kingdom of life , of course , is going to be the universe . and if life is already there , it makes it much more exciting , in the short run . but in the long run , if there 's no life there , we create it ourselves .
we transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today .
so again , we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .
thank you .

designer yves behar digs up his creative roots to discuss some of the iconic objects he 's created . then he turns to the witty , surprising , elegant objects he 's working on now -- including the " $ 100 laptop . "

yves behar on designing objects that tell stories
being a child , and sort of crawling around the house , i remember these turkish carpets ,
and there were these scenes , these battle scenes , these love scenes .
i mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier .
and my mom took these pictures actually , last week , of our carpets , and i remember this to this day .
there was another object , this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff , when you 're a little kid .
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories , so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work .
and then there was another influence .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
and so , i fused together the two things i loved the most , which was skiing and windsurfing .
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland .
so , i created this compilation of the two : i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there , and some foot straps , and some metal fins , and here i was , going really fast on frozen lakes .
it was really a death trap . i mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
and i realized then i had to go to design school .
i mean , look at those graphics there .
so , i went to design school , and it was the early ' 90s when i finished . and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes ,
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , " well , what we 're going to do here is really important , you know . "
and they would give the projects code names , you know , mostly from " star wars , " actually : things like c3po , yoda , luke .
so , in anticipation , i would be this young designer in the back of the room , and i would raise my hand , and i would ask questions .
i mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like , " what 's this caps lock key for ? "
or " what 's this num lock key for ? " you know , that thing ?
" you know , do people really use it ?
do they need it ? do they want it in their homes ? "
what i realized then is , they didn 't really want to change the legacy stuff ; they didn 't want to change the insides .
they were really looking for us , the designers , to create the skins , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box .
and i didn 't want to be a colorist .
it wasn 't what i wanted to do .
i didn 't want to be a stylist in this way .
and then i saw this quote : " advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal . "
so , i had to start on my own . so i moved to san francisco , and i started a little company , fuseproject .
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff .
and i wanted to really not just work on the skins , but i wanted to work on the entire human experience .
and so the first projects were sort of humble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new functionality .
this is a watch we made for mini cooper , the car company , right when it launched , and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical .
and that allows me to check my timer discretely , here , without bending my elbow .
and other projects , which were really about transformation , about matching the human need .
this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer , and it ships completely flat , and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot .
and something a little bit more experimental : this is a light fixture for swarovski , and what it does is , it changes shape .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight . and just by drawing on a little computer tablet , the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for herman miller .
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light , a new experience of light .
so , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
and that 's a unique opportunity , i would say , in design .
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm , sort of glowing kind of mood light , all the way to a bright work light .
so , the light bulb actually does that .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
and it 's done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
so , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it 's for business , or , as i 'm going to show , on some civic-type projects .
because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business , value to the users also , but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value .
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustainability , about lower power consumption .
you know , they can be about function and beauty ; they can be about business strategy .
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
so jawbone is a project that you 're familiar with , and it has a humanistic technology .
it feels your skin . it rests on your skin , and it knows when it is you 're talking .
and by knowing when it is you 're talking , it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about , which is the environmental noises .
but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff , and all the nerdy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn 't beautiful , it really doesn 't belong on your face .
and this is what we 're pursuing here .
but how we work on jawbone is really unique .
i want to point at something here , on the left .
this is the board , this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work .
but this is the design process : there 's somebody changing the board , putting tracers on the board , changing the location of the ics , as the designers on the other side are doing the work .
so , it 's not about slapping skins , anymore , on a technology .
it 's really about designing from the inside out .
and then , on the other side of the room , the designers are making small adjustments , sketching , drawing by hand , putting it in the computer . and it 's what i call being design driven .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
and then , of course , design is never done .
and this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is , because it 's never done , you have to do all this other stuff .
the packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
but how do you retain somebody , when it 's never done ?
and hosain rahman , the ceo of aliph jawbone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
so , in a way , the different structure is that we 're partners , it 's a partnership . we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project , and then we also share in the rewards .
and here 's another project , another partnership-type approach .
this is called y water , and it 's this guy from los angeles , thomas arndt , austrian originally , who came to us , and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink , or an organic drink for his kids , to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he 's trying to get them away from .
so , we worked on this bottle , and it 's completely symmetrical in every dimension .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
thank you .
and then while we were doing this , the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y , and then we thought , well these words , " why " and " why not , " are probably the most important words that kids ask .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the branding , it all becomes deeply connected .
and then the other thing about this project is , we bring intellectual property , we bring a marketing approach , we bring all this stuff , but i think , at the end of the day , what we bring is these values , and these values create a soul for the companies we work with .
and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor , when others can be creative and do more with it .
here 's another project , which i think really emulates that .
this is the one laptop per child , the $ 100 laptop .
this picture is incredible .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
i mean , to me , it just means so much .
but when nicholas negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot , he 's the founder of olpc -- came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology , and those are pillars of his life , but also pillars of the mission of one laptop per child .
but the third pillar that he talked about was design .
and at the time , i wasn 't really working on computers .
i didn 't really want to , from the previous adventure .
but what he said was really significant , is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product ,
how we were going to make it low cost , robust . and plus , he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key -- -- and the num lock key , too .
so , i was convinced . we designed it to be iconic , to look different . to look like it 's for a kid , but not like a toy .
and then the integration of all these great technologies , which you 've heard about , the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ; the screen , which you can read in sunlight ; the keyboard , which is made out of rubber , and it 's protected from the environment .
you know , all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers .
they fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
i mean , they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is .
and in a way , it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea .
and i think this is something really important .
so , now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning , and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers , and in mongolia .
and we went away from obviously the beige . i mean it 's colorful , it 's fun .
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
it 's because we were able to run , during the manufacturing process , 20 colors for the x and the o , which is the name of the computer , and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor , you get 20 times 20 : you get 400 different options there .
so , the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible .
but this is my nephew , anthony , in switzerland , and he had the laptop for an afternoon , and i had to take it back . it was hard .
and it was a prototype . and a month and a half later , i come back to switzerland , and there he is playing with his own version .
like paper , paper and cardboard .
so , i 'm going to finish with one last project , and this is a little bit more of adult play .
some of you might have heard about the new york city condom .
it 's actually just launched , actually launched on valentine 's day , february 14 , about 10 days ago .
so , the department of health in new york came to us , and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of new york .
so a pretty big endeavor , and we worked on the dispensers . these are the dispensers . there 's this friendly shape .
it 's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant , and it has to be easily serviceable : you have to know where it is and what it does .
and we also designed the condoms themselves .
and i was just in new york at the launch , and i went to see all these places where they 're installed :
this is at a puerto rican little mom-and-pop store ; at a bar in christopher street ; at a pool hall .
i mean , they 're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere .
of course , clubs and discos , too .
and here 's the public service announcement for this project .
get some .
so , this is really where design is able to create a conversation .
i was in these venues , and people were , you know , really into getting them . they were excited .
it was breaking the ice , it was getting over a stigma , and i think that 's also what design can do .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i 'm not sure it 's the etiquette here .
yeah ? all right , all right . i have only a few .
so , i have more , you can always ask me for some more later .
and if anybody asks why you 're carrying a condom , you can just say you like the design .
so , i 'll finish with just one thought : if we all work together on creating value , but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do , i think we can change the work that we do .
we can change these values , can change the companies we work with , and eventually , together , maybe we can change the world .
so , thank you .

eric whitacre : virtual choir live
in 1991 i had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life .
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
i took a couple victory laps in there .
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains .
and there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise , and as we sat there , over the mountains coming in
from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds rolling toward us , and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley , so help me god , every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time .
this electric hush , as if they could sense what was about to happen .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
it was just extraordinary , and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz , and decided to set it to music , a piece for choir called " cloudburst , " which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment .
now fast forward to just three years ago .
and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
two years ago , on this very stage , we premiered virtual choir 2 , 2,052 singers from 58 different countries , this time performing a piece that i had written called " sleep . "
and then just last spring we released virtual choir 3 , " water night , " another piece that i had written , this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries .
and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this , he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could .
could we do this all in real time ?
could we have people singing together in real time ?
and with the help of skype , that is what we are going to attempt today .
now , we 'll perform " cloudburst " for you .
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach , cal state fullerton and riverside community college , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and - -- and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
now , we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go , but there 's still less than a second of latency , but in musical terms , that 's a lifetime .
we deal in milliseconds .
so what i 've done is , i 've adapted " cloudburst " so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together .
so with deep humility , and for your approval , we present " cloudburst . "
[ the rain ... ] [ eyes of shadow-water ] [ eyes of well-water ] [ eyes of dream-water . ] [ blue suns , green whirlwinds , ] [ birdbeaks of light pecking open ] [ pomegranate stars . ] [ but tell me , burnt earth , is there no water ? ] [ only blood , only dust , ] [ only naked footsteps on the thorns ? ] [ the rain awakens ... ] [ we must sleep with open eyes , ] [ we must dream with our hands , ] [ we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course , ] [ of the sun dreaming its worlds . ] [ we must dream aloud , ] [ we must sing till the song puts forth roots , ] [ trunk , branches , birds , stars . ] [ we must find the lost word , ] [ and remember what the blood , ] [ the tides , the earth , and the body say , ] [ and return to the point of departure ... ] [ " cloudburst " octavio paz ] [ translation by lysander kemp , adapted by eric whitacre ] eric whitacre : beth . annabelle , where are you ? jacob .
thank you .

investing in women can unlock infinite potential around the globe . but how can women walk the line between western-style empowerment and traditional culture ? kavita ramdas of the global fund for women talks about three encounters with powerful women who fight to make the world better -- while preserving the traditions that sustain them .

kavita ramdas : radical women , embracing tradition
salaam . namaskar .
good morning .
given my ted profile , you might be expecting that i 'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that 's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing -- how to invest in women , how to empower them , how to save them .
not me .
i am interested in how women are saving us .
they 're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities , polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time , like the ones between modernity and tradition , first world and third world , oppression and opportunity .
in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community , there 's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing . what intrigues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating .
why is it that women are , on the one hand , viciously oppressed by cultural practices , and yet at the same time , are the preservers of cultures in most societies ?
is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance ?
when so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor , religion , nationality -- what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
or are they one and the same ?
are we guilty , as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford , of assuming that there is a single story of women 's struggles for their rights while there are , in fact , many ?
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
it 's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people .
in the process , i 've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle .
among those who 've helped open my eyes to a third way are : a devout muslim in afghanistan , a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a taboo breaker in liberia .
i 'm indebted to them , as i am to my parents , who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life , were blessed with three daughters in this one .
and for reasons equally unclear to me , seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us .
i was born and raised here in india , and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down , pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all , " poor things . you only have three daughters .
but you 're young , you could still try again . "
my sense of outrage about women 's rights was brought to a boil when i was about 11 .
my aunt , an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman , was widowed early .
a flock of relatives descended on her .
they took off her colorful sari .
they made her wear a white one .
they wiped her bindi off her forehead .
they broke her bangles .
her daughter , rani , a few years older than me , sat in her lap bewildered , not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother .
late that night , i heard my mother begging my father , " please do something ramu . can 't you intervene ? "
and my father , in a low voice , muttering , " i 'm just the youngest brother , there 's nothing i can do .
this is tradition . "
that 's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world .
women don 't make those rules , but they define us , and they define our opportunities and our chances .
and men are affected by those rules too .
my father , who had fought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
by 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist .
on the streets chanting , " [ hindi ] [ hindi ] we are the women of india .
we are not flowers , we are sparks of change . "
by the time i got to beijing in 1995 , it was clear to me , the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition .
soon after i returned from beijing , i leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization , founded by women , to support women 's rights organizations around the globe .
but barely six months into my new job , i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions .
her name is sakena yacoobi .
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states .
she said to me , " it is not about the burka . "
she was the most determined advocate for women 's rights i had ever heard .
she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan , and that her organization , the afghan institute of learning , had started a school in pakistan .
she said , " the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy .
the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves . "
had i heard right ?
was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion ?
but sakena defies labels .
she always wears a headscarf ,
but i 've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze .
she starts every lecture with a prayer , but she 's a single , feisty , financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12 .
she is also immensely pragmatic .
" this headscarf and these clothes , " she says , " give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work .
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp , i went to see the imam .
i told him , ' i 'm a believer , and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive . ' "
she smiles slyly .
" he was flattered .
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran , then a math class , then an english class , then computer classes .
in a few weeks , everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes . "
sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan .
she is on the taliban 's hit list .
i worry about her every time she travels across that country .
she shrugs when i ask her about safety .
" kavita jaan , we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid .
look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face . "
and i smile , and i nod , realizing i 'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices , turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity .
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different .
being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb , croatia know all too well .
to be a lesbian , a dyke , a homosexual in most parts of the world , including right here in our country , india , is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice .
in post-conflict societies like croatia , where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast .
so enter a group of out dykes , young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia , from serbia to slovenia .
these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program .
many are in their 20s , some are mothers .
many have struggled to come out to their communities ,
in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick , just queer .
as leah , one of the founders of the group , says , " i like traditional music very much .
i also like rock and roll .
so lesbor , we blend the two .
i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic .
after the war , lots of these songs were lost ,
but they are a part of our childhood and our history , and we should not forget them . " improbably , this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change , like alchemists turning discord into harmony .
their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem , a bosnian love song and serbian duets .
and , leah adds with a grin , " kavita , we especially are proud of our christmas music , because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us lgbt . "
their concerts draw from their own communities , yes , but also from an older generation : a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality , but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents .
one father , who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir , now writes songs for them .
in the middle ages , troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses :
lesbor travels through the balkans like this , singing , connecting people divided by religion , nationality and language . bosnians , croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history , and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all .
yesterday , mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given .
the world layma bowie was given was a world at war .
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades .
layma was not an activist , she was a mother of three .
but she was sick with worry :
she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier ,
she worried her daughters would be raped ,
she worried for their lives .
one night , she had a dream .
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .
the next morning at church , she asked others how they felt .
they were all tired of the fighting .
we need peace , and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace .
among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim .
she promised to raise the issue with her community .
at the next friday sermon , the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs .
" what does it matter ? " they said , " a bullet doesn 't distinguish between a muslim and a christian . "
this small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war ,
and they chose to use their traditions to make a point :
liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
as layma said , " we wore the white saying we were out for peace . "
they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day .
they stood for weeks -- first just 10 , then 20 , then 50 , then hundreds of women -- wearing white , singing , dancing , saying they were out for peace .
eventually , opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana .
the peace talks dragged on and on and on .
layma and her sisters had had enough .
with their remaining funds , they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building .
in a now famous cnn clip , you can see them sitting on the ground , their arms linked .
we know this in india . it 's called a [ hindi ] .
then things get tense .
the police are called in to physically remove the women .
as the senior officer approaches with a baton , layma stands up with deliberation , reaches her arms up over her head , and begins , very slowly , to untie her headdress that covers her hair .
you can see the policeman 's face .
he looks embarrassed . he backs away .
and the next thing you know , the police have disappeared .
layma said to me later , " it 's a taboo , you know , in west africa .
if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to , the man 's family is cursed . "
she said , " i don 't know if he did it because he believed , but he knew we were not going to leave .
we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed . "
and the peace accord was signed .
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf , a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years .
when she made her presidential address , she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star -- that 's soccer for you americans -- no less .
women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
they 've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
a filipina activist once said to me , " how do you cook a rice cake ?
with heat from the bottom and heat from the top . "
the protests , the marches , the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights , full stop .
that 's the heat from the bottom .
that 's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades .
but we also need the heat from the top .
and in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men .
so to paraphrase marx : women make change , but not in circumstances of their own choosing .
they have to negotiate .
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations .
and they need allies from their communities . allies like the imam , allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia , allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away , allies like my father , who couldn 't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams .
maybe this is because feminism , unlike almost every other social movement , is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --
it 's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers -- it 's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women , far too often , hold ourselves .
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism , that the personal is in fact the political .
so that , as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights , the same is true of gender equality : that it starts in small places , close to home .
on the streets , yes , but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends . and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles , women like sakena and leah and layma -- but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran -- are doing something else .
they 're challenging the very notion of western models of development .
they are saying , we don 't have to be like you to make change .
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou , and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers .
we can use our tradition to navigate change .
we can demilitarize societies and pour resources , instead , into reservoirs of genuine security .
it is in these little stories , these individual stories , that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world .
it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities , that i find hope .
and if my heart is singing , it 's because in these little fragments , every now and again , you catch a glimpse of a whole , of a whole new world .
and she is definitely on her way .
thank you .

hannah brencher 's mother always wrote her letters . so when she felt herself bottom into depression after college , she did what felt natural -- she wrote love letters and left them for strangers to find . the act has become a global initiative , the world needs more love letters , which rushes handwritten letters to those in need of a boost .

hannah brencher : love letters to strangers
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , i did the only thing i could think of at the time . i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me
for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . i left them everywhere ,
in cafes and in libraries , at the u.n. , everywhere .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural kansas , all asking me , a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox .
well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they 're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
but , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper .
they could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters .
they 're the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
we have learned to diary our pain onto facebook , and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less .
but what if it 's not about efficiency this time ?
i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you . if you ever need one , just carry one of these . and a man just stared at me , and he was like , " well , why don 't you use the internet ? "
and i thought , " well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a storyteller . "
and so i could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from afghanistan , and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation , and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say , " come back to me .
find me when you can . "
or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in dubuque , iowa , only to find her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees , tucked in the bushes and the benches .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
these are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now ,
all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins . the mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iphone is pinging and we 've got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the goliath of " get faster , " no matter how many social networks we might join .
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
thank you .

organic chemists make molecules , very complicated molecules , by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering .
and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
