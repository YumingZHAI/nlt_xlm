but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . "
" and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
" i do indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .
" i told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
yet he knew to the contrary himself . he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
" but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? "
" oh , yes ! --that , that is the worst of all .
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . and when i returned home , the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight 's time .
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ?
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . that _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
that such a consequence as _ this _ could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts . "
" when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? "
" not the slightest . i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away .
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " * * * * *
it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . from elizabeth 's thoughts it was never absent . fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self-reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
they travelled as expeditiously as possible , and , sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day .
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ; and , when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her .
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .
" not yet , " replied jane . " but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well . "
" is my father in town ? "
" yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word . "
" and have you heard from him often ? "
" we have heard only twice .
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention . "
" and my mother--how is she ?
how are you all ? "
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .
mary and kitty , thank heaven , are quite well . "
" but you--how are you ? " cried elizabeth .
" you look pale .
how much you must have gone through ! "
her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party .
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ' conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing .
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point in going to brighton , with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after .
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was overruled , as i always am .
poor dear child !
and now here 's mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . "
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he ; " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .
in a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
" oh ! my dear brother , " replied mrs. bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for .
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry .
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married .
and , above all , keep mr. bennet from fighting .
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frighted out of my wits--and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me--such spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
oh , brother , how kind you are !
i know you will contrive it all . "
but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fear ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table , they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty .
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table :
" this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . " then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard .
give me further particulars .
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ?
they must have seen them together for ever . "
" colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . i am so grieved for him !
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .
he _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
" and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ?
had colonel forster seen denny himself ? "
" yes ; but , when questioned by _ him _ , denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it .
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _ that _ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "
" and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? "
" how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ?
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . my father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
" but not before they went to brighton ? "
" no , i believe not . "
" and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself ?
does he know his real character ? "
" i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "
" oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
" perhaps it would have been better , " replied her sister . " but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . we acted with the best intentions . "
" could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia 's note to his wife ? "
" he brought it with him for us to see . "
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .
these were the contents :
" my dear harriet ,
" you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them and sign my name ' lydia wickham . '
what a good joke it will be !
i can hardly write for laughing .
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . good-bye .
give my love to colonel forster . i hope you will drink to our good journey .
" your affectionate friend ,
" lydia bennet . "
" oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it .
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment !
but at least it shows that _ she _ was serious on the subject of their journey . whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy .
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! "
" i never saw anyone so shocked .
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
" oh !
jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
" i do not know .
i hope there was . but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult .
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . "
" your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
you do not look well .
oh that i had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
" mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure ; but i did not think it right for either of them . kitty is slight and delicate ; and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .
she was of great use and comfort to us all . and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . "
" she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one 's neighbours .
assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable .
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .
" he meant i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them .
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham . if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
chapter 48
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .
his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion .
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain .
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband 's not being killed in a duel .
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom .
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up--though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham 's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman 's family .
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister 's ruin more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday his wife received a letter from him ; it told them that , on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street ; that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon .
there was also a postscript to this effect : " i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself .
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .
at present we have nothing to guide us .
colonel forster will , i dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . but , on second thoughts , perhaps , lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved .
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .
the arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning 's impatience .
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . it was as follows :
" my dear sir ,
" i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind .
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ?
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .
let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
" i am , dear sir , etc . , etc . "
mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .
his former acquaintances had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .
there was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount .
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton .
he owed a good deal in town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family .
jane heard them with horror .
" a gamester ! " she cried .
" this is wholly unexpected .
i had not an idea of it . "
mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law 's entreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ? " she cried .
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them .
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and the children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world .
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley .
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that _ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia 's infamy somewhat better . it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
it was not till the afternoon , when he had joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that .
who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . "
" you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth .
" you may well warn me against such an evil .
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . it will pass away soon enough . "
" do you suppose them to be in london ? "
" yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
" and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty .
" she is happy then , " said her father drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
then after a short silence he continued :
" lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . "
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother 's tea .
" this is a parade , " he cried , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ; or , perhaps , i may defer it till kitty runs away . "
" i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty fretfully .
" if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . "
" _ you _ go to brighton . i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds !
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .
no officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village .
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . "
chapter 49
two days after mr. bennet 's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . "
" what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town . "
" dear madam , " cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , " don 't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?
he has been here this half-hour , and master has had a letter . "
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said :
" if you are looking for my master , ma 'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
jane , who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out :
" oh , papa , what news--what news ?
have you heard from my uncle ? "
" yes i have had a letter from him by express . "
" well , and what news does it bring--good or bad ? "
" what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket .
" but perhaps you would like to read it . "
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
jane now came up .
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about . "
" gracechurch street , monday , august 2 .
" my dear brother ,
" at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope it will give you satisfaction .
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were . the particulars i reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered .
" then it is as i always hoped , " cried jane ; " they are married ! " elizabeth read on :
" i have seen them both .
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .
these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .
send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .
she comes to us to-day .
i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . yours , etc . ,
" edw . gardiner . "
" is it possible ? " cried elizabeth , when she had finished .
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , " said her sister .
" my dear father , i congratulate you . "
" and have you answered the letter ? " cried elizabeth .
" no ; but it must be done soon . "
" oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back and write immediately . consider how important every moment is in such a case . "
" let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
" i dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .
" and may i ask-- " said elizabeth ; " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . "
" complied with !
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
" and they _ must _ marry !
yet he is _ such _ a man ! "
" yes , yes , they must marry .
there is nothing else to be done .
but there are two things that i want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am i ever to pay him . "
" money !
my uncle ! " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "
" i mean , that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . "
" that is very true , " said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !
oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings !
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .
a small sum could not do all this . "
" no , " said her father ; " wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
" ten thousand pounds !
heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .
their father then went on to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .
" and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . " how strange this is !
and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice .
oh , lydia ! "
" i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her .
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced .
he has children of his own , and may have more . how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
" if he were ever able to learn what wickham 's debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
" their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor anybody can ever forget .
it is useless to talk of it . "
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .
he was writing and , without raising his head , coolly replied :
" just as you please . "
" may we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
" take whatever you like , and get away . "
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table , and they went up stairs together .
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner 's hope of lydia 's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . to know that her daughter would be married was enough .
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
" my dear , dear lydia ! " she cried .
" this is delightful indeed ! she will be married !
i shall see her again !
she will be married at sixteen !
my good , kind brother !
i knew how it would be .
i knew he would manage everything !
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes !
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
stay , stay , i will go myself .
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .
i will put on my things in a moment .
my dear , dear lydia !
how merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under .
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure to his kindness .
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money . "
" well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents . well !
i am so happy ! in a short time i shall have a daughter married .
mrs. wickham !
how well it sounds !
and she was only sixteen last june .
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can 't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted .
one day 's delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
other schemes , too , came into her head .
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .
kitty , run down and order the carriage .
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .
girls , can i do anything for you in meryton ? oh !
here comes hill !
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . "
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .
poor lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
chapter 50
mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .
he now wished it more than ever .
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place .
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .
when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless , for , of course , they were to have a son .
the son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia 's birth , had been certain that he would .
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . this was one point , with regard to lydia , at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement .
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother 's hands , lydia 's expenses had been very little within that sum .
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
his letter was soon dispatched ; for , though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother , but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her .
the good news spread quickly through the house , and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .
to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farmhouse .
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband her misery was considered certain .
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings could quit it--or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for pulvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . but when they had withdrawn , he said to her : " mrs. bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .
into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance .
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . "
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm .
it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion .
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it . that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all she could believe possible .
she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place .
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means . there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of a sister 's frailty would have mortified her so much--not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself , for , at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .
had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where , to every other objection , would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned .
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . she was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been most gladly and gratefully received !
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex ; but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .
to mr. bennet 's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .
and i think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's .
it is mr. wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ---- ' s regiment , now quartered in the north .
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
he promises fairly ; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information ?
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south .
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--yours , etc . ,
" e. gardiner . "
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham 's removal from the ----shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .
but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it .
lydia 's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .
" she is so fond of mrs. forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away !
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ---- ' s regiment . "
his daughter 's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north .
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
chapter 51
their sister 's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it by dinner-time .
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets , and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
they came .
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them .
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
lydia 's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand , with an affectionate smile , to wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .
their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour .
there was no want of discourse .
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . "
her father lifted up his eyes . jane was distressed .
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day ?
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side-glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like anything . "
elizabeth could bear it no longer .
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . "
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .
her ease and good spirits increased .
she longed to see mrs. phillips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs. wickham " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to show her ring , and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ?
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .
i only hope they may have half my good luck . they must all go to brighton .
that is the place to get husbands . what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should . but my dear lydia , i don 't at all like your going such a way off .
must it be so ? "
" oh , lord ! yes ; --there is nothing in that .
i shall like it of all things .
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . "
" i should like it beyond anything ! " said her mother . " and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
" i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
wickham 's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him . she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth :
" lizzy , i never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , i believe . you were not by , when i told mamma and the others all about it .
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
" no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "
" la ! you are so strange !
but i must tell you how it went off .
we were married , you know , at st. clement 's , because wickham 's lodgings were in that parish .
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o 'clock . my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !
i was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . "
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
not one party , or scheme , or anything .
to be sure london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open . well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out .
however , i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . "
" mr. darcy ! " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .
" oh , yes ! --he was to come there with wickham , you know . but gracious me !
i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it .
i promised them so faithfully !
what will wickham say ?
it was to be such a secret ! "
" if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject . you may depend upon my seeking no further . "
" oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "
" thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . "
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
pray write instantly , and let me understand it--unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
" not that i _ shall _ , though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; --till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
chapter 52
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could .
she was no sooner in possession of it than , hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
" gracechurch street , sept . 6 .
" my dear niece ,
" i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _ you _ .
don 't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side .
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done .
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
" on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been .
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; wickham repeatedly , lydia once . from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world .
his character was to speak for itself . he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself .
if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
" there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town .
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction . they were in ---- street .
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . she cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham .
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design .
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia 's flight on her own folly alone .
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
" mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country .
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
" they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
" every thing being settled between _ them _ , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former .
he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
" on saturday he came again . your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
" they met again on sunday , and then _ i _ saw him too .
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
but our visitor was very obstinate .
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . he has been accused of many faults at different times , but _ this _ is the true one .
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
" they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
" you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased .
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody 's _ reserve , can be answerable for the event .
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair .
" when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
" i believe i have now told you every thing . it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . _ he _ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain .
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
" mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . i thought him very sly ; --he hardly ever mentioned your name .
but slyness seems the fashion . " pray forgive me if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .
" but i must write no more . the children have been wanting me this half hour .
" yours , very sincerely ,
" m. gardiner . "
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her . but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her--for a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
brother-in-law of wickham !
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
he had , to be sure , done much .
she was ashamed to think how much . but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing , to him .
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . she read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again .
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one 's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her .
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .
we were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
" true . are the others coming out ? "
" i do not know .
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .
and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . "
she replied in the affirmative .
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .
but of course she did not mention my name to you . "
" yes , she did . "
" and what did she say ? "
" that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had--not turned out well .
at such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said :
" i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .
we passed each other several times .
i wonder what he can be doing there . "
" perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth .
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "
" undoubtedly .
did you see him while you were at lambton ?
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . "
" yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
" and do you like her ? "
" very much . "
" i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .
i am very glad you liked her .
i hope she will turn out well . "
" i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
" did you go by the village of kympton ? "
" i do not recollect that we did . "
" i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .
a most delightful place ! --excellent parsonage house !
it would have suited me in every respect . "
" how should you have liked making sermons ? "
" exceedingly well .
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .
one ought not to repine ; --but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness !
but it was not to be .
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? "
" i have heard from authority , which i thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
" you have . yes , there was something in _ that _ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "
" i _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
" you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation .
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sister 's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile :
" come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .
do not let us quarrel about the past .
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . "
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .
chapter 53
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
" oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "
" oh , lord ! i don 't know .
not these two or three years , perhaps . "
" write to me very often , my dear . "
" as often as i can .
but you know married women have never much time for writing .
my sisters may write to _ me _ . they will have nothing else to do . "
mr. wickham 's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 's . he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw .
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
i am prodigiously proud of him . i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law . "
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .
" this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .
she looked at jane , and smiled and shook her head by turns .
" well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs. phillips first brought her the news ) .
" well , so much the better .
not that i care about it , though .
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _ i _ never want to see him again .
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .
and who knows what _ may _ happen ? but that is nothing to us .
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "
" you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .
she was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . "
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said :
" i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed . but don 't imagine it was from any silly cause .
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _ should _ be looked at .
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .
not that i am afraid of _ myself _ , but i dread other people 's remarks . "
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .
" as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs. bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "
" no , no .
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .
" ' tis an etiquette i despise , " said he . " if he wants our society , let him seek it .
he knows where we live . i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . "
" well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
but , however , that shan 't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did . as the day of his arrival drew near , -- " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister .
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much i suffer from what she says .
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! "
mr. bingley arrived .
mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could .
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house .
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window--she looked , --she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; " who can it be ? "
" la ! " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . mr. what 's-his-name . that tall , proud man . "
" good gracious !
mr. darcy ! --and so it does , i vow .
well , any friend of mr. bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
both sisters were uncomfortable enough . each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley 's friend , without being heard by either of them .
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley .
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .
but she would not be secure .
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance .
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .
he looked serious , as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .
but , perhaps he could not in her mother 's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .
darcy , after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything .
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed .
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she .
" yet why did he come ? "
" it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away , " said mrs. bennet .
he readily agreed to it . " i began to be afraid you would never come back again .
people _ did _ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .
miss lucas is married and settled . and one of my own daughters .
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq. to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
it was my brother gardiner 's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
did you see it ? "
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay i do not know how long .
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .
thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
a few weeks , he believed .
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennet 's manor .
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
elizabeth 's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
at that instant , she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . they then went away .
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
chapter 54
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
mr. darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her .
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . " he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?
if he fears me , why come hither ?
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?
teasing , teasing , man !
i will think no more about him . "
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which showed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .
i am glad he dines here on tuesday . it will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .
" oh , jane , take care . "
" my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? "
" i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived .
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .
he placed himself by her . elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane 's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them .
he was on one side of her mother . she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did .
her mother 's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth 's mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil .
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . " if he does not come to me , _ then _ , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever . "
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair .
and on the gentlemen 's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper :
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying :
" is your sister at pemberley still ? "
" yes , she will remain there till christmas . "
" and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? "
" mrs. annesley is with her . the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks . "
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .
when the tea-things were removed , and the card-tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .
she now lost every expectation of pleasure . they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch .
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases ' last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .
mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .
and what do you think she said besides ?
'ah !
mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last . '
she did indeed .
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . "
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth .
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .
i hope we may often meet again . "
elizabeth smiled .
" lizzy , you must not do so .
you must not suspect me . it mortifies me .
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .
i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . "
" you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
" but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "
chapter 55
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky . "
he should be particularly happy at any time , etc. etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
" can you come to-morrow ? "
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
he came , and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed .
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter 's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out :
" my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .
he is come--mr .
bingley is come .
he is , indeed .
make haste , make haste .
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . never mind miss lizzy 's hair . "
" we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "
" oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick !
where is your sash , my dear ? "
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening .
after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?
what do you keep winking at me for ?
what am i to do ? "
" nothing child , nothing .
i did not wink at you . "
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it .
in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half-opened the door and called out :
" lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "
elizabeth was forced to go .
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother , as soon as she was in the hall .
" kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room . "
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .
mrs. bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual .
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet 's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time . seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence .
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennet 's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes .
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all . their situation was awkward enough ; but _ hers _ she thought was still worse .
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
" ' tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much .
i do not deserve it .
oh ! why is not everybody as happy ? "
elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said for the present .
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself .
he is gone to my father already .
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! "
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
" where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door .
" with my mother up stairs . she will be down in a moment , i dare say . "
he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of jane 's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet 's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .
mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter , and said :
" jane , i congratulate you .
you will be a very happy woman . "
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
" you are a good girl ; " he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
your tempers are by no means unlike .
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
" i hope not so .
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . "
" exceed their income ! my dear mr. bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?
why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " then addressing her daughter , " oh ! my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !
i am sure i shan 't get a wink of sleep all night . i knew how it would be .
i always said it must be so , at last . i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept .
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
i had not believed it possible . "
" i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth .
" but how did he account for it ? "
" it must have been his sister 's doing . they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter .
good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley 's pretended regard . "
" would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ! "
" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane . " oh !
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !
if i could but see _ you _ as happy !
if there _ were _ but such another man for you ! "
" if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time . "
chapter 56
one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered . it was lady catherine de bourgh .
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth 's salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship 's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .
mrs. bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,
" i hope you are well , miss bennet .
that lady , i suppose , is your mother . "
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .
" and _ that _ i suppose is one of your sisters . "
" yes , madam , " said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to lady catherine .
" she is my youngest girl but one .
my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family . "
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence .
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas 's . "
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner , and then added :
" may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well . "
" yes , very well .
i saw them the night before last . "
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth ,
" miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
" go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and show her ladyship about the different walks .
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs .
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face .
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : --
" you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . "
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam . i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .
but however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so .
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago .
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy .
though i _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . "
" if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .
what could your ladyship propose by it ? "
" at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
" your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
" if !
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
" i never heard that it was . "
" and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "
" i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer . "
" this is not to be borne .
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
" it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .
you may have drawn him in . "
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "
" miss bennet , do you know who i am ?
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
" but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "
" let me be rightly understood .
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .
no , never .
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .
now what have you to say ? "
" only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied :
" the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .
it was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers .
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
" yes , and i had heard it before .
but what is that to me ?
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . its completion depended on others .
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? "
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
" these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth . " but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
" obstinate , headstrong girl !
i am ashamed of you !
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
is nothing due to me on that score ?
let us sit down .
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .
i have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
" _ that _ will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "
" i will not be interrupted . hear me in silence .
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient--though untitled--families .
their fortune on both sides is splendid .
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . is this to be endured !
but it must not , shall not be .
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . "
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
" true . you _ are _ a gentleman 's daughter .
but who was your mother ?
who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
" whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . "
" tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment 's deliberation :
" i am not . "
lady catherine seemed pleased .
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
" i will make no promise of the kind . "
" miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require . "
" and i certainly _ never _ shall give it .
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable ?
supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
" not so hasty , if you please .
i have by no means done .
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement .
i know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .
and is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ?
is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ?
heaven and earth ! --of what are you thinking ?
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
" you can now have nothing further to say , " she resentfully answered .
" you have insulted me in every possible method .
i must beg to return to the house . "
and she rose as she spoke .
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .
her ladyship was highly incensed .
" it is well .
you refuse , then , to oblige me .
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
" and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well . i shall now know how to act . do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . i came to try you . i hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , i will carry my point . "
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet . i send no compliments to your mother .
you deserve no such attention .
i am most seriously displeased . "
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "
" she is a very fine-looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? "
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
chapter 57
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
lady catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
it was a rational scheme , to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine ) , had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _ he _ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
in that case he would return no more .
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it . i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
the next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
he then said ,
" i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued :
" you look conscious . young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _ your _ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
this letter is from mr. collins . "
" from mr. collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? "
" something very much to the purpose of course .
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
what relates to yourself , is as follows : ' having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . '
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " ' this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , --splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ' " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out :
" ' my motive for cautioning you is as follows . we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ' " _ mr. darcy _ , you see , is the man !
now , lizzy , i think i _ have _ surprised you .
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
it is admirable ! "
elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
" are you not diverted ? "
" oh ! yes .
pray read on . "
" ' after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . '
mr. collins moreover adds , ' i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
you ought certainly to forgive them , as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . '
that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
you are not going to be _ missish _ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
" oh ! " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted . but it is so strange ! "
" yes-- _ that _ is what makes it amusing .
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
did she call to refuse her consent ? "
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
chapter 58
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
it was agreed to .
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking ; mary could never spare time ; but the remaining five set off together .
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other .
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said :
" mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding yours .
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
" i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
" you must not blame my aunt .
lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
" if you _ will _ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . but your _ family _ owe me nothing .
much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of _ you _ . "
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
after a short pause , her companion added ,
" you are too generous to trifle with me .
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . _ my _ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
they walked on , without knowing in what direction . there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give .
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . "
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of _ that _ .
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . it was unpardonable .
" we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth .
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . "
" i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' those were your words .
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; --though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
" i can easily believe it . you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
" oh ! do not repeat what i then said .
these recollections will not do at all . i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
darcy mentioned his letter . " did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ?
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
" when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
" the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . the adieu is charity itself .
but think no more of the letter . the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten .
you must learn some of my philosophy . think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
" i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
but with me , it is not so . painful recollections will intrude which cannot , which ought not , to be repelled .
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper .
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , i was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !
what do i not owe you !
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
by you , i was properly humbled .
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
" my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you . i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . how you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ? "
" hate you !
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at pemberley .
you blamed me for coming ? "
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise . "
" your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you .
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . "
" my object then , " replied darcy , " was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . "
he then told her of georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .
" what could become of mr. bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth .
" not at all .
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "
" that is to say , you had given your permission .
i guessed as much . "
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he , " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
his surprise was great .
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . " elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
" and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
" it did .
bingley is most unaffectedly modest . his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy .
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . he was angry .
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . he has heartily forgiven me now . "
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin .
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
in the hall they parted .
chapter 59
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary .
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
at night she opened her heart to jane .
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
" you are joking , lizzy .
this cannot be ! --engaged to mr. darcy !
no , no , you shall not deceive me . i know it to be impossible . "
" this is a wretched beginning indeed !
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . yet , indeed , i am in earnest .
i speak nothing but the truth . he still loves me , and we are engaged . "
jane looked at her doubtingly .
" oh , lizzy ! it cannot be . i know how much you dislike him . "
" you know nothing of the matter . _ that _ is all to be forgot .
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now . but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . "
miss bennet still looked all amazement .
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
" good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain ? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
" there can be no doubt of that .
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
but are you pleased , jane ?
shall you like to have such a brother ? "
" very , very much .
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
and do you really love him quite well enough ?
oh , lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
" oh , yes ! you will only think i feel _ more _ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "
" what do you mean ? "
" why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley .
i am afraid you will be angry . "
" my dearest sister , now _ be _ serious .
i want to talk very seriously .
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
" it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . "
another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish .
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .
i always had a value for him .
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it to another , not to you . "
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia 's marriage .
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
" good gracious ! " cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
i had no notion but he would go a-shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
what shall we do with him ?
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . "
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mrs. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? "
" i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs. bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . "
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr. bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . won 't it , kitty ? "
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying :
" i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her means--that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
she was gone directly .
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . " lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
have not you always hated him ? "
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
" or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
but will they make you happy ? "
" have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "
" none at all .
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
" i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .
indeed he has no improper pride . he is perfectly amiable .
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent .
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
i now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . but let me advise you to think better of it .
i know your disposition , lizzy .
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life .
you know not what you are about . "
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ' suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . if this be the case , he deserves you .
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
he heard her with astonishment .
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
so much the better . it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go--saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . "
elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
" good gracious !
lord bless me ! only think ! dear me !
mr. darcy !
who would have thought it !
and is it really true ?
oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be !
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !
jane 's is nothing to it--nothing at all .
i am so pleased--so happy .
such a charming man ! --so handsome ! so tall ! --oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . i hope he will overlook it .
dear , dear lizzy .
a house in town !
every thing that is charming !
three daughters married ! ten thousand a year !
oh , lord ! what will become of me .
i shall go distracted . "
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else !
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !
'tis as good as a lord !
and a special licence .
you must and shall be married by a special licence . but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . "
this was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
" i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , " said he .
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as jane 's . "
chapter 60
elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
" how could you begin ? " said she . " i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
it is too long ago .
i was in the middle before i knew that i _ had _ begun . "
" my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners--my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
" for the liveliness of your mind , i did . "
" you may as well call it impertinence at once . it was very little less .
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone .
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _ them _ . had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . "
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield ? "
" dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ?
but make a virtue of it by all means .
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
" because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
" but i was embarrassed . "
" and so was i. "
" you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
" a man who had felt less , might . "
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
but i wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . i wonder when you _ would _ have spoken , if i had not asked you !
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . _ too much _ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? for i ought not to have mentioned the subject . this will never do . "
" you need not distress yourself . the moral will be perfectly fair .
lady catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours . my aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing . "
" lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
" i am more likely to want more time than courage , elizabeth . but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
" and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner 's long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows :
" i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .
you supposed more than really existed .
but _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
your idea of the ponies is delightful . we will go round the park every day .
i am the happiest creature in the world .
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me .
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .
yours , etc . "
mr. darcy 's letter to lady catherine was in a different style ; and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .
" dear sir ,
" i must trouble you once more for congratulations . elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .
console lady catherine as well as you can .
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . he has more to give .
" yours sincerely , etc . "
miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother 's in sending it . four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
he bore it , however , with admirable calmness . he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. james 's , with very decent composure .
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
mrs. phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .
chapter 61
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed .
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
from the further disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone .
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . the letter was to this effect :
" my dear lizzy ,
" i wish you joy .
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .
" yours , etc . "
as it happened that elizabeth had _ much _ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .
pemberley was now georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . they were able to love each other even as well as they intended .
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
by elizabeth 's instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
but at length , by elizabeth 's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .

chapter i
there was no possibility of taking a walk that day .
we had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( mrs. reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out-door exercise was now out of the question .
i was glad of it : i never liked long walks , especially on chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight , with nipped fingers and toes , and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie , the nurse , and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza , john , and georgiana reed .
the said eliza , john , and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room : she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside , and with her darlings about her ( for the time neither quarrelling nor crying ) looked perfectly happy .
me , she had dispensed from joining the group ; saying , " she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children . "
" what does bessie say i have done ? " i asked .
" jane , i don 't like cavillers or questioners ; besides , there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner .
be seated somewhere ; and until you can speak pleasantly , remain silent . "
a breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room , i slipped in there .
it contained a bookcase : i soon possessed myself of a volume , taking care that it should be one stored with pictures .
i mounted into the window- seat : gathering up my feet , i sat cross-legged , like a turk ; and , having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close , i was shrined in double retirement .
folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand ; to the left were the clear panes of glass , protecting , but not separating me from the drear november day .
at intervals , while turning over the leaves of my book , i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon .
afar , it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud ; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub , with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast .
i returned to my book--bewick 's history of british birds : the letterpress thereof i cared little for , generally speaking ; and yet there were certain introductory pages that , child as i was , i could not pass quite as a blank .
they were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl ; of " the solitary rocks and promontories " by them only inhabited ; of the coast of norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the lindeness , or naze , to the north cape-- " where the northern ocean , in vast whirls , boils round the naked , melancholy isles of farthest thule ; and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides . "
nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of lapland , siberia , spitzbergen , nova zembla , iceland , greenland , with " the vast sweep of the arctic zone , and those forlorn regions of dreary space , --that reservoir of frost and snow , where firm fields of ice , the accumulation of centuries of winters , glazed in alpine heights above heights , surround the pole , and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold . "
of these death-white realms i formed an idea of my own : shadowy , like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children 's brains , but strangely impressive .
the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .
each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up mrs. reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period i discovered ) from the pages of pamela , and henry , earl of moreland .
with bewick on my knee , i was then happy : happy at least in my way . i feared nothing but interruption , and that came too soon .
the breakfast- room door opened .
" boh ! madam mope ! " cried the voice of john reed ; then he paused : he found the room apparently empty .
" where the dickens is she ! " he continued .
" lizzy ! georgy ! ( calling to his sisters ) joan is not here : tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad animal ! "
" it is well i drew the curtain , " thought i ; and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would john reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once--
" she is in the window-seat , to be sure , jack . "
and i came out immediately , for i trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said jack .
" what do you want ? " i asked , with awkward diffidence .
" say , ' what do you want , master reed ? ' " was the answer .
" i want you to come here ; " and seating himself in an arm-chair , he intimated by a gesture that i was to approach and stand before him .
john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than i , for i was but ten : large and stout for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .
he gorged himself habitually at table , which made him bilious , and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks .
he ought now to have been at school ; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two , " on account of his delicate health . "
mr. miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned from an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that john 's sallowness was owing to over-application and , perhaps , to pining after home .
john had not much affection for his mother and sisters , and an antipathy to me .
he bullied and punished me ; not two or three times in the week , nor once or twice in the day , but continually : every nerve i had feared him , and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near .
there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and mrs. reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .
habitually obedient to john , i came up to his chair : he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots : i knew he would soon strike , and while dreading the blow , i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it .
i wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , all at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly .
i tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair .
" that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since , " said he , " and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains , and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since , you rat ! "
accustomed to john reed 's abuse , i never had an idea of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult .
" what were you doing behind the curtain ? " he asked .
" i was reading . "
" show the book . "
i returned to the window and fetched it thence .
" you have no business to take our books ; you are a dependent , mama says ; you have no money ; your father left you none ; you ought to beg , and not to live here with gentlemen 's children like us , and eat the same meals we do , and wear clothes at our mama 's expense .
now , i 'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves : for they _ are _ mine ; all the house belongs to me , or will do in a few years . go and stand by the door , out of the way of the mirror and the windows . "
i did so , not at first aware what was his intention ; but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it , i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm : not soon enough , however ; the volume was flung , it hit me , and i fell , striking my head against the door and cutting it .
the cut bled , the pain was sharp : my terror had passed its climax ; other feelings succeeded .
" wicked and cruel boy ! " i said . " you are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the roman emperors ! "
i had read goldsmith 's history of rome , and had formed my opinion of nero , caligula , & c . also i had drawn parallels in silence , which i never thought thus to have declared aloud .
" what ! what ! " he cried . " did she say that to me ? did you hear her , eliza and georgiana ?
won 't i tell mama ? but first-- " he ran headlong at me : i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder : he had closed with a desperate thing .
i really saw in him a tyrant , a murderer . i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck , and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering : these sensations for the time predominated over fear , and i received him in frantic sort .
aid was near him : eliza and georgiana had run for mrs. reed , who was gone upstairs : she now came upon the scene , followed by bessie and her maid abbot .
we were parted : i heard the words-- " dear ! dear ! what a fury to fly at master john ! "
" did ever anybody see such a picture of passion ! "
then mrs. reed subjoined--
" take her away to the red-room , and lock her in there . "
four hands were immediately laid upon me , and i was borne upstairs .
chapter ii
i resisted all the way : a new thing for me , and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me .
the fact is , i was a trifle beside myself ; or rather _ out _ of myself , as the french would say : i was conscious that a moment 's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties , and , like any other rebel slave , i felt resolved , in my desperation , to go all lengths .
" hold her arms , miss abbot : she 's like a mad cat . "
" for shame ! for shame ! " cried the lady 's-maid .
" what shocking conduct , miss eyre , to strike a young gentleman , your benefactress 's son !
your young master . "
" master !
how is he my master ?
am i a servant ? "
" no ; you are less than a servant , for you do nothing for your keep .
there , sit down , and think over your wickedness . "
they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs. reed , and had thrust me upon a stool : my impulse was to rise from it like a spring ; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly .
" if you don 't sit still , you must be tied down , " said bessie .
" miss abbot , lend me your garters ; she would break mine directly . "
miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature .
this preparation for bonds , and the additional ignominy it inferred , took a little of the excitement out of me .
" don 't take them off , " i cried ; " i will not stir . "
in guarantee whereof , i attached myself to my seat by my hands .
" mind you don 't , " said bessie ; and when she had ascertained that i was really subsiding , she loosened her hold of me ; then she and miss abbot stood with folded arms , looking darkly and doubtfully on my face , as incredulous of my sanity .
" she never did so before , " at last said bessie , turning to the abigail .
" but it was always in her , " was the reply . " i 've told missis often my opinion about the child , and missis agreed with me . she 's an underhand little thing : i never saw a girl of her age with so much cover . "
bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said-- " you ought to be aware , miss , that you are under obligations to mrs. reed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you off , you would have to go to the poorhouse . "
i had nothing to say to these words : they were not new to me : my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind .
this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear : very painful and crushing , but only half intelligible .
miss abbot joined in-- " and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed , because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them .
they will have a great deal of money , and you will have none : it is your place to be humble , and to try to make yourself agreeable to them . "
" what we tell you is for your good , " added bessie , in no harsh voice , " you should try to be useful and pleasant , then , perhaps , you would have a home here ; but if you become passionate and rude , missis will send you away , i am sure . "
" besides , " said miss abbot , " god will punish her : he might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums , and then where would she go ?
come , bessie , we will leave her : i wouldn 't have her heart for anything .
say your prayers , miss eyre , when you are by yourself ; for if you don 't repent , something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away . "
they went , shutting the door , and locking it behind them .
the red-room was a square chamber , very seldom slept in , i might say never , indeed , unless when a chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained : yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion .
a bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany , hung with curtains of deep red damask , stood out like a tabernacle in the centre ; the two large windows , with their blinds always drawn down , were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery ; the carpet was red ; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth ; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it ; the wardrobe , the toilet-table , the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany .
out of these deep surrounding shades rose high , and glared white , the piled- up mattresses and pillows of the bed , spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane .
scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed , also white , with a footstool before it ; and looking , as i thought , like a pale throne .
this room was chill , because it seldom had a fire ; it was silent , because remote from the nursery and kitchen ; solemn , because it was known to be so seldom entered .
the house-maid alone came here on saturdays , to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week 's quiet dust : and mrs. reed herself , at far intervals , visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe , where were stored divers parchments , her jewel-casket , and a miniature of her deceased husband ; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur .
mr. reed had been dead nine years : it was in this chamber he breathed his last ; here he lay in state ; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker 's men ; and , since that day , a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion .
my seat , to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left me riveted , was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece ; the bed rose before me ; to my right hand there was the high , dark wardrobe , with subdued , broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels ; to my left were the muffled windows ; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room .
i was not quite sure whether they had locked the door ; and when i dared move , i got up and went to see .
alas ! yes : no jail was ever more secure .
returning , i had to cross before the looking- glass ; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed .
all looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality : and the strange little figure there gazing at me , with a white face and arms specking the gloom , and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still , had the effect of a real spirit : i thought it like one of the tiny phantoms , half fairy , half imp , bessie 's evening stories represented as coming out of lone , ferny dells in moors , and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers . i returned to my stool .
superstition was with me at that moment ; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory : my blood was still warm ; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour ; i had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to the dismal present .
all john reed 's violent tyrannies , all his sisters ' proud indifference , all his mother 's aversion , all the servants ' partiality , turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well .
why was i always suffering , always browbeaten , always accused , for ever condemned ?
why could i never please ?
why was it useless to try to win any one 's favour ?
eliza , who was headstrong and selfish , was respected . georgiana , who had a spoiled temper , a very acrid spite , a captious and insolent carriage , was universally indulged . her beauty , her pink cheeks and golden curls , seemed to give delight to all who looked at her , and to purchase indemnity for every fault .
john no one thwarted , much less punished ; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons , killed the little pea-chicks , set the dogs at the sheep , stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit , and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory : he called his mother " old girl , " too ; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin , similar to his own ; bluntly disregarded her wishes ; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire ; and he was still " her own darling . "
i dared commit no fault : i strove to fulfil every duty ; and i was termed naughty and tiresome , sullen and sneaking , from morning to noon , and from noon to night .
my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received : no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me ; and because i had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence , i was loaded with general opprobrium .
" unjust ! --unjust ! " said my reason , forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power : and resolve , equally wrought up , instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away , or , if that could not be effected , never eating or drinking more , and letting myself die .
what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon ! how all my brain was in tumult , and all my heart in insurrection !
yet in what darkness , what dense ignorance , was the mental battle fought ! i could not answer the ceaseless inward question-- _ why _ i thus suffered ; now , at the distance of--i will not say how many years , i see it clearly .
i was a discord in gateshead hall : i was like nobody there ; i had nothing in harmony with mrs. reed or her children , or her chosen vassalage .
if they did not love me , in fact , as little did i love them .
they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them ; a heterogeneous thing , opposed to them in temperament , in capacity , in propensities ; a useless thing , incapable of serving their interest , or adding to their pleasure ; a noxious thing , cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment , of contempt of their judgment .
i know that had i been a sanguine , brilliant , careless , exacting , handsome , romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--mrs .
reed would have endured my presence more complacently ; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling ; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery .
daylight began to forsake the red-room ; it was past four o 'clock , and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight . i heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window , and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall ; i grew by degrees cold as a stone , and then my courage sank .
my habitual mood of humiliation , self-doubt , forlorn depression , fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire .
all said i was wicked , and perhaps i might be so ; what thought had i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death ?
that certainly was a crime : and was i fit to die ? or was the vault under the chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne ?
in such vault i had been told did mr. reed lie buried ; and led by this thought to recall his idea , i dwelt on it with gathering dread .
i could not remember him ; but i knew that he was my own uncle--my mother 's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house ; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs. reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children .
mrs. reed probably considered she had kept this promise ; and so she had , i dare say , as well as her nature would permit her ; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race , and unconnected with her , after her husband 's death , by any tie ?
it must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love , and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group .
a singular notion dawned upon me . i doubted not--never doubted--that if mr. reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly ; and now , as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--i began to recall what i had heard of dead men , troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes , revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed ; and i thought mr. reed 's spirit , harassed by the wrongs of his sister 's child , might quit its abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed--and rise before me in this chamber .
i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs , fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me , or elicit from the gloom some haloed face , bending over me with strange pity .
this idea , consolatory in theory , i felt would be terrible if realised : with all my might i endeavoured to stifle it--i endeavoured to be firm .
shaking my hair from my eyes , i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .
was it , i asked myself , a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?
no ; moonlight was still , and this stirred ; while i gazed , it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head .
i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .
steps came running along the outer passage ; the key turned , bessie and abbot entered .
" miss eyre , are you ill ? " said bessie .
" what a dreadful noise ! it went quite through me ! " exclaimed abbot .
" take me out ! let me go into the nursery ! " was my cry .
" what for ?
are you hurt ? have you seen something ? " again demanded bessie .
" oh ! i saw a light , and i thought a ghost would come . "
i had now got hold of bessie 's hand , and she did not snatch it from me .
" she has screamed out on purpose , " declared abbot , in some disgust . " and what a scream !
if she had been in great pain one would have excused it , but she only wanted to bring us all here : i know her naughty tricks . "
" what is all this ? " demanded another voice peremptorily ; and mrs. reed came along the corridor , her cap flying wide , her gown rustling stormily .
" abbot and bessie , i believe i gave orders that jane eyre should be left in the red-room till i came to her myself . "
" miss jane screamed so loud , ma 'am , " pleaded bessie .
" let her go , " was the only answer .
" loose bessie 's hand , child : you cannot succeed in getting out by these means , be assured .
i abhor artifice , particularly in children ; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer : you will now stay here an hour longer , and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then . " " o aunt ! have pity !
forgive me ! i cannot endure it--let me be punished some other way ! i shall be killed if-- "
" silence ! this violence is all most repulsive : " and so , no doubt , she felt it .
i was a precocious actress in her eyes ; she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions , mean spirit , and dangerous duplicity .
bessie and abbot having retreated , mrs. reed , impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs , abruptly thrust me back and locked me in , without farther parley .
i heard her sweeping away ; and soon after she was gone , i suppose i had a species of fit : unconsciousness closed the scene .
chapter iii
the next thing i remember is , waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare , and seeing before me a terrible red glare , crossed with thick black bars .
i heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .
ere long , i became aware that some one was handling me ; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than i had ever been raised or upheld before . i rested my head against a pillow or an arm , and felt easy .
in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved : i knew quite well that i was in my own bed , and that the red glare was the nursery fire .
it was night : a candle burnt on the table ; bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her hand , and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow , leaning over me .
i felt an inexpressible relief , a soothing conviction of protection and security , when i knew that there was a stranger in the room , an individual not belonging to gateshead , and not related to mrs. reed .
turning from bessie ( though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of abbot , for instance , would have been ) , i scrutinised the face of the gentleman : i knew him ; it was mr. lloyd , an apothecary , sometimes called in by mrs. reed when the servants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed a physician .
" well , who am i ? " he asked .
i pronounced his name , offering him at the same time my hand : he took it , smiling and saying , " we shall do very well by-and-by . "
then he laid me down , and addressing bessie , charged her to be very careful that i was not disturbed during the night .
having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .
" do you feel as if you should sleep , miss ? " asked bessie , rather softly .
scarcely dared i answer her ; for i feared the next sentence might be rough . " i will try . "
" would you like to drink , or could you eat anything ? "
" no , thank you , bessie . "
" then i think i shall go to bed , for it is past twelve o 'clock ; but you may call me if you want anything in the night . "
wonderful civility this !
it emboldened me to ask a question .
" bessie , what is the matter with me ? am i ill ? "
" you fell sick , i suppose , in the red-room with crying ; you 'll be better soon , no doubt . "
bessie went into the housemaid 's apartment , which was near . i heard her say--
" sarah , come and sleep with me in the nursery ; i daren 't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night : she might die ; it 's such a strange thing she should have that fit : i wonder if she saw anything .
missis was rather too hard . "
sarah came back with her ; they both went to bed ; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep .
i caught scraps of their conversation , from which i was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed .
" something passed her , all dressed in white , and vanished " -- " a great black dog behind him " -- " three loud raps on the chamber door " -- " a light in the churchyard just over his grave , " & c . & c .
at last both slept : the fire and the candle went out .
for me , the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness ; strained by dread : such dread as children only can feel .
no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red- room ; it only gave my nerves a shock of which i feel the reverberation to this day .
yes , mrs. reed , to you i owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering , but i ought to forgive you , for you knew not what you did : while rending my heart-strings , you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities .
next day , by noon , i was up and dressed , and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth .
i felt physically weak and broken down : but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind : a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears ; no sooner had i wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed . yet , i thought , i ought to have been happy , for none of the reeds were there , they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama .
abbot , too , was sewing in another room , and bessie , as she moved hither and thither , putting away toys and arranging drawers , addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness .
this state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace , accustomed as i was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging ; but , in fact , my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe , and no pleasure excite them agreeably .
bessie had been down into the kitchen , and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate , whose bird of paradise , nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds , had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration ; and which plate i had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely , but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege . this precious vessel was now placed on my knee , and i was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it . vain favour ! coming , like most other favours long deferred and often wished for , too late !
i could not eat the tart ; and the plumage of the bird , the tints of the flowers , seemed strangely faded : i put both plate and tart away .
bessie asked if i would have a book : the word _ book _ acted as a transient stimulus , and i begged her to fetch gulliver 's travels from the library .
this book i had again and again perused with delight .
i considered it a narrative of facts , and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what i found in fairy tales : for as to the elves , having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells , under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks , i had at length made up my mind to the sad truth , that they were all gone out of england to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker , and the population more scant ; whereas , lilliput and brobdignag being , in my creed , solid parts of the earth 's surface , i doubted not that i might one day , by taking a long voyage , see with my own eyes the little fields , houses , and trees , the diminutive people , the tiny cows , sheep , and birds of the one realm ; and the corn-fields forest-high , the mighty mastiffs , the monster cats , the tower-like men and women , of the other .
yet , when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when i turned over its leaves , and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm i had , till now , never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary ; the giants were gaunt goblins , the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps , gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions .
i closed the book , which i dared no longer peruse , and put it on the table , beside the untasted tart .
bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room , and having washed her hands , she opened a certain little drawer , full of splendid shreds of silk and satin , and began making a new bonnet for georgiana 's doll .
meantime she sang : her song was--
" in the days when we went gipsying , a long time ago . "
i had often heard the song before , and always with lively delight ; for bessie had a sweet voice , --at least , i thought so . but now , though her voice was still sweet , i found in its melody an indescribable sadness .
sometimes , preoccupied with her work , she sang the refrain very low , very lingeringly ; " a long time ago " came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn .
she passed into another ballad , this time a really doleful one .
" my feet they are sore , and my limbs they are weary ; long is the way , and the mountains are wild ; soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary over the path of the poor orphan child .
why did they send me so far and so lonely , up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled ?
men are hard-hearted , and kind angels only watch o 'er the steps of a poor orphan child .
yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing , clouds there are none , and clear stars beam mild , god , in his mercy , protection is showing , comfort and hope to the poor orphan child .
ev 'n should i fall o 'er the broken bridge passing , or stray in the marshes , by false lights beguiled , still will my father , with promise and blessing , take to his bosom the poor orphan child .
there is a thought that for strength should avail me , though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ; heaven is a home , and a rest will not fail me ; god is a friend to the poor orphan child . "
" come , miss jane , don 't cry , " said bessie as she finished .
she might as well have said to the fire , " don 't burn ! " but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which i was a prey ?
in the course of the morning mr. lloyd came again .
" what , already up ! " said he , as he entered the nursery .
" well , nurse , how is she ? "
bessie answered that i was doing very well .
" then she ought to look more cheerful .
come here , miss jane : your name is jane , is it not ? "
" yes , sir , jane eyre . "
" well , you have been crying , miss jane eyre ; can you tell me what about ?
have you any pain ? "
" no , sir . " " oh !
i daresay she is crying because she could not go out with missis in the carriage , " interposed bessie .
" surely not ! why , she is too old for such pettishness . "
i thought so too ; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge , i answered promptly , " i never cried for such a thing in my life : i hate going out in the carriage . i cry because i am miserable . "
" oh fie , miss ! " said bessie .
the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled .
i was standing before him ; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily : his eyes were small and grey ; not very bright , but i dare say i should think them shrewd now : he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face .
having considered me at leisure , he said--
" what made you ill yesterday ? "
" she had a fall , " said bessie , again putting in her word .
" fall ! why , that is like a baby again !
can 't she manage to walk at her age ?
she must be eight or nine years old . "
" i was knocked down , " was the blunt explanation , jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride ; " but that did not make me ill , " i added ; while mr. lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff .
as he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket , a loud bell rang for the servants ' dinner ; he knew what it was .
" that 's for you , nurse , " said he ; " you can go down ; i 'll give miss jane a lecture till you come back . "
bessie would rather have stayed , but she was obliged to go , because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at gateshead hall .
" the fall did not make you ill ; what did , then ? " pursued mr. lloyd when bessie was gone .
" i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark . "
i saw mr. lloyd smile and frown at the same time .
" ghost ! what , you are a baby after all ! you are afraid of ghosts ? "
" of mr. reed 's ghost i am : he died in that room , and was laid out there .
neither bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle , --so cruel that i think i shall never forget it . "
" nonsense ! and is it that makes you so miserable ?
are you afraid now in daylight ? "
" no : but night will come again before long : and besides , --i am unhappy , --very unhappy , for other things . "
" what other things ?
can you tell me some of them ? "
how much i wished to reply fully to this question ! how difficult it was to frame any answer !
children can feel , but they cannot analyse their feelings ; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought , they know not how to express the result of the process in words .
fearful , however , of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it , i , after a disturbed pause , contrived to frame a meagre , though , as far as it went , true response .
" for one thing , i have no father or mother , brothers or sisters . "
" you have a kind aunt and cousins . "
again i paused ; then bunglingly enounced--
" but john reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red-room . "
mr. lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box .
" don 't you think gateshead hall a very beautiful house ? " asked he . " are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at ? "
" it is not my house , sir ; and abbot says i have less right to be here than a servant . "
" pooh ! you can 't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place ? "
" if i had anywhere else to go , i should be glad to leave it ; but i can never get away from gateshead till i am a woman . "
" perhaps you may--who knows ?
have you any relations besides mrs. reed ? "
" i think not , sir . "
" none belonging to your father ? "
" i don 't know . i asked aunt reed once , and she said possibly i might have some poor , low relations called eyre , but she knew nothing about them . "
" if you had such , would you like to go to them ? "
i reflected .
poverty looks grim to grown people ; still more so to children : they have not much idea of industrious , working , respectable poverty ; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes , scanty food , fireless grates , rude manners , and debasing vices : poverty for me was synonymous with degradation .
" no ; i should not like to belong to poor people , " was my reply .
" not even if they were kind to you ? "
i shook my head : i could not see how poor people had the means of being kind ; and then to learn to speak like them , to adopt their manners , to be uneducated , to grow up like one of the poor women i saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead : no , i was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste .
" but are your relatives so very poor ?
are they working people ? "
" i cannot tell ; aunt reed says if i have any , they must be a beggarly set : i should not like to go a begging . "
" would you like to go to school ? "
again i reflected : i scarcely knew what school was : bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks , wore backboards , and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise : john reed hated his school , and abused his master ; but john reed 's tastes were no rule for mine , and if bessie 's accounts of school-discipline ( gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to gateshead ) were somewhat appalling , her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were , i thought , equally attractive .
she boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed ; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play , of purses they could net , of french books they could translate ; till my spirit was moved to emulation as i listened .
besides , school would be a complete change : it implied a long journey , an entire separation from gateshead , an entrance into a new life .
" i should indeed like to go to school , " was the audible conclusion of my musings .
" well , well ! who knows what may happen ? " said mr. lloyd , as he got up .
" the child ought to have change of air and scene , " he added , speaking to himself ; " nerves not in a good state . "
bessie now returned ; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk .
" is that your mistress , nurse ? " asked mr. lloyd .
" i should like to speak to her before i go . "
bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room , and led the way out .
in the interview which followed between him and mrs. reed , i presume , from after-occurrences , that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school ; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted ; for as abbot said , in discussing the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night , after i was in bed , and , as they thought , asleep , " missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill-conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand . "
abbot , i think , gave me credit for being a sort of infantine guy fawkes .
on that same occasion i learned , for the first time , from miss abbot 's communications to bessie , that my father had been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends , who considered the match beneath her ; that my grandfather reed was so irritated at her disobedience , he cut her off without a shilling ; that after my mother and father had been married a year , the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated , and where that disease was then prevalent : that my mother took the infection from him , and both died within a month of each other .
bessie , when she heard this narrative , sighed and said , " poor miss jane is to be pitied , too , abbot . "
" yes , " responded abbot ; " if she were a nice , pretty child , one might compassionate her forlornness ; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that . "
" not a great deal , to be sure , " agreed bessie : " at any rate , a beauty like miss georgiana would be more moving in the same condition . " " yes , i doat on miss georgiana ! " cried the fervent abbot .
" little darling ! --with her long curls and her blue eyes , and such a sweet colour as she has ; just as if she were painted ! --bessie , i could fancy a welsh rabbit for supper . "
" so could i--with a roast onion . come , we 'll go down . "
they went .
chapter iv
from my discourse with mr. lloyd , and from the above reported conference between bessie and abbot , i gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well : a change seemed near , --i desired and waited it in silence .
it tarried , however : days and weeks passed : i had regained my normal state of health , but no new allusion was made to the subject over which i brooded .
mrs. reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
not a hint , however , did she drop about sending me to school : still i felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her ; for her glance , now more than ever , when turned on me , expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion .
eliza and georgiana , evidently acting according to orders , spoke to me as little as possible : john thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me , and once attempted chastisement ; but as i instantly turned against him , roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before , he thought it better to desist , and ran from me tittering execrations , and vowing i had burst his nose .
i had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and when i saw that either that or my look daunted him , i had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose ; but he was already with his mama . i heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how " that nasty jane eyre " had flown at him like a mad cat : he was stopped rather harshly--
" don 't talk to me about her , john : i told you not to go near her ; she is not worthy of notice ; i do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her . "
here , leaning over the banister , i cried out suddenly , and without at all deliberating on my words--
" they are not fit to associate with me . "
mrs. reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , and crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .
" what would uncle reed say to you , if he were alive ? " was my scarcely voluntary demand .
i say scarcely voluntary , for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance : something spoke out of me over which i had no control .
" what ? " said mrs. reed under her breath : her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear ; she took her hand from my arm , and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether i were child or fiend .
i was now in for it .
" my uncle reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you shut me up all day long , and how you wish me dead . "
mrs. reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , she boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .
bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour 's length , in which she proved beyond a doubt that i was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof .
i half believed her ; for i felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast .
november , december , and half of january passed away .
christmas and the new year had been celebrated at gateshead with the usual festive cheer ; presents had been interchanged , dinners and evening parties given .
from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing-room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed .
when tired of this occupation , i would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery : there , though somewhat sad , i was not miserable . to speak truth , i had not the least wish to go into company , for in company i was very rarely noticed ; and if bessie had but been kind and companionable , i should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her , instead of passing them under the formidable eye of mrs. reed , in a room full of ladies and gentlemen .
but bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her . i then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low , glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room ; and when the embers sank to a dull red , i undressed hastily , tugging at knots and strings as i best might , and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib .
to this crib i always took my doll ; human beings must love something , and , in the dearth of worthier objects of affection , i contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image , shabby as a miniature scarecrow .
it puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity i doated on this little toy , half fancying it alive and capable of sensation . i could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown ; and when it lay there safe and warm , i was comparatively happy , believing it to be happy likewise .
long did the hours seem while i waited the departure of the company , and listened for the sound of bessie 's step on the stairs : sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors , or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while i ate it , and when i had finished , she would tuck the clothes round me , and twice she kissed me , and said , " good night , miss jane . "
when thus gentle , bessie seemed to me the best , prettiest , kindest being in the world ; and i wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable , and never push me about , or scold , or task me unreasonably , as she was too often wont to do .
bessie lee must , i think , have been a girl of good natural capacity , for she was smart in all she did , and had a remarkable knack of narrative ; so , at least , i judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales .
she was pretty too , if my recollections of her face and person are correct .
i remember her as a slim young woman , with black hair , dark eyes , very nice features , and good , clear complexion ; but she had a capricious and hasty temper , and indifferent ideas of principle or justice : still , such as she was , i preferred her to any one else at gateshead hall .
it was the fifteenth of january , about nine o 'clock in the morning : bessie was gone down to breakfast ; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama ; eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry , an occupation of which she was fond : and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained .
she had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from mrs. reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .
as to her money , she first secreted it in odd corners , wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper ; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid , eliza , fearful of one day losing her valued treasure , consented to intrust it to her mother , at a usurious rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent . ; which interest she exacted every quarter , keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy .
georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .
i was making my bed , having received strict orders from bessie to get it arranged before she returned ( for bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under- nurserymaid , to tidy the room , dust the chairs , & c . ) .
having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress , i went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll 's house furniture scattered there ; an abrupt command from georgiana to let her playthings alone ( for the tiny chairs and mirrors , the fairy plates and cups , were her property ) stopped my proceedings ; and then , for lack of other occupation , i fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted , and thus clearing a space in the glass through which i might look out on the grounds , where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost .
from this window were visible the porter 's lodge and the carriage-road , and just as i had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out , i saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through .
i watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom i was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door-bell rang loudly , the new-comer was admitted .
all this being nothing to me , my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin , which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement .
the remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table , and having crumbled a morsel of roll , i was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill , when bessie came running upstairs into the nursery .
" miss jane , take off your pinafore ; what are you doing there ?
have you washed your hands and face this morning ? "
i gave another tug before i answered , for i wanted the bird to be secure of its bread : the sash yielded ; i scattered the crumbs , some on the stone sill , some on the cherry-tree bough , then , closing the window , i replied--
" no , bessie ; i have only just finished dusting . "
" troublesome , careless child ! and what are you doing now ?
you look quite red , as if you had been about some mischief : what were you opening the window for ? "
i was spared the trouble of answering , for bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations ; she hauled me to the washstand , inflicted a merciless , but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap , water , and a coarse towel ; disciplined my head with a bristly brush , denuded me of my pinafore , and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs , bid me go down directly , as i was wanted in the breakfast-room .
i would have asked who wanted me : i would have demanded if mrs. reed was there ; but bessie was already gone , and had closed the nursery-door upon me .
i slowly descended .
for nearly three months , i had never been called to mrs. reed 's presence ; restricted so long to the nursery , the breakfast , dining , and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions , on which it dismayed me to intrude .
i now stood in the empty hall ; before me was the breakfast-room door , and i stopped , intimidated and trembling .
what a miserable little poltroon had fear , engendered of unjust punishment , made of me in those days !
i feared to return to the nursery , and feared to go forward to the parlour ; ten minutes i stood in agitated hesitation ; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me ; i _ must _ enter .
" who could want me ? " i asked inwardly , as with both hands i turned the stiff door-handle , which , for a second or two , resisted my efforts .
" what should i see besides aunt reed in the apartment ? --a man or a woman ? "
the handle turned , the door unclosed , and passing through and curtseying low , i looked up at--a black pillar ! --such , at least , appeared to me , at first sight , the straight , narrow , sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug : the grim face at the top was like a carved mask , placed above the shaft by way of capital .
mrs. reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside ; she made a signal to me to approach ; i did so , and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words : " this is the little girl respecting whom i applied to you . "
_ he _ , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where i stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , " her size is small : what is her age ? "
" ten years . "
" so much ? " was the doubtful answer ; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes . presently he addressed me-- " your name , little girl ? "
" jane eyre , sir . "
in uttering these words i looked up : he seemed to me a tall gentleman ; but then i was very little ; his features were large , and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim .
" well , jane eyre , and are you a good child ? "
impossible to reply to this in the affirmative : my little world held a contrary opinion : i was silent .
mrs. reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , " perhaps the less said on that subject the better , mr. brocklehurst . "
" sorry indeed to hear it ! she and i must have some talk ; " and bending from the perpendicular , he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite mrs. reed 's .
" come here , " he said .
i stepped across the rug ; he placed me square and straight before him .
what a face he had , now that it was almost on a level with mine ! what a great nose ! and what a mouth ! and what large prominent teeth !
" no sight so sad as that of a naughty child , " he began , " especially a naughty little girl .
do you know where the wicked go after death ? "
" they go to hell , " was my ready and orthodox answer .
" and what is hell ? can you tell me that ? "
" a pit full of fire . "
" and should you like to fall into that pit , and to be burning there for ever ? "
" no , sir . "
" what must you do to avoid it ? "
i deliberated a moment ; my answer , when it did come , was objectionable : " i must keep in good health , and not die . "
" how can you keep in good health ? children younger than you die daily .
i buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since , --a good little child , whose soul is now in heaven . it is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence . "
not being in a condition to remove his doubt , i only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug , and sighed , wishing myself far enough away .
" i hope that sigh is from the heart , and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress . "
" benefactress ! benefactress ! " said i inwardly : " they all call mrs. reed my benefactress ; if so , a benefactress is a disagreeable thing . "
" do you say your prayers night and morning ? " continued my interrogator .
" yes , sir . "
" do you read your bible ? "
" sometimes . "
" with pleasure ? are you fond of it ? "
" i like revelations , and the book of daniel , and genesis and samuel , and a little bit of exodus , and some parts of kings and chronicles , and job and jonah . "
" and the psalms ? i hope you like them ? "
" no , sir . "
" no ? oh , shocking !
i have a little boy , younger than you , who knows six psalms by heart : and when you ask him which he would rather have , a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn , he says : ' oh ! the verse of a psalm ! angels sing psalms ; ' says he , ' i wish to be a little angel here below ; ' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety . "
" psalms are not interesting , " i remarked .
" that proves you have a wicked heart ; and you must pray to god to change it : to give you a new and clean one : to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh . "
i was about to propound a question , touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed , when mrs. reed interposed , telling me to sit down ; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself .
" mr. brocklehurst , i believe i intimated in the letter which i wrote to you three weeks ago , that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition i could wish : should you admit her into lowood school , i should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her , and , above all , to guard against her worst fault , a tendency to deceit .
i mention this in your hearing , jane , that you may not attempt to impose on mr. brocklehurst . "
well might i dread , well might i dislike mrs. reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was i happy in her presence ; however carefully i obeyed , however strenuously i strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
now , uttered before a stranger , the accusation cut me to the heart ; i dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter ; i felt , though i could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ; i saw myself transformed under mr. brocklehurst 's eye into an artful , noxious child , and what could i do to remedy the injury ?
" nothing , indeed , " thought i , as i struggled to repress a sob , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .
" deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , " said mr. brocklehurst ; " it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , mrs. reed . i will speak to miss temple and the teachers . "
" i should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects , " continued my benefactress ; " to be made useful , to be kept humble : as for the vacations , she will , with your permission , spend them always at lowood . "
" your decisions are perfectly judicious , madam , " returned mr. brocklehurst . " humility is a christian grace , and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of lowood ; i , therefore , direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them .
i have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; and , only the other day , i had a pleasing proof of my success .
my second daughter , augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : ' oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls at lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people 's children ! and , ' said she , ' they looked at my dress and mama 's , as if they had never seen a silk gown before . ' "
" this is the state of things i quite approve , " returned mrs. reed ; " had i sought all england over , i could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like jane eyre .
consistency , my dear mr. brocklehurst ; i advocate consistency in all things . "
" consistency , madam , is the first of christian duties ; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of lowood : plain fare , simple attire , unsophisticated accommodations , hardy and active habits ; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants . "
" quite right , sir . i may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at lowood , and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects ? "
" madam , you may : she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants , and i trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election . "
" i will send her , then , as soon as possible , mr. brocklehurst ; for , i assure you , i feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome . "
" no doubt , no doubt , madam ; and now i wish you good morning .
i shall return to brocklehurst hall in the course of a week or two : my good friend , the archdeacon , will not permit me to leave him sooner . i shall send miss temple notice that she is to expect a new girl , so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her .
good-bye . "
" good-bye , mr. brocklehurst ; remember me to mrs. and miss brocklehurst , and to augusta and theodore , and master broughton brocklehurst . "
" i will , madam .
little girl , here is a book entitled the ' child 's guide , ' read it with prayer , especially that part containing ' an account of the awfully sudden death of martha g--- , a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit . ' "
with these words mr. brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .
mrs. reed and i were left alone : some minutes passed in silence ; she was sewing , i was watching her .
mrs. reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty ; she was a woman of robust frame , square-shouldered and strong-limbed , not tall , and , though stout , not obese : she had a somewhat large face , the under jaw being much developed and very solid ; her brow was low , her chin large and prominent , mouth and nose sufficiently regular ; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth ; her skin was dark and opaque , her hair nearly flaxen ; her constitution was sound as a bell--illness never came near her ; she was an exact , clever manager ; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control ; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn ; she dressed well , and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire .
sitting on a low stool , a few yards from her arm-chair , i examined her figure ; i perused her features .
in my hand i held the tract containing the sudden death of the liar , to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning .
what had just passed ; what mrs. reed had said concerning me to mr. brocklehurst ; the whole tenor of their conversation , was recent , raw , and stinging in my mind ; i had felt every word as acutely as i had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .
mrs. reed looked up from her work ; her eye settled on mine , her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements .
" go out of the room ; return to the nursery , " was her mandate .
my look or something else must have struck her as offensive , for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation .
i got up , i went to the door ; i came back again ; i walked to the window , across the room , then close up to her .
_ speak _ i must : i had been trodden on severely , and _ must _ turn : but how ?
what strength had i to dart retaliation at my antagonist ?
i gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
" i am not deceitful : if i were , i should say i loved you ; but i declare i do not love you : i dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except john reed ; and this book about the liar , you may give to your girl , georgiana , for it is she who tells lies , and not i. "
mrs. reed 's hands still lay on her work inactive : her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine .
" what more have you to say ? " she asked , rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child .
that eye of hers , that voice stirred every antipathy i had .
shaking from head to foot , thrilled with ungovernable excitement , i continued--
" i am glad you are no relation of mine : i will never call you aunt again as long as i live . i will never come to see you when i am grown up ; and if any one asks me how i liked you , and how you treated me , i will say the very thought of you makes me sick , and that you treated me with miserable cruelty . "
" how dare you affirm that , jane eyre ? "
" how dare i , mrs. reed ? how dare i ?
because it is the _ truth _ .
you think i have no feelings , and that i can do without one bit of love or kindness ; but i cannot live so : and you have no pity . i shall remember how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the red-room , and locked me up there , to my dying day ; though i was in agony ; though i cried out , while suffocating with distress ,
'have mercy ! have mercy , aunt reed ! '
and that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing .
i will tell anybody who asks me questions , this exact tale .
people think you a good woman , but you are bad , hard-hearted . _ you _ are deceitful ! "
ere i had finished this reply , my soul began to expand , to exult , with the strangest sense of freedom , of triumph , i ever felt .
it seemed as if an invisible bond had burst , and that i had struggled out into unhoped- for liberty .
not without cause was this sentiment : mrs. reed looked frightened ; her work had slipped from her knee ; she was lifting up her hands , rocking herself to and fro , and even twisting her face as if she would cry .
" jane , you are under a mistake : what is the matter with you ?
why do you tremble so violently ? would you like to drink some water ? "
" no , mrs. reed . "
" is there anything else you wish for , jane ?
i assure you , i desire to be your friend . "
" not you . you told mr. brocklehurst i had a bad character , a deceitful disposition ; and i 'll let everybody at lowood know what you are , and what you have done . "
" jane , you don 't understand these things : children must be corrected for their faults . "
" deceit is not my fault ! " i cried out in a savage , high voice .
" but you are passionate , jane , that you must allow : and now return to the nursery--there 's a dear--and lie down a little . "
" i am not your dear ; i cannot lie down : send me to school soon , mrs. reed , for i hate to live here . "
" i will indeed send her to school soon , " murmured mrs. reed _ sotto voce _ ; and gathering up her work , she abruptly quitted the apartment .
i was left there alone--winner of the field . it was the hardest battle i had fought , and the first victory i had gained : i stood awhile on the rug , where mr. brocklehurst had stood , and i enjoyed my conqueror 's solitude .
first , i smiled to myself and felt elate ; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses . a child cannot quarrel with its elders , as i had done ; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play , as i had given mine , without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction .
a ridge of lighted heath , alive , glancing , devouring , would have been a meet emblem of my mind when i accused and menaced mrs. reed : the same ridge , black and blasted after the flames are dead , would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition , when half-an-hour 's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct , and the dreariness of my hated and hating position .
something of vengeance i had tasted for the first time ; as aromatic wine it seemed , on swallowing , warm and racy : its after-flavour , metallic and corroding , gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned .
willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs. reed 's pardon ; but i knew , partly from experience and partly from instinct , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .
i would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking ; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation .
i took a book--some arabian tales ; i sat down and endeavoured to read . i could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page i had usually found fascinating .
i opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room : the shrubbery was quite still : the black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .
i covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock , and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated ; but i found no pleasure in the silent trees , the falling fir-cones , the congealed relics of autumn , russet leaves , swept by past winds in heaps , and now stiffened together . i leaned against a gate , and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding , where the short grass was nipped and blanched .
it was a very grey day ; a most opaque sky , " onding on snaw , " canopied all ; thence flakes felt it intervals , which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting .
i stood , a wretched child enough , whispering to myself over and over again , " what shall i do ? --what shall i do ? "
all at once i heard a clear voice call , " miss jane ! where are you ? come to lunch ! "
it was bessie , i knew well enough ; but i did not stir ; her light step came tripping down the path .
" you naughty little thing ! " she said . " why don 't you come when you are called ? "
bessie 's presence , compared with the thoughts over which i had been brooding , seemed cheerful ; even though , as usual , she was somewhat cross .
the fact is , after my conflict with and victory over mrs. reed , i was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid 's transitory anger ; and i _ was _ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart .
i just put my two arms round her and said , " come , bessie ! don 't scold . "
the action was more frank and fearless than any i was habituated to indulge in : somehow it pleased her .
" you are a strange child , miss jane , " she said , as she looked down at me ; " a little roving , solitary thing : and you are going to school , i suppose ? "
i nodded .
" and won 't you be sorry to leave poor bessie ? "
" what does bessie care for me ? she is always scolding me . "
" because you 're such a queer , frightened , shy little thing .
you should be bolder . "
" what ! to get more knocks ? "
" nonsense !
but you are rather put upon , that 's certain . my mother said , when she came to see me last week , that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.--now , come in , and i 've some good news for you . "
" i don 't think you have , bessie . "
" child ! what do you mean ?
what sorrowful eyes you fix on me !
well , but missis and the young ladies and master john are going out to tea this afternoon , and you shall have tea with me . i 'll ask cook to bake you a little cake , and then you shall help me to look over your drawers ; for i am soon to pack your trunk .
missis intends you to leave gateshead in a day or two , and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you . "
" bessie , you must promise not to scold me any more till i go . "
" well , i will ; but mind you are a very good girl , and don 't be afraid of me .
don 't start when i chance to speak rather sharply ; it 's so provoking . "
" i don 't think i shall ever be afraid of you again , bessie , because i have got used to you , and i shall soon have another set of people to dread . "
" if you dread them they 'll dislike you . "
" as you do , bessie ? "
" i don 't dislike you , miss ; i believe i am fonder of you than of all the others . "
" you don 't show it . "
" you little sharp thing ! you 've got quite a new way of talking .
what makes you so venturesome and hardy ? "
" why , i shall soon be away from you , and besides " --i was going to say something about what had passed between me and mrs. reed , but on second thoughts i considered it better to remain silent on that head .
" and so you 're glad to leave me ? "
" not at all , bessie ; indeed , just now i 'm rather sorry . "
" just now ! and rather ! how coolly my little lady says it !
i dare say now if i were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn 't give it me : you 'd say you 'd _ rather _ not . "
" i 'll kiss you and welcome : bend your head down . "
bessie stooped ; we mutually embraced , and i followed her into the house quite comforted .
that afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony ; and in the evening bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories , and sang me some of her sweetest songs .
even for me life had its gleams of sunshine .
chapter v
five o 'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of january , when bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed .
i had risen half-an-hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .
i was to leave gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m .
bessie was the only person yet risen ; she had lit a fire in the nursery , where she now proceeded to make my breakfast .
few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey ; nor could i. bessie , having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me , wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag ; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet , and wrapping herself in a shawl , she and i left the nursery .
as we passed mrs. reed 's bedroom , she said , " will you go in and bid missis good- bye ? "
" no , bessie : she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper , and said i need not disturb her in the morning , or my cousins either ; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend , and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly . "
" what did you say , miss ? "
" nothing : i covered my face with the bedclothes , and turned from her to the wall . "
" that was wrong , miss jane . "
" it was quite right , bessie .
your missis has not been my friend : she has been my foe . "
" o miss jane ! don 't say so ! "
" good-bye to gateshead ! " cried i , as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door .
the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .
there was a light in the porter 's lodge : when we reached it , we found the porter 's wife just kindling her fire : my trunk , which had been carried down the evening before , stood corded at the door .
it wanted but a few minutes of six , and shortly after that hour had struck , the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach ; i went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom .
" is she going by herself ? " asked the porter 's wife .
" yes . "
" and how far is it ? "
" fifty miles . "
" what a long way ! i wonder mrs. reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone . "
the coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guard and coachman loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted up ; i was taken from bessie 's neck , to which i clung with kisses .
" be sure and take good care of her , " cried she to the guard , as he lifted me into the inside .
" ay , ay ! " was the answer : the door was slapped to , a voice exclaimed " all right , " and on we drove .
thus was i severed from bessie and gateshead ; thus whirled away to unknown , and , as i then deemed , remote and mysterious regions .
i remember but little of the journey ; i only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length , and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road .
we passed through several towns , and in one , a very large one , the coach stopped ; the horses were taken out , and the passengers alighted to dine .
i was carried into an inn , where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but , as i had no appetite , he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end , a chandelier pendent from the ceiling , and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments .
here i walked about for a long time , feeling very strange , and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me ; for i believed in kidnappers , their exploits having frequently figured in bessie 's fireside chronicles .
at last the guard returned ; once more i was stowed away in the coach , my protector mounted his own seat , sounded his hollow horn , and away we rattled over the " stony street " of l- .
the afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty : as it waned into dusk , i began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from gateshead : we ceased to pass through towns ; the country changed ; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon : as twilight deepened , we descended a valley , dark with wood , and long after night had overclouded the prospect , i heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees .
lulled by the sound , i at last dropped asleep ; i had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me ; the coach-door was open , and a person like a servant was standing at it : i saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps .
" is there a little girl called jane eyre here ? " she asked .
i answered " yes , " and was then lifted out ; my trunk was handed down , and the coach instantly drove away .
i was stiff with long sitting , and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach : gathering my faculties , i looked about me .
rain , wind , and darkness filled the air ; nevertheless , i dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it ; through this door i passed with my new guide : she shut and locked it behind her .
there was now visible a house or houses--for the building spread far--with many windows , and lights burning in some ; we went up a broad pebbly path , splashing wet , and were admitted at a door ; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire , where she left me alone .
i stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze , then i looked round ; there was no candle , but the uncertain light from the hearth showed , by intervals , papered walls , carpet , curtains , shining mahogany furniture : it was a parlour , not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at gateshead , but comfortable enough .
i was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall , when the door opened , and an individual carrying a light entered ; another followed close behind .
the first was a tall lady with dark hair , dark eyes , and a pale and large forehead ; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl , her countenance was grave , her bearing erect .
" the child is very young to be sent alone , " said she , putting her candle down on the table .
she considered me attentively for a minute or two , then further added--
" she had better be put to bed soon ; she looks tired : are you tired ? " she asked , placing her hand on my shoulder .
" a little , ma 'am . "
" and hungry too , no doubt : let her have some supper before she goes to bed , miss miller .
is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school , my little girl ? "
i explained to her that i had no parents . she inquired how long they had been dead : then how old i was , what was my name , whether i could read , write , and sew a little : then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger , and saying , " she hoped i should be a good child , " dismissed me along with miss miller .
the lady i had left might be about twenty-nine ; the one who went with me appeared some years younger : the first impressed me by her voice , look , and air .
miss miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what i afterwards found she really was , an under-teacher .
led by her , i passed from compartment to compartment , from passage to passage , of a large and irregular building ; till , emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed , we came upon the hum of many voices , and presently entered a wide , long room , with great deal tables , two at each end , on each of which burnt a pair of candles , and seated all round on benches , a congregation of girls of every age , from nine or ten to twenty .
seen by the dim light of the dips , their number to me appeared countless , though not in reality exceeding eighty ; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion , and long holland pinafores .
it was the hour of study ; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow 's task , and the hum i had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions .
miss miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door , then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out--
" monitors , collect the lesson-books and put them away ! "
four tall girls arose from different tables , and going round , gathered the books and removed them .
miss miller again gave the word of command--
" monitors , fetch the supper-trays ! "
the tall girls went out and returned presently , each bearing a tray , with portions of something , i knew not what , arranged thereon , and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray .
the portions were handed round ; those who liked took a draught of the water , the mug being common to all .
when it came to my turn , i drank , for i was thirsty , but did not touch the food , excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating : i now saw , however , that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments .
the meal over , prayers were read by miss miller , and the classes filed off , two and two , upstairs .
overpowered by this time with weariness , i scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was , except that , like the schoolroom , i saw it was very long .
to-night i was to be miss miller 's bed-fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down i glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep .
the night passed rapidly . i was too tired even to dream ; i only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts , and the rain fall in torrents , and to be sensible that miss miller had taken her place by my side .
when i again unclosed my eyes , a loud bell was ringing ; the girls were up and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn , and a rushlight or two burned in the room .
i too rose reluctantly ; it was bitter cold , and i dressed as well as i could for shivering , and washed when there was a basin at liberty , which did not occur soon , as there was but one basin to six girls , on the stands down the middle of the room .
again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by miss miller ; afterwards she called out--
" form classes ! "
a great tumult succeeded for some minutes , during which miss miller repeatedly exclaimed , " silence ! " and " order ! "
when it subsided , i saw them all drawn up in four semicircles , before four chairs , placed at the four tables ; all held books in their hands , and a great book , like a bible , lay on each table , before the vacant seat .
a pause of some seconds succeeded , filled up by the low , vague hum of numbers ; miss miller walked from class to class , hushing this indefinite sound .
a distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered the room , each walked to a table and took her seat .
miss miller assumed the fourth vacant chair , which was that nearest the door , and around which the smallest of the children were assembled : to this inferior class i was called , and placed at the bottom of it .
business now began , the day 's collect was repeated , then certain texts of scripture were said , and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the bible , which lasted an hour .
by the time that exercise was terminated , day had fully dawned .
the indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast : how glad i was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat !
i was now nearly sick from inanition , having taken so little the day before .
the refectory was a great , low-ceiled , gloomy room ; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot , which , however , to my dismay , sent forth an odour far from inviting .
i saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it ; from the van of the procession , the tall girls of the first class , rose the whispered words--
" disgusting ! the porridge is burnt again ! "
" silence ! " ejaculated a voice ; not that of miss miller , but one of the upper teachers , a little and dark personage , smartly dressed , but of somewhat morose aspect , who installed herself at the top of one table , while a more buxom lady presided at the other .
i looked in vain for her i had first seen the night before ; she was not visible : miss miller occupied the foot of the table where i sat , and a strange , foreign-looking , elderly lady , the french teacher , as i afterwards found , took the corresponding seat at the other board .
a long grace was said and a hymn sung ; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers , and the meal began .
ravenous , and now very faint , i devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste ; but the first edge of hunger blunted , i perceived i had got in hand a nauseous mess ; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes ; famine itself soon sickens over it .
the spoons were moved slowly : i saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it ; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished .
breakfast was over , and none had breakfasted . thanks being returned for what we had not got , and a second hymn chanted , the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom .
i was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , i saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered--
" abominable stuff ! how shameful ! "
a quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began , during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely , and they used their privilege .
the whole conversation ran on the breakfast , which one and all abused roundly .
poor things ! it was the sole consolation they had .
miss miller was now the only teacher in the room : a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures .
i heard the name of mr. brocklehurst pronounced by some lips ; at which miss miller shook her head disapprovingly ; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath ; doubtless she shared in it .
a clock in the schoolroom struck nine ; miss miller left her circle , and standing in the middle of the room , cried--
" silence ! to your seats ! "
discipline prevailed : in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order , and comparative silence quelled the babel clamour of tongues .
the upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts : but still , all seemed to wait .
ranged on benches down the sides of the room , the eighty girls sat motionless and erect ; a quaint assemblage they appeared , all with plain locks combed from their faces , not a curl visible ; in brown dresses , made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat , with little pockets of holland ( shaped something like a highlander 's purse ) tied in front of their frocks , and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag : all , too , wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes , fastened with brass buckles .
above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls , or rather young women ; it suited them ill , and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest .
i was still looking at them , and also at intervals examining the teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me ; for the stout one was a little coarse , the dark one not a little fierce , the foreigner harsh and grotesque , and miss miller , poor thing ! looked purple , weather-beaten , and over-worked--when , as my eye wandered from face to face , the whole school rose simultaneously , as if moved by a common spring .
what was the matter ? i had heard no order given : i was puzzled .
ere i had gathered my wits , the classes were again seated : but as all eyes were now turned to one point , mine followed the general direction , and encountered the personage who had received me last night .
she stood at the bottom of the long room , on the hearth ; for there was a fire at each end ; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely .
miss miller approaching , seemed to ask her a question , and having received her answer , went back to her place , and said aloud--
" monitor of the first class , fetch the globes ! "
while the direction was being executed , the lady consulted moved slowly up the room . i suppose i have a considerable organ of veneration , for i retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps .
seen now , in broad daylight , she looked tall , fair , and shapely ; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids , and a fine pencilling of long lashes round , relieved the whiteness of her large front ; on each of her temples her hair , of a very dark brown , was clustered in round curls , according to the fashion of those times , when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue ; her dress , also in the mode of the day , was of purple cloth , relieved by a sort of spanish trimming of black velvet ; a gold watch ( watches were not so common then as now ) shone at her girdle .
let the reader add , to complete the picture , refined features ; a complexion , if pale , clear ; and a stately air and carriage , and he will have , at least , as clearly as words can give it , a correct idea of the exterior of miss temple--maria temple , as i afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church .
the superintendent of lowood ( for such was this lady ) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables , summoned the first class round her , and commenced giving a lesson on geography ; the lower classes were called by the teachers : repetitions in history , grammar , & c . , went on for an hour ; writing and arithmetic succeeded , and music lessons were given by miss temple to some of the elder girls .
the duration of each lesson was measured by the clock , which at last struck twelve .
the superintendent rose--
" i have a word to address to the pupils , " said she .
the tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth , but it sank at her voice .
she went on-- " you had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat ; you must be hungry : --i have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all . "
the teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise .
" it is to be done on my responsibility , " she added , in an explanatory tone to them , and immediately afterwards left the room .
the bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed , to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school .
the order was now given " to the garden ! " each put on a coarse straw bonnet , with strings of coloured calico , and a cloak of grey frieze . i was similarly equipped , and , following the stream , i made my way into the open air .
the garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .
when full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty ; but now , at the latter end of january , all was wintry blight and brown decay .
i shuddered as i stood and looked round me : it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise ; not positively rainy , but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog ; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday .
the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .
as yet i had spoken to no one , nor did anybody seem to take notice of me ; i stood lonely enough : but to that feeling of isolation i was accustomed ; it did not oppress me much .
i leant against a pillar of the verandah , drew my grey mantle close about me , and , trying to forget the cold which nipped me without , and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within , delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking .
my reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record : i hardly yet knew where i was ; gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance ; the present was vague and strange , and of the future i could form no conjecture .
i looked round the convent-like garden , and then up at the house--a large building , half of which seemed grey and old , the other half quite new .
the new part , containing the schoolroom and dormitory , was lit by mullioned and latticed windows , which gave it a church-like aspect ; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription : --
" lowood institution.--this portion was rebuilt a.d. --- , by naomi brocklehurst , of brocklehurst hall , in this county . "
" let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your father which is in heaven . " --st .
matt. v. 16 .
i read these words over and over again : i felt that an explanation belonged to them , and was unable fully to penetrate their import .
i was still pondering the signification of " institution , " and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of scripture , when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head .
i saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near ; she was bent over a book , on the perusal of which she seemed intent : from where i stood i could see the title--it was " rasselas ; " a name that struck me as strange , and consequently attractive .
in turning a leaf she happened to look up , and i said to her directly--
" is your book interesting ? "
i had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day .
" i like it , " she answered , after a pause of a second or two , during which she examined me .
" what is it about ? " i continued .
i hardly know where i found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger ; the step was contrary to my nature and habits : but i think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere ; for i too liked reading , though of a frivolous and childish kind ; i could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial .
" you may look at it , " replied the girl , offering me the book .
i did so ; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title : " rasselas " looked dull to my trifling taste ; i saw nothing about fairies , nothing about genii ; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages .
i returned it to her ; she received it quietly , and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood : again i ventured to disturb her--
" can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means ?
what is lowood institution ? "
" this house where you are come to live . "
" and why do they call it institution ?
is it in any way different from other schools ? "
" it is partly a charity-school : you and i , and all the rest of us , are charity-children .
i suppose you are an orphan : are not either your father or your mother dead ? "
" both died before i can remember . "
" well , all the girls here have lost either one or both parents , and this is called an institution for educating orphans . "
" do we pay no money ? do they keep us for nothing ? "
" we pay , or our friends pay , fifteen pounds a year for each . "
" then why do they call us charity-children ? "
" because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching , and the deficiency is supplied by subscription . "
" who subscribes ? "
" different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in london . "
" who was naomi brocklehurst ? "
" the lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records , and whose son overlooks and directs everything here . "
" why ? "
" because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment . "
" then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch , and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ? "
" to miss temple ? oh , no !
i wish it did : she has to answer to mr. brocklehurst for all she does .
mr. brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes . "
" does he live here ? "
" no--two miles off , at a large hall . "
" is he a good man ? "
" he is a clergyman , and is said to do a great deal of good . "
" did you say that tall lady was called miss temple ? "
" yes . "
" and what are the other teachers called ? "
" the one with red cheeks is called miss smith ; she attends to the work , and cuts out--for we make our own clothes , our frocks , and pelisses , and everything ; the little one with black hair is miss scatcherd ; she teaches history and grammar , and hears the second class repetitions ; and the one who wears a shawl , and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband , is madame pierrot : she comes from lisle , in france , and teaches french . "
" do you like the teachers ? "
" well enough . "
" do you like the little black one , and the madame --- ? --i cannot pronounce her name as you do . "
" miss scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her ; madame pierrot is not a bad sort of person . "
" but miss temple is the best--isn 't she ? "
" miss temple is very good and very clever ; she is above the rest , because she knows far more than they do . "
" have you been long here ? "
" two years . "
" are you an orphan ? "
" my mother is dead . "
" are you happy here ? "
" you ask rather too many questions . i have given you answers enough for the present : now i want to read . "
but at that moment the summons sounded for dinner ; all re-entered the house .
the odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast : the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels , whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat .
i found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat , mixed and cooked together .
of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil . i ate what i could , and wondered within myself whether every day 's fare would be like this .
after dinner , we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom : lessons recommenced , and were continued till five o 'clock .
the only marked event of the afternoon was , that i saw the girl with whom i had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by miss scatcherd from a history class , and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom .
the punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious , especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards . i expected she would show signs of great distress and shame ; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed : composed , though grave , she stood , the central mark of all eyes .
" how can she bear it so quietly--so firmly ? " i asked of myself . " were i in her place , it seems to me i should wish the earth to open and swallow me up .
she looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation : of something not round her nor before her .
i have heard of day-dreams--is she in a day-dream now ?
her eyes are fixed on the floor , but i am sure they do not see it--her sight seems turned in , gone down into her heart : she is looking at what she can remember , i believe ; not at what is really present .
i wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty . "
soon after five p.m. we had another meal , consisting of a small mug of coffee , and half-a-slice of brown bread . i devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish ; but i should have been glad of as much more--i was still hungry .
half-an-hour 's recreation succeeded , then study ; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake , prayers , and bed .
such was my first day at lowood .
chapter vi
the next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen .
a change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice .
before the long hour and a half of prayers and bible-reading was over , i felt ready to perish with cold .
breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was not burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small .
how small my portion seemed ! i wished it had been doubled .
in the course of the day i was enrolled a member of the fourth class , and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me : hitherto , i had only been a spectator of the proceedings at lowood ; i was now to become an actor therein .
at first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and i was glad when , about three o 'clock in the afternoon , miss smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c . , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .
at that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round miss scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of miss scatcherd on the performance .
it was english history : among the readers i observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at the top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom .
even in that obscure position , miss scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : --
" burns " ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , " burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . "
" burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in . "
" burns , i insist on your holding your head up ; i will not have you before me in that attitude , " & c . & c .
a chapter having been read through twice , the books were closed and the girls examined .
the lesson had comprised part of the reign of charles i. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point .
i kept expecting that miss scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out--
" you dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning ! "
burns made no answer : i wondered at her silence .
" why , " thought i , " does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? "
my attention was now called off by miss smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether i had ever been at school before , whether i could mark , stitch , knit , & c . ; till she dismissed me , i could not pursue my observations on miss scatcherd 's movements .
when i returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which i did not catch the import ; but burns immediately left the class , and going into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end .
this ominous tool she presented to miss scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs .
not a tear rose to burns ' eye ; and , while i paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression .
" hardened girl ! " exclaimed miss scatcherd ; " nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away . "
burns obeyed : i looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek .
the play-hour in the evening i thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o 'clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty .
on the evening of the day on which i had seen miss scatcherd flog her pupil , burns , i wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when i passed the windows , i now and then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , i could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside .
probably , if i had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when i should most keenly have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace ! as it was , i derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , i wished the wind to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour .
jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , i made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , i found burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers .
" is it still ' rasselas ' ? " i asked , coming behind her .
" yes , " she said , " and i have just finished it . "
and in five minutes more she shut it up . i was glad of this .
" now , " thought i , " i can perhaps get her to talk . "
i sat down by her on the floor .
" what is your name besides burns ? "
" helen . "
" do you come a long way from here ? "
" i come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of scotland . "
" will you ever go back ? "
" i hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future . "
" you must wish to leave lowood ? "
" no ! why should i ?
i was sent to lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until i have attained that object . "
" but that teacher , miss scatcherd , is so cruel to you ? " " cruel ?
not at all ! she is severe : she dislikes my faults . "
" and if i were in your place i should dislike her ; i should resist her . if she struck me with that rod , i should get it from her hand ; i should break it under her nose . "
" probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , mr. brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations .
it is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the bible bids us return good for evil . "
" but then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : i am far younger than you , and i could not bear it . "
" yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you _ cannot bear _ what it is your fate to be required to bear . "
i heard her with wonder : i could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and still less could i understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser .
still i felt that helen burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes . i suspected she might be right and i wrong ; but i would not ponder the matter deeply ; like felix , i put it off to a more convenient season .
" you say you have faults , helen : what are they ?
to me you seem very good . "
" then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : i am , as miss scatcherd said , slatternly ; i seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; i am careless ; i forget rules ; i read when i should learn my lessons ; i have no method ; and sometimes i say , like you , i cannot _ bear _ to be subjected to systematic arrangements .
this is all very provoking to miss scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular . "
" and cross and cruel , " i added ; but helen burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence .
" is miss temple as severe to you as miss scatcherd ? "
at the utterance of miss temple 's name , a soft smile flitted over her grave face .
" miss temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if i do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally . one strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though i value it most highly , cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight . "
" that is curious , " said i , " it is so easy to be careful . "
" for _ you _ i have no doubt it is .
i observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while miss miller explained the lesson and questioned you .
now , mine continually rove away ; when i should be listening to miss scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often i lose the very sound of her voice ; i fall into a sort of dream .
sometimes i think i am in northumberland , and that the noises i hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through deepden , near our house ; --then , when it comes to my turn to reply , i have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , i have no answer ready . "
" yet how well you replied this afternoon . "
" it was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me .
this afternoon , instead of dreaming of deepden , i was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as charles the first sometimes did ; and i thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown .
if he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending !
still , i like charles--i respect him--i pity him , poor murdered king ! yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed .
how dared they kill him ! "
helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten i could not very well understand her--that i was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed . i recalled her to my level .
" and when miss temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ? "
" no , certainly , not often ; because miss temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what i wished to gain . "
" well , then , with miss temple you are good ? "
" yes , in a passive way : i make no effort ; i follow as inclination guides me . there is no merit in such goodness . "
" a great deal : you are good to those who are good to you . it is all i ever desire to be .
if people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse .
when we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ; i am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again . "
" you will change your mind , i hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl . "
" but i feel this , helen ; i must dislike those who , whatever i do to please them , persist in disliking me ; i must resist those who punish me unjustly . it is as natural as that i should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when i feel it is deserved . "
" heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but christians and civilised nations disown it . "
" how ?
i don 't understand . "
" it is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury . "
" what then ? "
" read the new testament , and observe what christ says , and how he acts ; make his word your rule , and his conduct your example . "
" what does he say ? "
" love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . "
" then i should love mrs. reed , which i cannot do ; i should bless her son john , which is impossible . "
in her turn , helen burns asked me to explain , and i proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments .
bitter and truculent when excited , i spoke as i felt , without reserve or softening .
helen heard me patiently to the end : i expected she would then make a remark , but she said nothing .
" well , " i asked impatiently , " is not mrs. reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ? "
" she has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as miss scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you !
what a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart !
no ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings .
would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ?
life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs .
we are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , i trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , --the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !
surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? no ; i cannot believe that : i hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which i seldom mention ; but in which i delight , and to which i cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes eternity a rest--a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss .
besides , with this creed , i can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; i can so sincerely forgive the first while i abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : i live in calm , looking to the end . "
helen 's head , always drooping , sank a little lower as she finished this sentence . i saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts .
she was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great rough girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong cumberland accent--
" helen burns , if you don 't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , i 'll tell miss scatcherd to come and look at it ! "
helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay .
chapter vii
my first quarter at lowood seemed an age ; and not the golden age either ; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks .
the fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot ; though these were no trifles .
during january , february , and part of march , the deep snows , and , after their melting , the almost impassable roads , prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls , except to go to church ; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air .
our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold : we had no boots , the snow got into our shoes and melted there : our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains , as were our feet : i remember well the distracting irritation i endured from this cause every evening , when my feet inflamed ; and the torture of thrusting the swelled , raw , and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning .
then the scanty supply of food was distressing : with the keen appetites of growing children , we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid .
from this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse , which pressed hardly on the younger pupils : whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity , they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion .
many a time i have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time ; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee , i have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears , forced from me by the exigency of hunger .
sundays were dreary days in that wintry season .
we had to walk two miles to brocklebridge church , where our patron officiated .
we set out cold , we arrived at church colder : during the morning service we became almost paralysed .
it was too far to return to dinner , and an allowance of cold meat and bread , in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals , was served round between the services .
at the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road , where the bitter winter wind , blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north , almost flayed the skin from our faces .
i can remember miss temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line , her plaid cloak , which the frosty wind fluttered , gathered close about her , and encouraging us , by precept and example , to keep up our spirits , and march forward , as she said , " like stalwart soldiers . "
the other teachers , poor things , were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others .
how we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back !
but , to the little ones at least , this was denied : each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls , and behind them the younger children crouched in groups , wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores .
a little solace came at tea-time , in the shape of a double ration of bread--a whole , instead of a half , slice--with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter : it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from sabbath to sabbath .
i generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself ; but the remainder i was invariably obliged to part with .
the sunday evening was spent in repeating , by heart , the church catechism , and the fifth , sixth , and seventh chapters of st. matthew ; and in listening to a long sermon , read by miss miller , whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness .
a frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls , who , overpowered with sleep , would fall down , if not out of the third loft , yet off the fourth form , and be taken up half dead .
the remedy was , to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom , and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished . sometimes their feet failed them , and they sank together in a heap ; they were then propped up with the monitors ' high stools .
i have not yet alluded to the visits of mr. brocklehurst ; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival ; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon : his absence was a relief to me .
i need not say that i had my own reasons for dreading his coming : but come he did at last .
one afternoon ( i had then been three weeks at lowood ) , as i was sitting with a slate in my hand , puzzling over a sum in long division , my eyes , raised in abstraction to the window , caught sight of a figure just passing : i recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline ; and when , two minutes after , all the school , teachers included , rose _ en masse _ , it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted . a long stride measured the schoolroom , and presently beside miss temple , who herself had risen , stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of gateshead .
i now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture . yes , i was right : it was mr. brocklehurst , buttoned up in a surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .
i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition ; too well i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs. reed about my disposition , & c . ; the promise pledged by mr. brocklehurst to apprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature .
all along i had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise , --i had been looking out daily for the " coming man , " whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever : now there he was .
he stood at miss temple 's side ; he was speaking low in her ear : i did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy ; and i watched her eye with painful anxiety , expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt .
i listened too ; and as i happened to be seated quite at the top of the room , i caught most of what he said : its import relieved me from immediate apprehension .
" i suppose , miss temple , the thread i bought at lowton will do ; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises , and i sorted the needles to match .
you may tell miss smith that i forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles , but she shall have some papers sent in next week ; and she is not , on any account , to give out more than one at a time to each pupil : if they have more , they are apt to be careless and lose them .
and , o ma 'am ! i wish the woollen stockings were better looked to ! --when i was here last , i went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line ; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from the size of the holes in them i was sure they had not been well mended from time to time . "
he paused .
" your directions shall be attended to , sir , " said miss temple .
" and , ma 'am , " he continued , " the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week : it is too much ; the rules limit them to one . "
" i think i can explain that circumstance , sir .
agnes and catherine johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at lowton last thursday , and i gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion . "
mr. brocklehurst nodded .
" well , for once it may pass ; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often .
and there is another thing which surprised me ; i find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a lunch , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight . how is this ?
i looked over the regulations , and i find no such meal as lunch mentioned .
who introduced this innovation ? and by what authority ? "
" i must be responsible for the circumstance , sir , " replied miss temple : " the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it ; and i dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time . "
" madam , allow me an instant .
you are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self-denying .
should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur , such as the spoiling of a meal , the under or the over dressing of a dish , the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost , thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution ; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils , by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation .
a brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed , wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive christians ; to the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed lord himself , calling upon his disciples to take up their cross and follow him ; to his warnings that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god ; to his divine consolations , " if ye suffer hunger or thirst for my sake , happy are ye . "
oh , madam , when you put bread and cheese , instead of burnt porridge , into these children 's mouths , you may indeed feed their vile bodies , but you little think how you starve their immortal souls ! "
mr. brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings .
miss temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her ; but she now gazed straight before her , and her face , naturally pale as marble , appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material ; especially her mouth , closed as if it would have required a sculptor 's chisel to open it , and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity .
meantime , mr. brocklehurst , standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back , majestically surveyed the whole school .
suddenly his eye gave a blink , as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil ; turning , he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
" miss temple , miss temple , what-- _ what _ is that girl with curled hair ? red hair , ma 'am , curled--curled all over ? "
and extending his cane he pointed to the awful object , his hand shaking as he did so .
" it is julia severn , " replied miss temple , very quietly .
" julia severn , ma 'am ! and why has she , or any other , curled hair ?
why , in defiance of every precept and principle of this house , does she conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical , charitable establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls ? "
" julia 's hair curls naturally , " returned miss temple , still more quietly .
" naturally ! yes , but we are not to conform to nature ; i wish these girls to be the children of grace : and why that abundance ?
i have again and again intimated that i desire the hair to be arranged closely , modestly , plainly .
miss temple , that girl 's hair must be cut off entirely ; i will send a barber to-morrow : and i see others who have far too much of the excrescence--that tall girl , tell her to turn round .
tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall . "
miss temple passed her handkerchief over her lips , as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them ; she gave the order , however , and when the first class could take in what was required of them , they obeyed .
leaning a little back on my bench , i could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre : it was a pity mr. brocklehurst could not see them too ; he would perhaps have felt that , whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter , the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined .
he scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes , then pronounced sentence .
these words fell like the knell of doom--
" all those top-knots must be cut off . "
miss temple seemed to remonstrate .
" madam , " he pursued , " i have a master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety , not with braided hair and costly apparel ; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven ; these , i repeat , must be cut off ; think of the time wasted , of-- " mr. brocklehurst was here interrupted : three other visitors , ladies , now entered the room .
they ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress , for they were splendidly attired in velvet , silk , and furs .
the two younger of the trio ( fine girls of sixteen and seventeen ) had grey beaver hats , then in fashion , shaded with ostrich plumes , and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses , elaborately curled ; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl , trimmed with ermine , and she wore a false front of french curls .
these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple , as mrs. and the misses brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .
it seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative , and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs , while he transacted business with the housekeeper , questioned the laundress , and lectured the superintendent .
they now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to miss smith , who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories : but i had no time to listen to what they said ; other matters called off and enchanted my attention .
hitherto , while gathering up the discourse of mr. brocklehurst and miss temple , i had not , at the same time , neglected precautions to secure my personal safety ; which i thought would be effected , if i could only elude observation .
to this end , i had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : i might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ; i knew it was all over now , and , as i stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , i rallied my forces for the worst .
it came .
" a careless girl ! " said mr. brocklehurst , and immediately after-- " it is the new pupil , i perceive . " and before i could draw breath , " i must not forget i have a word to say respecting her . " then aloud : how loud it seemed to me !
" let the child who broke her slate come forward ! "
of my own accord i could not have stirred ; i was paralysed : but the two great girls who sit on each side of me , set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge , and then miss temple gently assisted me to his very feet , and i caught her whispered counsel--
" don 't be afraid , jane , i saw it was an accident ; you shall not be punished . "
the kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger .
" another minute , and she will despise me for a hypocrite , " thought i ; and an impulse of fury against reed , brocklehurst , and co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction . i was no helen burns .
" fetch that stool , " said mr. brocklehurst , pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen : it was brought .
" place the child upon it . "
and i was placed there , by whom i don 't know : i was in no condition to note particulars ; i was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of mr. brocklehurst 's nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me .
mr. brocklehurst hemmed . " ladies , " said he , turning to his family , " miss temple , teachers , and children , you all see this girl ? "
of course they did ; for i felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin .
" you see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; god has graciously given her the shape that he has given to all of us ; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character .
who would think that the evil one had already found a servant and agent in her ?
yet such , i grieve to say , is the case . "
a pause--in which i began to steady the palsy of my nerves , and to feel that the rubicon was passed ; and that the trial , no longer to be shirked , must be firmly sustained .
" my dear children , " pursued the black marble clergyman , with pathos , " this is a sad , a melancholy occasion ; for it becomes my duty to warn you , that this girl , who might be one of god 's own lambs , is a little castaway : not a member of the true flock , but evidently an interloper and an alien . you must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , avoid her company , exclude her from your sports , and shut her out from your converse .
teachers , you must watch her : keep your eyes on her movements , weigh well her words , scrutinise her actions , punish her body to save her soul : if , indeed , such salvation be possible , for ( my tongue falters while i tell it ) this girl , this child , the native of a christian land , worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to brahma and kneels before juggernaut--this girl is--a liar ! "
now came a pause of ten minutes , during which i , by this time in perfect possession of my wits , observed all the female brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics , while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro , and the two younger ones whispered , " how shocking ! "
mr. brocklehurst resumed . " this i learned from her benefactress ; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state , reared her as her own daughter , and whose kindness , whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad , so dreadful , that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones , fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has sent her here to be healed , even as the jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of bethesda ; and , teachers , superintendent , i beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her . "
with this sublime conclusion , mr. brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout , muttered something to his family , who rose , bowed to miss temple , and then all the great people sailed in state from the room .
turning at the door , my judge said--
" let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool , and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day . "
there was i , then , mounted aloft ; i , who had said i could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room , was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy .
what my sensations were no language can describe ; but just as they all rose , stifling my breath and constricting my throat , a girl came up and passed me : in passing , she lifted her eyes .
what a strange light inspired them ! what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! how the new feeling bore me up !
it was as if a martyr , a hero , had passed a slave or victim , and imparted strength in the transit .
i mastered the rising hysteria , lifted up my head , and took a firm stand on the stool .
helen burns asked some slight question about her work of miss smith , was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry , returned to her place , and smiled at me as she again went by .
what a smile !
i remember it now , and i know that it was the effluence of fine intellect , of true courage ; it lit up her marked lineaments , her thin face , her sunken grey eye , like a reflection from the aspect of an angel .
yet at that moment helen burns wore on her arm " the untidy badge ; " scarcely an hour ago i had heard her condemned by miss scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out .
chapter viii
ere the half-hour ended , five o 'clock struck ; school was dismissed , and all were gone into the refectory to tea .
i now ventured to descend : it was deep dusk ; i retired into a corner and sat down on the floor .
the spell by which i had been so far supported began to dissolve ; reaction took place , and soon , so overwhelming was the grief that seized me , i sank prostrate with my face to the ground .
now i wept : helen burns was not here ; nothing sustained me ; left to myself i abandoned myself , and my tears watered the boards .
i had meant to be so good , and to do so much at lowood : to make so many friends , to earn respect and win affection .
already i had made visible progress : that very morning i had reached the head of my class ; miss miller had praised me warmly ; miss temple had smiled approbation ; she had promised to teach me drawing , and to let me learn french , if i continued to make similar improvement two months longer : and then i was well received by my fellow-pupils ; treated as an equal by those of my own age , and not molested by any ; now , here i lay again crushed and trodden on ; and could i ever rise more ?
" never , " i thought ; and ardently i wished to die .
while sobbing out this wish in broken accents , some one approached : i started up--again helen burns was near me ; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long , vacant room ; she brought my coffee and bread .
" come , eat something , " she said ; but i put both away from me , feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition .
helen regarded me , probably with surprise : i could not now abate my agitation , though i tried hard ; i continued to weep aloud .
she sat down on the ground near me , embraced her knees with her arms , and rested her head upon them ; in that attitude she remained silent as an indian .
i was the first who spoke--
" helen , why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar ? "
" everybody , jane ?
why , there are only eighty people who have heard you called so , and the world contains hundreds of millions . "
" but what have i to do with millions ?
the eighty , i know , despise me . "
" jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you : many , i am sure , pity you much . "
" how can they pity me after what mr. brocklehurst has said ? "
" mr. brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great and admired man : he is little liked here ; he never took steps to make himself liked .
had he treated you as an especial favourite , you would have found enemies , declared or covert , all around you ; as it is , the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared .
teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two , but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts ; and if you persevere in doing well , these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression .
besides , jane " --she paused .
" well , helen ? " said i , putting my hand into hers : she chafed my fingers gently to warm them , and went on--
" if all the world hated you , and believed you wicked , while your own conscience approved you , and absolved you from guilt , you would not be without friends . "
" no ; i know i should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others don 't love me i would rather die than live--i cannot bear to be solitary and hated , helen .
look here ; to gain some real affection from you , or miss temple , or any other whom i truly love , i would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken , or to let a bull toss me , or to stand behind a kicking horse , and let it dash its hoof at my chest-- "
" hush , jane ! you think too much of the love of human beings ; you are too impulsive , too vehement ; the sovereign hand that created your frame , and put life into it , has provided you with other resources than your feeble self , or than creatures feeble as you .
besides this earth , and besides the race of men , there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits : that world is round us , for it is everywhere ; and those spirits watch us , for they are commissioned to guard us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame , if scorn smote us on all sides , and hatred crushed us , angels see our tortures , recognise our innocence ( if innocent we be : as i know you are of this charge which mr. brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from mrs. reed ; for i read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front ) , and god waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward .
why , then , should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress , when life is so soon over , and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory ? "
i was silent ; helen had calmed me ; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness .
i felt the impression of woe as she spoke , but i could not tell whence it came ; and when , having done speaking , she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough , i momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her .
resting my head on helen 's shoulder , i put my arms round her waist ; she drew me to her , and we reposed in silence . we had not sat long thus , when another person came in .
some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in through a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as miss temple .
" i came on purpose to find you , jane eyre , " said she ; " i want you in my room ; and as helen burns is with you , she may come too . "
we went ; following the superintendent 's guidance , we had to thread some intricate passages , and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment ; it contained a good fire , and looked cheerful .
miss temple told helen burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth , and herself taking another , she called me to her side .
" is it all over ? " she asked , looking down at my face . " have you cried your grief away ? "
" i am afraid i never shall do that . "
" why ? "
" because i have been wrongly accused ; and you , ma 'am , and everybody else , will now think me wicked . "
" we shall think you what you prove yourself to be , my child .
continue to act as a good girl , and you will satisfy us . "
" shall i , miss temple ? "
" you will , " said she , passing her arm round me . " and now tell me who is the lady whom mr. brocklehurst called your benefactress ? "
" mrs. reed , my uncle 's wife . my uncle is dead , and he left me to her care . "
" did she not , then , adopt you of her own accord ? "
" no , ma 'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle , as i have often heard the servants say , got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me . "
" well now , jane , you know , or at least i will tell you , that when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence .
you have been charged with falsehood ; defend yourself to me as well as you can . say whatever your memory suggests is true ; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing . "
i resolved , in the depth of my heart , that i would be most moderate--most correct ; and , having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what i had to say , i told her all the story of my sad childhood .
exhausted by emotion , my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme ; and mindful of helen 's warnings against the indulgence of resentment , i infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary . thus restrained and simplified , it sounded more credible : i felt as i went on that miss temple fully believed me .
in the course of the tale i had mentioned mr. lloyd as having come to see me after the fit : for i never forgot the , to me , frightful episode of the red-room : in detailing which , my excitement was sure , in some degree , to break bounds ; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when mrs. reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon , and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber .
i had finished : miss temple regarded me a few minutes in silence ; she then said--
" i know something of mr. lloyd ; i shall write to him ; if his reply agrees with your statement , you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation ; to me , jane , you are clear now . "
she kissed me , and still keeping me at her side ( where i was well contented to stand , for i derived a child 's pleasure from the contemplation of her face , her dress , her one or two ornaments , her white forehead , her clustered and shining curls , and beaming dark eyes ) , she proceeded to address helen burns .
" how are you to-night , helen ? have you coughed much to-day ? "
" not quite so much , i think , ma 'am . "
" and the pain in your chest ? "
" it is a little better . "
miss temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed it , i heard her sigh low .
she was pensive a few minutes , then rousing herself , she said cheerfully--
" but you two are my visitors to-night ; i must treat you as such . "
she rang her bell .
" barbara , " she said to the servant who answered it , " i have not yet had tea ; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies . "
and a tray was soon brought .
how pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright teapot look , placed on the little round table near the fire !
how fragrant was the steam of the beverage , and the scent of the toast ! of which , however , i , to my dismay ( for i was beginning to be hungry ) discerned only a very small portion : miss temple discerned it too .
" barbara , " said she , " can you not bring a little more bread and butter ? there is not enough for three . "
barbara went out : she returned soon--
" madam , mrs. harden says she has sent up the usual quantity . "
mrs. harden , be it observed , was the housekeeper : a woman after mr. brocklehurst 's own heart , made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron .
" oh , very well ! " returned miss temple ; " we must make it do , barbara , i suppose . "
and as the girl withdrew she added , smiling , " fortunately , i have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once . "
having invited helen and me to approach the table , and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast , she got up , unlocked a drawer , and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper , disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake .
" i meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , " said she , " but as there is so little toast , you must have it now , " and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand .
we feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia ; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us , as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied .
tea over and the tray removed , she again summoned us to the fire ; we sat one on each side of her , and now a conversation followed between her and helen , which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear .
miss temple had always something of serenity in her air , of state in her mien , of refined propriety in her language , which precluded deviation into the ardent , the excited , the eager : something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her , by a controlling sense of awe ; and such was my feeling now : but as to helen burns , i was struck with wonder .
the refreshing meal , the brilliant fire , the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress , or , perhaps , more than all these , something in her own unique mind , had roused her powers within her .
they woke , they kindled : first , they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek , which till this hour i had never seen but pale and bloodless ; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes , which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of miss temple 's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash , nor pencilled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .
then her soul sat on her lips , and language flowed , from what source i cannot tell .
has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough , vigorous enough , to hold the swelling spring of pure , full , fervid eloquence ? such was the characteristic of helen 's discourse on that , to me , memorable evening ; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence .
they conversed of things i had never heard of ; of nations and times past ; of countries far away ; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at : they spoke of books : how many they had read !
what stores of knowledge they possessed !
then they seemed so familiar with french names and french authors : but my amazement reached its climax when miss temple asked helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the latin her father had taught her , and taking a book from a shelf , bade her read and construe a page of virgil ; and helen obeyed , my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line .
she had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime ! no delay could be admitted ; miss temple embraced us both , saying , as she drew us to her heart--
" god bless you , my children ! "
helen she held a little longer than me : she let her go more reluctantly ; it was helen her eye followed to the door ; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh ; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek .
on reaching the bedroom , we heard the voice of miss scatcherd : she was examining drawers ; she had just pulled out helen burns 's , and when we entered helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand , and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder .
" my things were indeed in shameful disorder , " murmured helen to me , in a low voice : " i intended to have arranged them , but i forgot . "
next morning , miss scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word " slattern , " and bound it like a phylactery round helen 's large , mild , intelligent , and benign-looking forehead .
she wore it till evening , patient , unresentful , regarding it as a deserved punishment .
the moment miss scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , i ran to helen , tore it off , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .
about a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated , miss temple , who had written to mr. lloyd , received his answer : it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account .
miss temple , having assembled the whole school , announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against jane eyre , and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation . the teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me , and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions .
thus relieved of a grievous load , i from that hour set to work afresh , resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty : i toiled hard , and my success was proportionate to my efforts ; my memory , not naturally tenacious , improved with practice ; exercise sharpened my wits ; in a few weeks i was promoted to a higher class ; in less than two months i was allowed to commence french and drawing .
i learned the first two tenses of the verb _ etre _ , and sketched my first cottage ( whose walls , by-the- bye , outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of pisa ) , on the same day .
that night , on going to bed , i forgot to prepare in imagination the barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes , or white bread and new milk , with which i was wont to amuse my inward cravings : i feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings , which i saw in the dark ; all the work of my own hands : freely pencilled houses and trees , picturesque rocks and ruins , cuyp-like groups of cattle , sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses , of birds picking at ripe cherries , of wren 's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs , wreathed about with young ivy sprays .
i examined , too , in thought , the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little french story which madame pierrot had that day shown me ; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere i fell sweetly asleep .
well has solomon said-- " better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . "
i would not now have exchanged lowood with all its privations for gateshead and its daily luxuries .
chapter ix
but the privations , or rather the hardships , of lowood lessened .
spring drew on : she was indeed already come ; the frosts of winter had ceased ; its snows were melted , its cutting winds ameliorated .
my wretched feet , flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of january , began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of april ; the nights and mornings no longer by their canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins ; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden : sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial , and a greenness grew over those brown beds , which , freshening daily , suggested the thought that hope traversed them at night , and left each morning brighter traces of her steps .
flowers peeped out amongst the leaves ; snow-drops , crocuses , purple auriculas , and golden-eyed pansies .
on thursday afternoons ( half-holidays ) we now took walks , and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside , under the hedges .
i discovered , too , that a great pleasure , an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded , lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden : this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow , rich in verdure and shadow ; in a bright beck , full of dark stones and sparkling eddies .
how different had this scene looked when i viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter , stiffened in frost , shrouded with snow ! --when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks , and rolled down " ing " and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck !
that beck itself was then a torrent , turbid and curbless : it tore asunder the wood , and sent a raving sound through the air , often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet ; and for the forest on its banks , _ that _ showed only ranks of skeletons .
april advanced to may : a bright serene may it was ; days of blue sky , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .
and now vegetation matured with vigour ; lowood shook loose its tresses ; it became all green , all flowery ; its great elm , ash , and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life ; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses ; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows , and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : i have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre .
all this i enjoyed often and fully , free , unwatched , and almost alone : for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause , to which it now becomes my task to advert .
have i not described a pleasant site for a dwelling , when i speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood , and rising from the verge of a stream ?
assuredly , pleasant enough : but whether healthy or not is another question .
that forest-dell , where lowood lay , was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence ; which , quickening with the quickening spring , crept into the orphan asylum , breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory , and , ere may arrived , transformed the seminary into an hospital .
semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection : forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time .
classes were broken up , rules relaxed .
the few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license ; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health : and had it been otherwise , no one had leisure to watch or restrain them .
miss temple 's whole attention was absorbed by the patients : she lived in the sick-room , never quitting it except to snatch a few hours ' rest at night . the teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion .
many , already smitten , went home only to die : some died at the school , and were buried quietly and quickly , the nature of the malady forbidding delay .
while disease had thus become an inhabitant of lowood , and death its frequent visitor ; while there was gloom and fear within its walls ; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells , the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality , that bright may shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors .
its garden , too , glowed with flowers : hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees , lilies had opened , tulips and roses were in bloom ; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies ; the sweetbriars gave out , morning and evening , their scent of spice and apples ; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of lowood , except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin .
but i , and the rest who continued well , enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season ; they let us ramble in the wood , like gipsies , from morning till night ; we did what we liked , went where we liked : we lived better too .
mr. brocklehurst and his family never came near lowood now : household matters were not scrutinised into ; the cross housekeeper was gone , driven away by the fear of infection ; her successor , who had been matron at the lowton dispensary , unused to the ways of her new abode , provided with comparative liberality .
besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast-basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a large piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .
my favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone , rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck , and only to be got at by wading through the water ; a feat i accomplished barefoot .
the stone was just broad enough to accommodate , comfortably , another girl and me , at that time my chosen comrade--one mary ann wilson ; a shrewd , observant personage , whose society i took pleasure in , partly because she was witty and original , and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease .
some years older than i , she knew more of the world , and could tell me many things i liked to hear : with her my curiosity found gratification : to my faults also she gave ample indulgence , never imposing curb or rein on anything i said .
she had a turn for narrative , i for analysis ; she liked to inform , i to question ; so we got on swimmingly together , deriving much entertainment , if not much improvement , from our mutual intercourse .
and where , meantime , was helen burns ?
why did i not spend these sweet days of liberty with her ?
had i forgotten her ? or was i so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society ?
surely the mary ann wilson i have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance : she could only tell me amusing stories , and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip i chose to indulge in ; while , if i have spoken truth of helen , she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things .
true , reader ; and i knew and felt this : and though i am a defective being , with many faults and few redeeming points , yet i never tired of helen burns ; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment , as strong , tender , and respectful as any that ever animated my heart .
how could it be otherwise , when helen , at all times and under all circumstances , evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship , which ill-humour never soured , nor irritation never troubled ?
but helen was ill at present : for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to i knew not what room upstairs .
she was not , i was told , in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients ; for her complaint was consumption , not typhus : and by consumption i , in my ignorance , understood something mild , which time and care would be sure to alleviate .
i was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons , and being taken by miss temple into the garden ; but , on these occasions , i was not allowed to go and speak to her ; i only saw her from the schoolroom window , and then not distinctly ; for she was much wrapped up , and sat at a distance under the verandah .
one evening , in the beginning of june , i had stayed out very late with mary ann in the wood ; we had , as usual , separated ourselves from the others , and had wandered far ; so far that we lost our way , and had to ask it at a lonely cottage , where a man and woman lived , who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood .
when we got back , it was after moonrise : a pony , which we knew to be the surgeon 's , was standing at the garden door . mary ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill , as mr. bates had been sent for at that time of the evening .
she went into the house ; i stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots i had dug up in the forest , and which i feared would wither if i left them till the morning .
this done , i lingered yet a little longer : the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell ; it was such a pleasant evening , so serene , so warm ; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow ; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east .
i was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might , when it entered my mind as it had never done before : --
" how sad to be lying now on a sick bed , and to be in danger of dying !
this world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it , and to have to go who knows where ? "
and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood--the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .
while pondering this new idea , i heard the front door open ; mr. bates came out , and with him was a nurse .
after she had seen him mount his horse and depart , she was about to close the door , but i ran up to her .
" how is helen burns ? "
" very poorly , " was the answer .
" is it her mr. bates has been to see ? "
" yes . "
" and what does he say about her ? "
" he says she 'll not be here long . "
this phrase , uttered in my hearing yesterday , would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to northumberland , to her own home . i should not have suspected that it meant she was dying ; but i knew instantly now !
it opened clear on my comprehension that helen burns was numbering her last days in this world , and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits , if such region there were .
i experienced a shock of horror , then a strong thrill of grief , then a desire--a necessity to see her ; and i asked in what room she lay .
" she is in miss temple 's room , " said the nurse .
" may i go up and speak to her ? "
" oh no , child ! it is not likely ; and now it is time for you to come in ; you 'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling . "
the nurse closed the front door ; i went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom : i was just in time ; it was nine o 'clock , and miss miller was calling the pupils to go to bed .
it might be two hours later , probably near eleven , when i--not having been able to fall asleep , and deeming , from the perfect silence of the dormitory , that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose softly , put on my frock over my night-dress , and , without shoes , crept from the apartment , and set off in quest of miss temple 's room .
it was quite at the other end of the house ; but i knew my way ; and the light of the unclouded summer moon , entering here and there at passage windows , enabled me to find it without difficulty .
an odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came near the fever room : and i passed its door quickly , fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me .
i dreaded being discovered and sent back ; for i _ must _ see helen , --i must embrace her before she died , --i must give her one last kiss , exchange with her one last word .
having descended a staircase , traversed a portion of the house below , and succeeded in opening and shutting , without noise , two doors , i reached another flight of steps ; these i mounted , and then just opposite to me was miss temple 's room .
a light shone through the keyhole and from under the door ; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity .
coming near , i found the door slightly ajar ; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness .
indisposed to hesitate , and full of impatient impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--i put it back and looked in .
my eye sought helen , and feared to find death . close by miss temple 's bed , and half covered with its white curtains , there stood a little crib .
i saw the outline of a form under the clothes , but the face was hid by the hangings : the nurse i had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep ; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table .
miss temple was not to be seen : i knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room .
i advanced ; then paused by the crib side : my hand was on the curtain , but i preferred speaking before i withdrew it . i still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse .
" helen ! " i whispered softly , " are you awake ? "
she stirred herself , put back the curtain , and i saw her face , pale , wasted , but quite composed : she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated .
" can it be you , jane ? " she asked , in her own gentle voice .
" oh ! " i thought , " she is not going to die ; they are mistaken : she could not speak and look so calmly if she were . "
i got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was cold , and her cheek both cold and thin , and so were her hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old .
" why are you come here , jane ? it is past eleven o 'clock : i heard it strike some minutes since . "
" i came to see you , helen : i heard you were very ill , and i could not sleep till i had spoken to you . "
" you came to bid me good-bye , then : you are just in time probably . "
" are you going somewhere , helen ? are you going home ? "
" yes ; to my long home--my last home . "
" no , no , helen ! "
i stopped , distressed .
while i tried to devour my tears , a fit of coughing seized helen ; it did not , however , wake the nurse ; when it was over , she lay some minutes exhausted ; then she whispered--
" jane , your little feet are bare ; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt . "
i did so : she put her arm over me , and i nestled close to her .
after a long silence , she resumed , still whispering--
" i am very happy , jane ; and when you hear that i am dead , you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to grieve about . we all must die one day , and the illness which is removing me is not painful ; it is gentle and gradual : my mind is at rest .
i leave no one to regret me much : i have only a father ; and he is lately married , and will not miss me .
by dying young , i shall escape great sufferings . i had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world : i should have been continually at fault . "
" but where are you going to , helen ?
can you see ? do you know ? "
" i believe ; i have faith : i am going to god . "
" where is god ?
what is god ? "
" my maker and yours , who will never destroy what he created . i rely implicitly on his power , and confide wholly in his goodness : i count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to him , reveal him to me . "
" you are sure , then , helen , that there is such a place as heaven , and that our souls can get to it when we die ? "
" i am sure there is a future state ; i believe god is good ; i can resign my immortal part to him without any misgiving .
god is my father ; god is my friend : i love him ; i believe he loves me . "
" and shall i see you again , helen , when i die ? "
" you will come to the same region of happiness : be received by the same mighty , universal parent , no doubt , dear jane . "
again i questioned , but this time only in thought . " where is that region ? does it exist ? "
and i clasped my arms closer round helen ; she seemed dearer to me than ever ; i felt as if i could not let her go ; i lay with my face hidden on her neck .
presently she said , in the sweetest tone--
" how comfortable i am ! that last fit of coughing has tired me a little ; i feel as if i could sleep : but don 't leave me , jane ; i like to have you near me . "
" i 'll stay with you , _ dear _ helen : no one shall take me away . "
" are you warm , darling ? "
" yes . "
" good-night , jane . "
" good-night , helen . "
she kissed me , and i her , and we both soon slumbered .
when i awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ; i looked up ; i was in somebody 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory .
i was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards i learned that miss temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against helen burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .
i was asleep , and helen was--dead .
her grave is in brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word " resurgam . "
chapter x
hitherto i have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence : to the first ten years of my life i have given almost as many chapters . but this is not to be a regular autobiography . i am only bound to invoke memory where i know her responses will possess some degree of interest ; therefore i now pass a space of eight years almost in silence : a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection .
when the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at lowood , it gradually disappeared from thence ; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school .
inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge , and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree . the unhealthy nature of the site ; the quantity and quality of the children 's food ; the brackish , fetid water used in its preparation ; the pupils ' wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered , and the discovery produced a result mortifying to mr. brocklehurst , but beneficial to the institution .
several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation ; new regulations were made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee .
mr. brocklehurst , who , from his wealth and family connections , could not be overlooked , still retained the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds : his office of inspector , too , was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness , comfort with economy , compassion with uprightness .
the school , thus improved , became in time a truly useful and noble institution .
i remained an inmate of its walls , after its regeneration , for eight years : six as pupil , and two as teacher ; and in both capacities i bear my testimony to its value and importance .
during these eight years my life was uniform : but not unhappy , because it was not inactive .
i had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as i loved , urged me on : i availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
in time i rose to be the first girl of the first class ; then i was invested with the office of teacher ; which i discharged with zeal for two years : but at the end of that time i altered .
miss temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction i owed the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion .
at this period she married , removed with her husband ( a clergyman , an excellent man , almost worthy of such a wife ) to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me .
from the day she left i was no longer the same : with her was gone every settled feeling , every association that had made lowood in some degree a home to me .
i had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more harmonious thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind . i had given in allegiance to duty and order ; i was quiet ; i believed i was content : to the eyes of others , usually even to my own , i appeared a disciplined and subdued character .
but destiny , in the shape of the rev. mr. nasmyth , came between me and miss temple : i saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise , shortly after the marriage ceremony ; i watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow ; and then retired to my own room , and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion .
i walked about the chamber most of the time .
i imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and i looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval i had undergone a transforming process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of miss temple--or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere i had been breathing in her vicinity--and that now i was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions .
it did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn , but rather as if a motive were gone : it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me , but the reason for tranquillity was no more .
my world had for some years been in lowood : my experience had been of its rules and systems ; now i remembered that the real world was wide , and that a varied field of hopes and fears , of sensations and excitements , awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse , to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils .
i went to my window , opened it , and looked out . there were the two wings of the building ; there was the garden ; there were the skirts of lowood ; there was the hilly horizon .
my eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote , the blue peaks ; it was those i longed to surmount ; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground , exile limits .
i traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and vanishing in a gorge between two ; how i longed to follow it farther !
i recalled the time when i had travelled that very road in a coach ; i remembered descending that hill at twilight ; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to lowood , and i had never quitted it since .
my vacations had all been spent at school : mrs. reed had never sent for me to gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me .
i had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world : school-rules , school-duties , school-habits and notions , and voices , and faces , and phrases , and costumes , and preferences , and antipathies--such was what i knew of existence .
and now i felt that it was not enough ; i tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon . i desired liberty ; for liberty i gasped ; for liberty i uttered a prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing .
i abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication ; for change , stimulus : that petition , too , seemed swept off into vague space : " then , " i cried , half desperate , " grant me at least a new servitude ! "
here a bell , ringing the hour of supper , called me downstairs .
i was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which i longed to recur , by a prolonged effusion of small talk .
how i wished sleep would silence her . it seemed as if , could i but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as i stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief .
miss gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to-night i hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; i was debarrassed of interruption ; my half-effaced thought instantly revived .
" a new servitude !
there is something in that , " i soliloquised ( mentally , be it understood ; i did not talk aloud ) , " i know there is , because it does not sound too sweet ; it is not like such words as liberty , excitement , enjoyment : delightful sounds truly ; but no more than sounds for me ; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them .
but servitude ! that must be matter of fact .
any one may serve : i have served here eight years ; now all i want is to serve elsewhere . can i not get so much of my own will ? is not the thing feasible ?
yes--yes--the end is not so difficult ; if i had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it . "
i sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; i covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then i proceeded _ to think _ again with all my might .
" what do i want ?
a new place , in a new house , amongst new faces , under new circumstances : i want this because it is of no use wanting anything better .
how do people do to get a new place ?
they apply to friends , i suppose : i have no friends .
there are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? "
i could not tell : nothing answered me ; i then ordered my brain to find a response , and quickly .
it worked and worked faster : i felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts .
feverish with vain labour , i got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .
a kind fairy , in my absence , had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow ; for as i lay down , it came quietly and naturally to my mind.-- " those who want situations advertise ; you must advertise in the _ ---shire herald _ . "
" how ?
i know nothing about advertising . "
replies rose smooth and prompt now : --
" you must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the _ herald _ ; you must put it , the first opportunity you have , into the post at lowton ; answers must be addressed to j.e. , at the post-office there ; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter , if any are come , and act accordingly . "
this scheme i went over twice , thrice ; it was then digested in my mind ; i had it in a clear practical form : i felt satisfied , and fell asleep .
with earliest day , i was up : i had my advertisement written , enclosed , and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus : --
" a young lady accustomed to tuition " ( had i not been a teacher two years ? ) " is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen ( i thought that as i was barely eighteen , it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age ) .
she is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good english education , together with french , drawing , and music " ( in those days , reader , this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments , would have been held tolerably comprehensive ) .
" address , j.e. , post-office , lowton , --- shire . "
this document remained locked in my drawer all day : after tea , i asked leave of the new superintendent to go to lowton , in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers ; permission was readily granted ; i went .
it was a walk of two miles , and the evening was wet , but the days were still long ; i visited a shop or two , slipped the letter into the post-office , and came back through heavy rain , with streaming garments , but with a relieved heart .
the succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end at last , however , like all sublunary things , and once more , towards the close of a pleasant autumn day , i found myself afoot on the road to lowton .
a picturesque track it was , by the way ; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale : but that day i thought more of the letters , that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither i was bound , than of the charms of lea and water .
my ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes ; so i discharged that business first , and when it was done , i stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker 's to the post-office : it was kept by an old dame , who wore horn spectacles on her nose , and black mittens on her hands .
" are there any letters for j.e. ? " i asked .
she peered at me over her spectacles , and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time , so long that my hopes began to falter . at last , having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes , she presented it across the counter , accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for j.e .
" is there only one ? " i demanded .
" there are no more , " said she ; and i put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward : i could not open it then ; rules obliged me to be back by eight , and it was already half-past seven .
various duties awaited me on my arrival . i had to sit with the girls during their hour of study ; then it was my turn to read prayers ; to see them to bed : afterwards i supped with the other teachers .
even when we finally retired for the night , the inevitable miss gryce was still my companion : we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick , and i dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out ; fortunately , however , the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect : she was already snoring before i had finished undressing .
there still remained an inch of candle : i now took out my letter ; the seal was an initial f. ; i broke it ; the contents were brief .
" if j.e. , who advertised in the _ ---shire herald _ of last thursday , possesses the acquirements mentioned , and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency , a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil , a little girl , under ten years of age ; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum .
j.e. is requested to send references , name , address , and all particulars to the direction : -- " mrs. fairfax , thornfield , near millcote , ---shire . "
i examined the document long : the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain , like that of an elderly lady .
this circumstance was satisfactory : a private fear had haunted me , that in thus acting for myself , and by my own guidance , i ran the risk of getting into some scrape ; and , above all things , i wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable , proper , _ en regle _ .
i now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business i had on hand .
mrs. fairfax ! i saw her in a black gown and widow 's cap ; frigid , perhaps , but not uncivil : a model of elderly english respectability .
thornfield ! that , doubtless , was the name of her house : a neat orderly spot , i was sure ; though i failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises .
millcote , ---shire ; i brushed up my recollections of the map of england , yes , i saw it ; both the shire and the town . ---shire was seventy miles nearer london than the remote county where i now resided : that was a recommendation to me .
i longed to go where there was life and movement : millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the a- ; a busy place enough , doubtless : so much the better ; it would be a complete change at least .
not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke-- " but , " i argued , " thornfield will , probably , be a good way from the town . "
here the socket of the candle dropped , and the wick went out .
next day new steps were to be taken ; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast ; i must impart them in order to achieve their success .
having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation , i told her i had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what i now received ( for at lowood i only got 15 pounds per annum ) ; and requested she would break the matter for me to mr. brocklehurst , or some of the committee , and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references .
she obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter . the next day she laid the affair before mr. brocklehurst , who said that mrs. reed must be written to , as she was my natural guardian .
a note was accordingly addressed to that lady , who returned for answer , that " i might do as i pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . "
this note went the round of the committee , and at last , after what appeared to me most tedious delay , formal leave was given me to better my condition if i could ; and an assurance added , that as i had always conducted myself well , both as teacher and pupil , at lowood , a testimonial of character and capacity , signed by the inspectors of that institution , should forthwith be furnished me .
this testimonial i accordingly received in about a month , forwarded a copy of it to mrs. fairfax , and got that lady 's reply , stating that she was satisfied , and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house .
i now busied myself in preparations : the fortnight passed rapidly . i had not a very large wardrobe , though it was adequate to my wants ; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk , --the same i had brought with me eight years ago from gateshead .
the box was corded , the card nailed on . in half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to lowton , whither i myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach .
i had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress , prepared my bonnet , gloves , and muff ; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind ; and now having nothing more to do , i sat down and tried to rest .
i could not ; though i had been on foot all day , i could not now repose an instant ; i was too much excited .
a phase of my life was closing to-night , a new one opening to-morrow : impossible to slumber in the interval ; i must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished .
" miss , " said a servant who met me in the lobby , where i was wandering like a troubled spirit , " a person below wishes to see you . "
" the carrier , no doubt , " i thought , and ran downstairs without inquiry .
i was passing the back-parlour or teachers ' sitting-room , the door of which was half open , to go to the kitchen , when some one ran out--
" it 's her , i am sure ! --i could have told her anywhere ! " cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand .
i looked : i saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant , matronly , yet still young ; very good-looking , with black hair and eyes , and lively complexion .
" well , who is it ? " she asked , in a voice and with a smile i half recognised ; " you 've not quite forgotten me , i think , miss jane ? "
in another second i was embracing and kissing her rapturously : " bessie !
bessie !
bessie ! " that was all i said ; whereat she half laughed , half cried , and we both went into the parlour .
by the fire stood a little fellow of three years old , in plaid frock and trousers .
" that is my little boy , " said bessie directly .
" then you are married , bessie ? "
" yes ; nearly five years since to robert leaven , the coachman ; and i 've a little girl besides bobby there , that i 've christened jane . "
" and you don 't live at gateshead ? "
" i live at the lodge : the old porter has left . "
" well , and how do they all get on ?
tell me everything about them , bessie : but sit down first ; and , bobby , come and sit on my knee , will you ? " but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother .
" you 're not grown so very tall , miss jane , nor so very stout , " continued mrs. leaven .
" i dare say they 've not kept you too well at school : miss reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are ; and miss georgiana would make two of you in breadth . "
" georgiana is handsome , i suppose , bessie ? "
" very .
she went up to london last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were against the match ; and--what do you think ? --he and miss georgiana made it up to run away ; but they were found out and stopped .
it was miss reed that found them out : i believe she was envious ; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together ; they are always quarrelling-- "
" well , and what of john reed ? "
" oh , he is not doing so well as his mama could wish . he went to college , and he got--plucked , i think they call it : and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister , and study the law : but he is such a dissipated young man , they will never make much of him , i think . "
" what does he look like ? "
" he is very tall : some people call him a fine-looking young man ; but he has such thick lips . "
" and mrs. reed ? "
" missis looks stout and well enough in the face , but i think she 's not quite easy in her mind : mr. john 's conduct does not please her--he spends a deal of money . "
" did she send you here , bessie ? "
" no , indeed : but i have long wanted to see you , and when i heard that there had been a letter from you , and that you were going to another part of the country , i thought i 'd just set off , and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach . "
" i am afraid you are disappointed in me , bessie . "
i said this laughing : i perceived that bessie 's glance , though it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .
" no , miss jane , not exactly : you are genteel enough ; you look like a lady , and it is as much as ever i expected of you : you were no beauty as a child . "
i smiled at bessie 's frank answer : i felt that it was correct , but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import : at eighteen most people wish to please , and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification .
" i dare say you are clever , though , " continued bessie , by way of solace . " what can you do ? can you play on the piano ? "
" a little . "
there was one in the room ; bessie went and opened it , and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune :
i played a waltz or two , and she was charmed .
" the miss reeds could not play as well ! " said she exultingly . " i always said you would surpass them in learning : and can you draw ? "
" that is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece . "
it was a landscape in water colours , of which i had made a present to the superintendent , in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf , and which she had framed and glazed .
" well , that is beautiful , miss jane ! it is as fine a picture as any miss reed 's drawing-master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt french ? "
" yes , bessie , i can both read it and speak it . "
" and you can work on muslin and canvas ? "
" i can . "
" oh , you are quite a lady , miss jane ! i knew you would be : you will get on whether your relations notice you or not .
there was something i wanted to ask you . have you ever heard anything from your father 's kinsfolk , the eyres ? "
" never in my life . "
" well , you know missis always said they were poor and quite despicable : and they may be poor ; but i believe they are as much gentry as the reeds are ; for one day , nearly seven years ago , a mr. eyre came to gateshead and wanted to see you ; missis said you were at school fifty miles off ; he seemed so much disappointed , for he could not stay : he was going on a voyage to a foreign country , and the ship was to sail from london in a day or two .
he looked quite a gentleman , and i believe he was your father 's brother . "
" what foreign country was he going to , bessie ? "
" an island thousands of miles off , where they make wine--the butler did tell me-- "
" madeira ? " i suggested .
" yes , that is it--that is the very word . "
" so he went ? "
" yes ; he did not stay many minutes in the house : missis was very high with him ; she called him afterwards a ' sneaking tradesman . '
my robert believes he was a wine-merchant . "
" very likely , " i returned ; " or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant . "
bessie and i conversed about old times an hour longer , and then she was obliged to leave me : i saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at lowton , while i was waiting for the coach .
we parted finally at the door of the brocklehurst arms there : each went her separate way ; she set off for the brow of lowood fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to gateshead , i mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of millcote .
chapter xi
a new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play ; and when i draw up the curtain this time , reader , you must fancy you see a room in the george inn at millcote , with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have ; such a carpet , such furniture , such ornaments on the mantelpiece , such prints , including a portrait of george the third , and another of the prince of wales , and a representation of the death of wolfe .
all this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling , and by that of an excellent fire , near which i sit in my cloak and bonnet ; my muff and umbrella lie on the table , and i am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours ' exposure to the rawness of an october day : i left lowton at four o 'clock a.m. , and the millcote town clock is now just striking eight .
reader , though i look comfortably accommodated , i am not very tranquil in my mind .
i thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me ; i looked anxiously round as i descended the wooden steps the " boots " placed for my convenience , expecting to hear my name pronounced , and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to thornfield .
nothing of the sort was visible ; and when i asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a miss eyre , i was answered in the negative : so i had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room : and here i am waiting , while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts .
it is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world , cut adrift from every connection , uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached , and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted .
the charm of adventure sweetens that sensation , the glow of pride warms it ; but then the throb of fear disturbs it ; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still i was alone .
i bethought myself to ring the bell .
" is there a place in this neighbourhood called thornfield ? " i asked of the waiter who answered the summons .
" thornfield ?
i don 't know , ma 'am ; i 'll inquire at the bar . "
he vanished , but reappeared instantly--
" is your name eyre , miss ? "
" yes . "
" person here waiting for you . "
i jumped up , took my muff and umbrella , and hastened into the inn-passage : a man was standing by the open door , and in the lamp-lit street i dimly saw a one-horse conveyance .
" this will be your luggage , i suppose ? " said the man rather abruptly when he saw me , pointing to my trunk in the passage .
" yes . "
he hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then i got in ; before he shut me up , i asked him how far it was to thornfield .
" a matter of six miles . "
" how long shall we be before we get there ? "
" happen an hour and a half . "
he fastened the car door , climbed to his own seat outside , and we set off .
our progress was leisurely , and gave me ample time to reflect ; i was content to be at length so near the end of my journey ; and as i leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance , i meditated much at my ease .
" i suppose , " thought i , " judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , mrs. fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ; i never lived amongst fine people but once , and i was very miserable with them .
i wonder if she lives alone except this little girl ; if so , and if she is in any degree amiable , i shall surely be able to get on with her ; i will do my best ; it is a pity that doing one 's best does not always answer .
at lowood , indeed , i took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in pleasing ; but with mrs. reed , i remember my best was always spurned with scorn .
i pray god mrs. fairfax may not turn out a second mrs. reed ; but if she does , i am not bound to stay with her ! let the worst come to the worst , i can advertise again .
how far are we on our road now , i wonder ? "
i let down the window and looked out ; millcote was behind us ; judging by the number of its lights , it seemed a place of considerable magnitude , much larger than lowton . we were now , as far as i could see , on a sort of common ; but there were houses scattered all over the district ; i felt we were in a different region to lowood , more populous , less picturesque ; more stirring , less romantic .
the roads were heavy , the night misty ; my conductor let his horse walk all the way , and the hour and a half extended , i verily believe , to two hours ; at last he turned in his seat and said--
" you 're noan so far fro ' thornfield now . "
again i looked out : we were passing a church ; i saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; i saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .
about ten minutes after , the driver got down and opened a pair of gates : we passed through , and they clashed to behind us .
we now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a house : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window ; all the rest were dark .
the car stopped at the front door ; it was opened by a maid-servant ; i alighted and went in .
" will you walk this way , ma 'am ? " said the girl ; and i followed her across a square hall with high doors all round : she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me , contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured ; when i could see , however , a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view .
a snug small room ; a round table by a cheerful fire ; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned , wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady , in widow 's cap , black silk gown , and snowy muslin apron ; exactly like what i had fancied mrs. fairfax , only less stately and milder looking .
she was occupied in knitting ; a large cat sat demurely at her feet ; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort .
a more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived ; there was no grandeur to overwhelm , no stateliness to embarrass ; and then , as i entered , the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me .
" how do you do , my dear ? i am afraid you have had a tedious ride ; john drives so slowly ; you must be cold , come to the fire . "
" mrs. fairfax , i suppose ? " said i .
" yes , you are right : do sit down . "
she conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings ; i begged she would not give herself so much trouble .
" oh , it is no trouble ; i dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold . leah , make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two : here are the keys of the storeroom . "
and she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys , and delivered them to the servant .
" now , then , draw nearer to the fire , " she continued .
" you 've brought your luggage with you , haven 't you , my dear ? "
" yes , ma 'am . "
" i 'll see it carried into your room , " she said , and bustled out .
" she treats me like a visitor , " thought i .
" i little expected such a reception ; i anticipated only coldness and stiffness : this is not like what i have heard of the treatment of governesses ; but i must not exult too soon . "
she returned ; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table , to make room for the tray which leah now brought , and then herself handed me the refreshments .
i felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than i had ever before received , and , that too , shown by my employer and superior ; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place , i thought it better to take her civilities quietly .
" shall i have the pleasure of seeing miss fairfax to-night ? " i asked , when i had partaken of what she offered me .
" what did you say , my dear ? i am a little deaf , " returned the good lady , approaching her ear to my mouth .
i repeated the question more distinctly .
" miss fairfax ?
oh , you mean miss varens !
varens is the name of your future pupil . "
" indeed !
then she is not your daughter ? "
" no , --i have no family . "
i should have followed up my first inquiry , by asking in what way miss varens was connected with her ; but i recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions : besides , i was sure to hear in time .
" i am so glad , " she continued , as she sat down opposite to me , and took the cat on her knee ; " i am so glad you are come ; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion .
to be sure it is pleasant at any time ; for thornfield is a fine old hall , rather neglected of late years perhaps , but still it is a respectable place ; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters .
i say alone--leah is a nice girl to be sure , and john and his wife are very decent people ; but then you see they are only servants , and one can 't converse with them on terms of equality : one must keep them at due distance , for fear of losing one 's authority .
i 'm sure last winter ( it was a very severe one , if you recollect , and when it did not snow , it rained and blew ) , not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house , from november till february ; and i really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone ; i had leah in to read to me sometimes ; but i don 't think the poor girl liked the task much : she felt it confining .
in spring and summer one got on better : sunshine and long days make such a difference ; and then , just at the commencement of this autumn , little adela varens came and her nurse : a child makes a house alive all at once ; and now you are here i shall be quite gay . "
my heart really warmed to the worthy lady as i heard her talk ; and i drew my chair a little nearer to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .
" but i 'll not keep you sitting up late to-night , " said she ; " it is on the stroke of twelve now , and you have been travelling all day : you must feel tired .
if you have got your feet well warmed , i 'll show you your bedroom . i 've had the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small apartment , but i thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer furniture , but they are so dreary and solitary , i never sleep in them myself . "
i thanked her for her considerate choice , and as i really felt fatigued with my long journey , expressed my readiness to retire .
she took her candle , and i followed her from the room .
first she went to see if the hall-door was fastened ; having taken the key from the lock , she led the way upstairs .
the steps and banisters were of oak ; the staircase window was high and latticed ; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house .
a very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery , suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude ; and i was glad , when finally ushered into my chamber , to find it of small dimensions , and furnished in ordinary , modern style .
when mrs. fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night , and i had fastened my door , gazed leisurely round , and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall , that dark and spacious staircase , and that long , cold gallery , by the livelier aspect of my little room , i remembered that , after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety , i was now at last in safe haven .
the impulse of gratitude swelled my heart , and i knelt down at the bedside , and offered up thanks where thanks were due ; not forgetting , ere i rose , to implore aid on my further path , and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned .
my couch had no thorns in it that night ; my solitary room no fears .
at once weary and content , i slept soon and soundly : when i awoke it was broad day .
the chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains , showing papered walls and a carpeted floor , so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of lowood , that my spirits rose at the view .
externals have a great effect on the young : i thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me , one that was to have its flowers and pleasures , as well as its thorns and toils .
my faculties , roused by the change of scene , the new field offered to hope , seemed all astir . i cannot precisely define what they expected , but it was something pleasant : not perhaps that day or that month , but at an indefinite future period .
i rose ; i dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain--for i had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--i was still by nature solicitous to be neat .
it was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression i made : on the contrary , i ever wished to look as well as i could , and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit .
i sometimes regretted that i was not handsomer ; i sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks , a straight nose , and small cherry mouth ; i desired to be tall , stately , and finely developed in figure ; i felt it a misfortune that i was so little , so pale , and had features so irregular and so marked .
and why had i these aspirations and these regrets ?
it would be difficult to say : i could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet i had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
however , when i had brushed my hair very smooth , and put on my black frock--which , quakerlike as it was , at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker , i thought i should do respectably enough to appear before mrs. fairfax , and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy .
having opened my chamber window , and seen that i left all things straight and neat on the toilet table , i ventured forth .
traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .
everything appeared very stately and imposing to me ; but then i was so little accustomed to grandeur .
the hall-door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .
it was a fine autumn morning ; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields ; advancing on to the lawn , i looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion .
it was three storeys high , of proportions not vast , though considerable : a gentleman 's manor-house , not a nobleman 's seat : battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look .
its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery , whose cawing tenants were now on the wing : they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow , from which these were separated by a sunk fence , and where an array of mighty old thorn trees , strong , knotty , and broad as oaks , at once explained the etymology of the mansion 's designation .
farther off were hills : not so lofty as those round lowood , nor so craggy , nor so like barriers of separation from the living world ; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough , and seeming to embrace thornfield with a seclusion i had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of millcote .
a little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer thornfield : its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .
i was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air , yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks , yet surveying the wide , hoary front of the hall , and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like mrs. fairfax to inhabit , when that lady appeared at the door .
" what ! out already ? " said she . " i see you are an early riser . "
i went up to her , and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand .
" how do you like thornfield ? " she asked .
i told her i liked it very much .
" yes , " she said , " it is a pretty place ; but i fear it will be getting out of order , unless mr. rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently ; or , at least , visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor . "
" mr. rochester ! " i exclaimed . " who is he ? "
" the owner of thornfield , " she responded quietly . " did you not know he was called rochester ? "
of course i did not--i had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .
" i thought , " i continued , " thornfield belonged to you . "
" to me ? bless you , child ; what an idea !
to me ! i am only the housekeeper--the manager .
to be sure i am distantly related to the rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he was a clergyman , incumbent of hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and that church near the gates was his .
the present mr. rochester 's mother was a fairfax , and second cousin to my husband : but i never presume on the connection--in fact , it is nothing to me ; i consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper : my employer is always civil , and i expect nothing more . "
" and the little girl--my pupil ! "
" she is mr. rochester 's ward ; he commissioned me to find a governess for her .
he intended to have her brought up in ---shire , i believe .
here she comes , with her ' bonne , ' as she calls her nurse . "
the enigma then was explained : this affable and kind little widow was no great dame ; but a dependant like myself .
i did not like her the worse for that ; on the contrary , i felt better pleased than ever .
the equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension on her part : so much the better--my position was all the freer .
as i was meditating on this discovery , a little girl , followed by her attendant , came running up the lawn .
i looked at my pupil , who did not at first appear to notice me : she was quite a child , perhaps seven or eight years old , slightly built , with a pale , small-featured face , and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist .
" good morning , miss adela , " said mrs. fairfax .
" come and speak to the lady who is to teach you , and to make you a clever woman some day . "
she approached .
" c 'est la ma gouverante ! " said she , pointing to me , and addressing her nurse ; who answered-- " mais oui , certainement . "
" are they foreigners ? " i inquired , amazed at hearing the french language .
" the nurse is a foreigner , and adela was born on the continent ; and , i believe , never left it till within six months ago .
when she first came here she could speak no english ; now she can make shift to talk it a little : i don 't understand her , she mixes it so with french ; but you will make out her meaning very well , i dare say . "
fortunately i had had the advantage of being taught french by a french lady ; and as i had always made a point of conversing with madame pierrot as often as i could , and had besides , during the last seven years , learnt a portion of french by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my accent , and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher , i had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language , and was not likely to be much at a loss with mademoiselle adela .
she came and shook hand with me when she heard that i was her governess ; and as i led her in to breakfast , i addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue : she replied briefly at first , but after we were seated at the table , and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes , she suddenly commenced chattering fluently .
" ah ! " cried she , in french , " you speak my language as well as mr. rochester does : i can talk to you as i can to him , and so can sophie .
she will be glad : nobody here understands her : madame fairfax is all english .
sophie is my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked--how it did smoke ! --and i was sick , and so was sophie , and so was mr. rochester .
mr. rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon , and sophie and i had little beds in another place . i nearly fell out of mine ; it was like a shelf .
and mademoiselle--what is your name ? "
" eyre--jane eyre . "
" aire ?
bah !
i cannot say it .
well , our ship stopped in the morning , before it was quite daylight , at a great city--a huge city , with very dark houses and all smoky ; not at all like the pretty clean town i came from ; and mr. rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land , and sophie came after , and we all got into a coach , which took us to a beautiful large house , larger than this and finer , called an hotel .
we stayed there nearly a week : i and sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the park ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that i fed with crumbs . "
" can you understand her when she runs on so fast ? " asked mrs. fairfax .
i understood her very well , for i had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of madame pierrot .
" i wish , " continued the good lady , " you would ask her a question or two about her parents : i wonder if she remembers them ? "
" adele , " i inquired , " with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ? "
" i lived long ago with mama ; but she is gone to the holy virgin .
mama used to teach me to dance and sing , and to say verses . a great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama , and i used to dance before them , or to sit on their knees and sing to them : i liked it .
shall i let you hear me sing now ? "
she had finished her breakfast , so i permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments .
descending from her chair , she came and placed herself on my knee ; then , folding her little hands demurely before her , shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling , she commenced singing a song from some opera .
it was the strain of a forsaken lady , who , after bewailing the perfidy of her lover , calls pride to her aid ; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes , and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball , and prove to him , by the gaiety of her demeanour , how little his desertion has affected her .
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but i suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least i thought so .
this achieved , she jumped from my knee and said , " now , mademoiselle , i will repeat you some poetry . "
assuming an attitude , she began , " la ligue des rats : fable de la fontaine . "
she then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis , a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture , very unusual indeed at her age , and which proved she had been carefully trained .
" was it your mama who taught you that piece ? " i asked .
" yes , and she just used to say it in this way : ' qu ' avez vous donc ? lui dit un de ces rats ; parlez ! ' she made me lift my hand--so--to remind me to raise my voice at the question .
now shall i dance for you ? "
" no , that will do : but after your mama went to the holy virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ? "
" with madame frederic and her husband : she took care of me , but she is nothing related to me .
i think she is poor , for she had not so fine a house as mama .
i was not long there .
mr. rochester asked me if i would like to go and live with him in england , and i said yes ; for i knew mr. rochester before i knew madame frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to england , and now he is gone back again himself , and i never see him . "
after breakfast , adele and i withdrew to the library , which room , it appears , mr. rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom .
most of the books were locked up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works , and several volumes of light literature , poetry , biography , travels , a few romances , & c .
i suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal ; and , indeed , they contented me amply for the present ; compared with the scanty pickings i had now and then been able to glean at lowood , they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information .
in this room , too , there was a cabinet piano , quite new and of superior tone ; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes .
i found my pupil sufficiently docile , though disinclined to apply : she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind .
i felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first ; so , when i had talked to her a great deal , and got her to learn a little , and when the morning had advanced to noon , i allowed her to return to her nurse .
i then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use .
as i was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils , mrs. fairfax called to me : " your morning school-hours are over now , i suppose , " said she .
she was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open : i went in when she addressed me .
it was a large , stately apartment , with purple chairs and curtains , a turkey carpet , walnut-panelled walls , one vast window rich in slanted glass , and a lofty ceiling , nobly moulded .
mrs. fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar , which stood on a sideboard .
" what a beautiful room ! " i exclaimed , as i looked round ; for i had never before seen any half so imposing .
" yes ; this is the dining-room . i have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault . "
she pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window , and hung like it with a tyrian-dyed curtain , now looped up .
mounting to it by two broad steps , and looking through , i thought i caught a glimpse of a fairy place , so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond .
yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room , and within it a boudoir , both spread with white carpets , on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers ; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves , beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans ; while the ornaments on the pale parian mantelpiece were of sparkling bohemian glass , ruby red ; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire .
" in what order you keep these rooms , mrs. fairfax ! " said i .
" no dust , no canvas coverings : except that the air feels chilly , one would think they were inhabited daily . "
" why , miss eyre , though mr. rochester 's visits here are rare , they are always sudden and unexpected ; and as i observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up , and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival , i thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness . "
" is mr. rochester an exacting , fastidious sort of man ? "
" not particularly so ; but he has a gentleman 's tastes and habits , and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them . "
" do you like him ? is he generally liked ? "
" oh , yes ; the family have always been respected here .
almost all the land in this neighbourhood , as far as you can see , has belonged to the rochesters time out of mind . "
" well , but , leaving his land out of the question , do you like him ?
is he liked for himself ? "
" i have no cause to do otherwise than like him ; and i believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants : but he has never lived much amongst them . "
" but has he no peculiarities ?
what , in short , is his character ? "
" oh ! his character is unimpeachable , i suppose . he is rather peculiar , perhaps : he has travelled a great deal , and seen a great deal of the world , i should think . i dare say he is clever , but i never had much conversation with him . "
" in what way is he peculiar ? "
" i don 't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking , but you feel it when he speaks to you ; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest , whether he is pleased or the contrary ; you don 't thoroughly understand him , in short--at least , i don 't : but it is of no consequence , he is a very good master . "
this was all the account i got from mrs. fairfax of her employer and mine .
there are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character , or observing and describing salient points , either in persons or things : the good lady evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puzzled , but did not draw her out .
mr. rochester was mr. rochester in her eyes ; a gentleman , a landed proprietor--nothing more : she inquired and searched no further , and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity .
when we left the dining-room , she proposed to show me over the rest of the house ; and i followed her upstairs and downstairs , admiring as i went ; for all was well arranged and handsome .
the large front chambers i thought especially grand : and some of the third-storey rooms , though dark and low , were interesting from their air of antiquity .
the furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here , as fashions changed : and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old ; chests in oak or walnut , looking , with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs ' heads , like types of the hebrew ark ; rows of venerable chairs , high-backed and narrow ; stools still more antiquated , on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries , wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust .
all these relics gave to the third storey of thornfield hall the aspect of a home of the past : a shrine of memory .
i liked the hush , the gloom , the quaintness of these retreats in the day ; but i by no means coveted a night 's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds : shut in , some of them , with doors of oak ; shaded , others , with wrought old english hangings crusted with thick work , portraying effigies of strange flowers , and stranger birds , and strangest human beings , --all which would have looked strange , indeed , by the pallid gleam of moonlight .
" do the servants sleep in these rooms ? " i asked .
" no ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back ; no one ever sleeps here : one would almost say that , if there were a ghost at thornfield hall , this would be its haunt . "
" so i think : you have no ghost , then ? "
" none that i ever heard of , " returned mrs. fairfax , smiling .
" nor any traditions of one ? no legends or ghost stories ? "
" i believe not . and yet it is said the rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time : perhaps , though , that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now . "
" yes-- ' after life 's fitful fever they sleep well , ' " i muttered .
" where are you going now , mrs. fairfax ? " for she was moving away .
" on to the leads ; will you come and see the view from thence ? "
i followed still , up a very narrow staircase to the attics , and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall .
i was now on a level with the crow colony , and could see into their nests .
leaning over the battlements and looking far down , i surveyed the grounds laid out like a map : the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion ; the field , wide as a park , dotted with its ancient timber ; the wood , dun and sere , divided by a path visibly overgrown , greener with moss than the trees were with foliage ; the church at the gates , the road , the tranquil hills , all reposing in the autumn day 's sun ; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky , azure , marbled with pearly white .
no feature in the scene was extraordinary , but all was pleasing .
when i turned from it and repassed the trap-door , i could scarcely see my way down the ladder ; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which i had been looking up , and to that sunlit scene of grove , pasture , and green hill , of which the hall was the centre , and over which i had been gazing with delight .
mrs. fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door ; i , by drift of groping , found the outlet from the attic , and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase .
i lingered in the long passage to which this led , separating the front and back rooms of the third storey : narrow , low , and dim , with only one little window at the far end , and looking , with its two rows of small black doors all shut , like a corridor in some bluebeard 's castle .
while i paced softly on , the last sound i expected to hear in so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear . it was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .
i stopped : the sound ceased , only for an instant ; it began again , louder : for at first , though distinct , it was very low . it passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber ; though it originated but in one , and i could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued .
" mrs. fairfax ! " i called out : for i now heard her descending the great stairs . " did you hear that loud laugh ? who is it ? "
" some of the servants , very likely , " she answered : " perhaps grace poole . "
" did you hear it ? " i again inquired .
" yes , plainly : i often hear her : she sews in one of these rooms .
sometimes leah is with her ; they are frequently noisy together . "
the laugh was repeated in its low , syllabic tone , and terminated in an odd murmur .
" grace ! " exclaimed mrs. fairfax .
i really did not expect any grace to answer ; for the laugh was as tragic , as preternatural a laugh as any i ever heard ; and , but that it was high noon , and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation ; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear , i should have been superstitiously afraid .
however , the event showed me i was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise .
the door nearest me opened , and a servant came out , --a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set , square-made figure , red-haired , and with a hard , plain face : any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived .
" too much noise , grace , " said mrs. fairfax . " remember directions ! "
grace curtseyed silently and went in .
" she is a person we have to sew and assist leah in her housemaid 's work , " continued the widow ; " not altogether unobjectionable in some points , but she does well enough .
by-the-bye , how have you got on with your new pupil this morning ? "
the conversation , thus turned on adele , continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below .
adele came running to meet us in the hall , exclaiming--
" mesdames , vous etes servies ! " adding , " j 'ai bien faim , moi ! "
we found dinner ready , and waiting for us in mrs. fairfax 's room .
chapter xii
the promise of a smooth career , which my first calm introduction to thornfield hall seemed to pledge , was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates .
mrs. fairfax turned out to be what she appeared , a placid-tempered , kind-natured woman , of competent education and average intelligence .
my pupil was a lively child , who had been spoilt and indulged , and therefore was sometimes wayward ; but as she was committed entirely to my care , and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement , she soon forgot her little freaks , and became obedient and teachable .
she had no great talents , no marked traits of character , no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it .
she made reasonable progress , entertained for me a vivacious , though perhaps not very profound , affection ; and by her simplicity , gay prattle , and efforts to please , inspired me , in return , with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other 's society .
this , _ par parenthese _ , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children , and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion : but i am not writing to flatter parental egotism , to echo cant , or prop up humbug ; i am merely telling the truth .
i felt a conscientious solicitude for adele 's welfare and progress , and a quiet liking for her little self : just as i cherished towards mrs. fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness , and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me , and the moderation of her mind and character .
anybody may blame me who likes , when i add further , that , now and then , when i took a walk by myself in the grounds ; when i went down to the gates and looked through them along the road ; or when , while adele played with her nurse , and mrs. fairfax made jellies in the storeroom , i climbed the three staircases , raised the trap-door of the attic , and having reached the leads , looked out afar over sequestered field and hill , and along dim sky-line--that then i longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit ; which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life i had heard of but never seen--that then i desired more of practical experience than i possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind , of acquaintance with variety of character , than was here within my reach .
i valued what was good in mrs. fairfax , and what was good in adele ; but i believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness , and what i believed in i wished to behold .
who blames me ? many , no doubt ; and i shall be called discontented . i could not help it : the restlessness was in my nature ; it agitated me to pain sometimes .
then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey , backwards and forwards , safe in the silence and solitude of the spot , and allow my mind 's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it--and , certainly , they were many and glowing ; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement , which , while it swelled it in trouble , expanded it with life ; and , best of all , to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created , and narrated continuously ; quickened with all of incident , life , fire , feeling , that i desired and had not in my actual existence .
it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity : they must have action ; and they will make it if they cannot find it . millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine , and millions are in silent revolt against their lot .
nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth .
women are supposed to be very calm generally : but women feel just as men feel ; they need exercise for their faculties , and a field for their efforts , as much as their brothers do ; they suffer from too rigid a restraint , too absolute a stagnation , precisely as men would suffer ; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings , to playing on the piano and embroidering bags .
it is thoughtless to condemn them , or laugh at them , if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex .
when thus alone , i not unfrequently heard grace poole 's laugh : the same peal , the same low , slow ha ! ha ! which , when first heard , had thrilled me : i heard , too , her eccentric murmurs ; stranger than her laugh .
there were days when she was quite silent ; but there were others when i could not account for the sounds she made .
sometimes i saw her : she would come out of her room with a basin , or a plate , or a tray in her hand , go down to the kitchen and shortly return , generally ( oh , romantic reader , forgive me for telling the plain truth ! ) bearing a pot of porter .
her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities : hard-featured and staid , she had no point to which interest could attach .
i made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .
the other members of the household , viz . , john and his wife , leah the housemaid , and sophie the french nurse , were decent people ; but in no respect remarkable ; with sophie i used to talk french , and sometimes i asked her questions about her native country ; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn , and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry .
october , november , december passed away .
one afternoon in january , mrs. fairfax had begged a holiday for adele , because she had a cold ; and , as adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood , i accorded it , deeming that i did well in showing pliability on the point .
it was a fine , calm day , though very cold ; i was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning : mrs. fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted , so i put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to hay ; the distance , two miles , would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk .
having seen adele comfortably seated in her little chair by mrs. fairfax 's parlour fireside , and given her her best wax doll ( which i usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer ) to play with , and a story-book for change of amusement ; and having replied to her " revenez bientot , ma bonne amie , ma chere mdlle .
jeannette , " with a kiss i set out .
the ground was hard , the air was still , my road was lonely ; i walked fast till i got warm , and then i walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation .
it was three o 'clock ; the church bell tolled as i passed under the belfry : the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness , in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun .
i was a mile from thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .
if a breath of air stirred , it made no sound here ; for there was not a holly , not an evergreen to rustle , and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white , worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path .
far and wide , on each side , there were only fields , where no cattle now browsed ; and the little brown birds , which stirred occasionally in the hedge , looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop .
this lane inclined up-hill all the way to hay ; having reached the middle , i sat down on a stile which led thence into a field . gathering my mantle about me , and sheltering my hands in my muff , i did not feel the cold , though it froze keenly ; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway , where a little brooklet , now congealed , had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since .
from my seat i could look down on thornfield : the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me ; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west .
i lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees , and sank crimson and clear behind them . i then turned eastward .
on the hill-top above me sat the rising moon ; pale yet as a cloud , but brightening momentarily , she looked over hay , which , half lost in trees , sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys : it was yet a mile distant , but in the absolute hush i could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life .
my ear , too , felt the flow of currents ; in what dales and depths i could not tell : but there were many hills beyond hay , and doubtless many becks threading their passes .
that evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams , the sough of the most remote .
a rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings , at once so far away and so clear : a positive tramp , tramp , a metallic clatter , which effaced the soft wave-wanderings ; as , in a picture , the solid mass of a crag , or the rough boles of a great oak , drawn in dark and strong on the foreground , efface the aerial distance of azure hill , sunny horizon , and blended clouds where tint melts into tint .
the din was on the causeway : a horse was coming ; the windings of the lane yet hid it , but it approached .
i was just leaving the stile ; yet , as the path was narrow , i sat still to let it go by .
in those days i was young , and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind : the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish ; and when they recurred , maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give .
as this horse approached , and as i watched for it to appear through the dusk , i remembered certain of bessie 's tales , wherein figured a north-of-england spirit called a " gytrash , " which , in the form of horse , mule , or large dog , haunted solitary ways , and sometimes came upon belated travellers , as this horse was now coming upon me .
it was very near , but not yet in sight ; when , in addition to the tramp , tramp , i heard a rush under the hedge , and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog , whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees .
it was exactly one form of bessie 's gytrash--a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head : it passed me , however , quietly enough ; not staying to look up , with strange pretercanine eyes , in my face , as i half expected it would .
the horse followed , --a tall steed , and on its back a rider .
the man , the human being , broke the spell at once . nothing ever rode the gytrash : it was always alone ; and goblins , to my notions , though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts , could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form .
no gytrash was this , --only a traveller taking the short cut to millcote .
he passed , and i went on ; a few steps , and i turned : a sliding sound and an exclamation of " what the deuce is to do now ? " and a clattering tumble , arrested my attention .
man and horse were down ; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway .
the dog came bounding back , and seeing his master in a predicament , and hearing the horse groan , barked till the evening hills echoed the sound , which was deep in proportion to his magnitude .
he snuffed round the prostrate group , and then he ran up to me ; it was all he could do , --there was no other help at hand to summon .
i obeyed him , and walked down to the traveller , by this time struggling himself free of his steed .
his efforts were so vigorous , i thought he could not be much hurt ; but i asked him the question--
" are you injured , sir ? "
i think he was swearing , but am not certain ; however , he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly .
" can i do anything ? " i asked again .
" you must just stand on one side , " he answered as he rose , first to his knees , and then to his feet .
i did ; whereupon began a heaving , stamping , clattering process , accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards ' distance ; but i would not be driven quite away till i saw the event .
this was finally fortunate ; the horse was re-established , and the dog was silenced with a " down , pilot ! "
the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down .
i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .
" if you are hurt , and want help , sir , i can fetch some one either from thornfield hall or from hay . "
" thank you : i shall do : i have no broken bones , --only a sprain ; " and again he stood up and tried his foot , but the result extorted an involuntary " ugh ! "
something of daylight still lingered , and the moon was waxing bright : i could see him plainly .
his figure was enveloped in a riding cloak , fur collared and steel clasped ; its details were not apparent , but i traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest .
he had a dark face , with stern features and a heavy brow ; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now ; he was past youth , but had not reached middle-age ; perhaps he might be thirty-five .
i felt no fear of him , and but little shyness .
had he been a handsome , heroic- looking young gentleman , i should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will , and offering my services unasked .
i had hardly ever seen a handsome youth ; never in my life spoken to one .
i had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty , elegance , gallantry , fascination ; but had i met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape , i should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me , and should have shunned them as one would fire , lightning , or anything else that is bright but antipathetic .
if even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when i addressed him ; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks , i should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries : but the frown , the roughness of the traveller , set me at my ease : i retained my station when he waved to me to go , and announced--
" i cannot think of leaving you , sir , at so late an hour , in this solitary lane , till i see you are fit to mount your horse . "
he looked at me when i said this ; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before .
" i should think you ought to be at home yourself , " said he , " if you have a home in this neighbourhood : where do you come from ? "
" from just below ; and i am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight : i will run over to hay for you with pleasure , if you wish it : indeed , i am going there to post a letter . "
" you live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements ? " pointing to thornfield hall , on which the moon cast a hoary gleam , bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that , by contrast with the western sky , now seemed one mass of shadow .
" yes , sir . "
" whose house is it ? "
" mr. rochester 's . "
" do you know mr. rochester ? "
" no , i have never seen him . "
" he is not resident , then ? "
" no . "
" can you tell me where he is ? "
" i cannot . "
" you are not a servant at the hall , of course .
you are-- " he stopped , ran his eye over my dress , which , as usual , was quite simple : a black merino cloak , a black beaver bonnet ; neither of them half fine enough for a lady 's-maid . he seemed puzzled to decide what i was ; i helped him .
" i am the governess . "
" ah , the governess ! " he repeated ; " deuce take me , if i had not forgotten !
the governess ! " and again my raiment underwent scrutiny .
in two minutes he rose from the stile : his face expressed pain when he tried to move .
" i cannot commission you to fetch help , " he said ; " but you may help me a little yourself , if you will be so kind . "
" yes , sir . "
" you have not an umbrella that i can use as a stick ? "
" no . "
" try to get hold of my horse 's bridle and lead him to me : you are not afraid ? "
i should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone , but when told to do it , i was disposed to obey .
i put down my muff on the stile , and went up to the tall steed ; i endeavoured to catch the bridle , but it was a spirited thing , and would not let me come near its head ; i made effort on effort , though in vain : meantime , i was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet .
the traveller waited and watched for some time , and at last he laughed .
" i see , " he said , " the mountain will never be brought to mahomet , so all you can do is to aid mahomet to go to the mountain ; i must beg of you to come here . "
i came .
" excuse me , " he continued : " necessity compels me to make you useful . "
he laid a heavy hand on my shoulder , and leaning on me with some stress , limped to his horse . having once caught the bridle , he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle ; grimacing grimly as he made the effort , for it wrenched his sprain .
" now , " said he , releasing his under lip from a hard bite , " just hand me my whip ; it lies there under the hedge . "
i sought it and found it .
" thank you ; now make haste with the letter to hay , and return as fast as you can . "
a touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear , and then bound away ; the dog rushed in his traces ; all three vanished , " like heath that , in the wilderness , the wild wind whirls away . "
i took up my muff and walked on .
the incident had occurred and was gone for me : it _ was _ an incident of no moment , no romance , no interest in a sense ; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life .
my help had been needed and claimed ; i had given it : i was pleased to have done something ; trivial , transitory though the deed was , it was yet an active thing , and i was weary of an existence all passive .
the new face , too , was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory ; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there : firstly , because it was masculine ; and , secondly , because it was dark , strong , and stern .
i had it still before me when i entered hay , and slipped the letter into the post-office ; i saw it as i walked fast down-hill all the way home .
when i came to the stile , i stopped a minute , looked round and listened , with an idea that a horse 's hoofs might ring on the causeway again , and that a rider in a cloak , and a gytrash-like newfoundland dog , might be again apparent : i saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me , rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams ; i heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round thornfield , a mile distant ; and when i glanced down in the direction of the murmur , my eye , traversing the hall-front , caught a light kindling in a window : it reminded me that i was late , and i hurried on .
i did not like re-entering thornfield .
to pass its threshold was to return to stagnation ; to cross the silent hall , to ascend the darksome staircase , to seek my own lonely little room , and then to meet tranquil mrs. fairfax , and spend the long winter evening with her , and her only , was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk , --to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence ; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease i was becoming incapable of appreciating .
what good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life , and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which i now repined !
yes , just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a " too easy chair " to take a long walk : and just as natural was the wish to stir , under my circumstances , as it would be under his .
i lingered at the gates ; i lingered on the lawn ; i paced backwards and forwards on the pavement ; the shutters of the glass door were closed ; i could not see into the interior ; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells , as it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me , --a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud ; the moon ascending it in solemn march ; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops , from behind which she had come , far and farther below her , and aspired to the zenith , midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance ; and for those trembling stars that followed her course ; they made my heart tremble , my veins glow when i viewed them .
little things recall us to earth ; the clock struck in the hall ; that sufficed ; i turned from moon and stars , opened a side- door , and went in .
the hall was not dark , nor yet was it lit , only by the high-hung bronze lamp ; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase .
this ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room , whose two- leaved door stood open , and showed a genial fire in the grate , glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons , and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture , in the most pleasant radiance .
it revealed , too , a group near the mantelpiece : i had scarcely caught it , and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices , amongst which i seemed to distinguish the tones of adele , when the door closed .
i hastened to mrs. fairfax 's room ; there was a fire there too , but no candle , and no mrs. fairfax .
instead , all alone , sitting upright on the rug , and gazing with gravity at the blaze , i beheld a great black and white long-haired dog , just like the gytrash of the lane .
it was so like it that i went forward and said-- " pilot " and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me .
i caressed him , and he wagged his great tail ; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with , and i could not tell whence he had come . i rang the bell , for i wanted a candle ; and i wanted , too , to get an account of this visitant .
leah entered .
" what dog is this ? "
" he came with master . "
" with whom ? "
" with master--mr . rochester--he is just arrived . "
" indeed ! and is mrs. fairfax with him ? "
" yes , and miss adele ; they are in the dining-room , and john is gone for a surgeon ; for master has had an accident ; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained . "
" did the horse fall in hay lane ? "
" yes , coming down-hill ; it slipped on some ice . "
" ah !
bring me a candle will you leah ? "
leah brought it ; she entered , followed by mrs. fairfax , who repeated the news ; adding that mr. carter the surgeon was come , and was now with mr. rochester : then she hurried out to give orders about tea , and i went upstairs to take off my things .
chapter xiii
mr. rochester , it seems , by the surgeon 's orders , went to bed early that night ; nor did he rise soon next morning .
when he did come down , it was to attend to business : his agent and some of his tenants were arrived , and waiting to speak with him .
adele and i had now to vacate the library : it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers .
a fire was lit in an apartment upstairs , and there i carried our books , and arranged it for the future schoolroom .
i discerned in the course of the morning that thornfield hall was a changed place : no longer silent as a church , it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door , or a clang of the bell ; steps , too , often traversed the hall , and new voices spoke in different keys below ; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it ; it had a master : for my part , i liked it better .
adele was not easy to teach that day ; she could not apply : she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of mr. rochester ; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs , in order , as i shrewdly suspected , to visit the library , where i knew she was not wanted ; then , when i got a little angry , and made her sit still , she continued to talk incessantly of her " ami , monsieur edouard fairfax _ de _ rochester , " as she dubbed him ( i had not before heard his prenomens ) , and to conjecture what presents he had brought her : for it appears he had intimated the night before , that when his luggage came from millcote , there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest .
" et cela doit signifier , " said she , " qu 'il y aura la dedans un cadeau pour moi , et peut-etre pour vous aussi , mademoiselle .
monsieur a parle de vous : il m 'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante , et si elle n 'etait pas une petite personne , assez mince et un peu pale .
j 'ai dit qu 'oui : car c 'est vrai , n 'est-ce pas , mademoiselle ? "
i and my pupil dined as usual in mrs. fairfax 's parlour ; the afternoon was wild and snowy , and we passed it in the schoolroom .
at dark i allowed adele to put away books and work , and to run downstairs ; for , from the comparative silence below , and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell , i conjectured that mr. rochester was now at liberty .
left alone , i walked to the window ; but nothing was to be seen thence : twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air , and hid the very shrubs on the lawn .
i let down the curtain and went back to the fireside .
in the clear embers i was tracing a view , not unlike a picture i remembered to have seen of the castle of heidelberg , on the rhine , when mrs. fairfax came in , breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic i had been piercing together , and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude .
" mr. rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening , " said she : " he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before . "
" when is his tea-time ? " i inquired .
" oh , at six o 'clock : he keeps early hours in the country .
you had better change your frock now ; i will go with you and fasten it .
here is a candle . "
" is it necessary to change my frock ? "
" yes , you had better : i always dress for the evening when mr. rochester is here . "
this additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately ; however , i repaired to my room , and , with mrs. fairfax 's aid , replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk ; the best and the only additional one i had , except one of light grey , which , in my lowood notions of the toilette , i thought too fine to be worn , except on first-rate occasions .
" you want a brooch , " said mrs. fairfax .
i had a single little pearl ornament which miss temple gave me as a parting keepsake : i put it on , and then we went downstairs .
unused as i was to strangers , it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in mr. rochester 's presence .
i let mrs. fairfax precede me into the dining-room , and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and , passing the arch , whose curtain was now dropped , entered the elegant recess beyond .
two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay pilot--adele knelt near him .
half reclined on a couch appeared mr. rochester , his foot supported by the cushion ; he was looking at adele and the dog : the fire shone full on his face .
i knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows ; his square forehead , made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair .
i recognised his decisive nose , more remarkable for character than beauty ; his full nostrils , denoting , i thought , choler ; his grim mouth , chin , and jaw--yes , all three were very grim , and no mistake .
his shape , now divested of cloak , i perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy : i suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked , though neither tall nor graceful .
mr. rochester must have been aware of the entrance of mrs. fairfax and myself ; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us , for he never lifted his head as we approached .
" here is miss eyre , sir , " said mrs. fairfax , in her quiet way .
he bowed , still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child .
" let miss eyre be seated , " said he : and there was something in the forced stiff bow , in the impatient yet formal tone , which seemed further to express , " what the deuce is it to me whether miss eyre be there or not ? at this moment i am not disposed to accost her . "
i sat down quite disembarrassed .
a reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me : i could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part ; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation ; on the contrary , a decent quiescence , under the freak of manner , gave me the advantage .
besides , the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant : i felt interested to see how he would go on .
he went on as a statue would , that is , he neither spoke nor moved .
mrs. fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable , and she began to talk . kindly , as usual--and , as usual , rather trite--she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day ; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain : then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it .
" madam , i should like some tea , " was the sole rejoinder she got .
she hastened to ring the bell ; and when the tray came , she proceeded to arrange the cups , spoons , & c . , with assiduous celerity .
i and adele went to the table ; but the master did not leave his couch .
" will you hand mr. rochester 's cup ? " said mrs. fairfax to me ; " adele might perhaps spill it . "
i did as requested .
as he took the cup from my hand , adele , thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour , cried out--
" n 'est-ce pas , monsieur , qu 'il y a un cadeau pour mademoiselle eyre dans votre petit coffre ? "
" who talks of cadeaux ? " said he gruffly . " did you expect a present , miss eyre ?
are you fond of presents ? " and he searched my face with eyes that i saw were dark , irate , and piercing .
" i hardly know , sir ; i have little experience of them : they are generally thought pleasant things . "
" generally thought ? but what do _ you _ think ? "
" i should be obliged to take time , sir , before i could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance : a present has many faces to it , has it not ? and one should consider all , before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature . "
" miss eyre , you are not so unsophisticated as adele : she demands a ' cadeau , ' clamorously , the moment she sees me : you beat about the bush . "
" because i have less confidence in my deserts than adele has : she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance , and the right too of custom ; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings ; but if i had to make out a case i should be puzzled , since i am a stranger , and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment . "
" oh , don 't fall back on over-modesty ! i have examined adele , and find you have taken great pains with her : she is not bright , she has no talents ; yet in a short time she has made much improvement . "
" sir , you have now given me my ' cadeau ; ' i am obliged to you : it is the meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils ' progress . "
" humph ! " said mr. rochester , and he took his tea in silence .
" come to the fire , " said the master , when the tray was taken away , and mrs. fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting ; while adele was leading me by the hand round the room , showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres .
we obeyed , as in duty bound ; adele wanted to take a seat on my knee , but she was ordered to amuse herself with pilot .
" you have been resident in my house three months ? "
" yes , sir . "
" and you came from-- ? " " from lowood school , in ---shire . "
" ah ! a charitable concern .
how long were you there ? "
" eight years . "
" eight years ! you must be tenacious of life . i thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution !
no wonder you have rather the look of another world . i marvelled where you had got that sort of face .
when you came on me in hay lane last night , i thought unaccountably of fairy tales , and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse : i am not sure yet .
who are your parents ? "
" i have none . " " nor ever had , i suppose : do you remember them ? "
" no . "
" i thought not .
and so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile ? "
" for whom , sir ? "
" for the men in green : it was a proper moonlight evening for them .
did i break through one of your rings , that you spread that damned ice on the causeway ? "
i shook my head .
" the men in green all forsook england a hundred years ago , " said i , speaking as seriously as he had done .
" and not even in hay lane , or the fields about it , could you find a trace of them .
i don 't think either summer or harvest , or winter moon , will ever shine on their revels more . "
mrs. fairfax had dropped her knitting , and , with raised eyebrows , seemed wondering what sort of talk this was .
" well , " resumed mr. rochester , " if you disown parents , you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ? "
" no ; none that i ever saw . " " and your home ? " " i have none . "
" where do your brothers and sisters live ? " " i have no brothers or sisters . "
" who recommended you to come here ? "
" i advertised , and mrs. fairfax answered my advertisement . "
" yes , " said the good lady , who now knew what ground we were upon , " and i am daily thankful for the choice providence led me to make .
miss eyre has been an invaluable companion to me , and a kind and careful teacher to adele . "
" don 't trouble yourself to give her a character , " returned mr. rochester : " eulogiums will not bias me ; i shall judge for myself .
she began by felling my horse . "
" sir ? " said mrs. fairfax .
" i have to thank her for this sprain . "
the widow looked bewildered .
" miss eyre , have you ever lived in a town ? "
" no , sir . "
" have you seen much society ? " " none but the pupils and teachers of lowood , and now the inmates of thornfield . "
" have you read much ? " " only such books as came in my way ; and they have not been numerous or very learned . "
" you have lived the life of a nun : no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms ; --brocklehurst , who i understand directs lowood , is a parson , is he not ? "
" yes , sir . "
" and you girls probably worshipped him , as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director . "
" oh , no . "
" you are very cool ! no !
what ! a novice not worship her priest !
that sounds blasphemous . "
" i disliked mr. brocklehurst ; and i was not alone in the feeling .
he is a harsh man ; at once pompous and meddling ; he cut off our hair ; and for economy 's sake bought us bad needles and thread , with which we could hardly sew . "
" that was very false economy , " remarked mrs. fairfax , who now again caught the drift of the dialogue .
" and was that the head and front of his offending ? " demanded mr. rochester .
" he starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department , before the committee was appointed ; and he bored us with long lectures once a week , and with evening readings from books of his own inditing , about sudden deaths and judgments , which made us afraid to go to bed . "
" what age were you when you went to lowood ? "
" about ten . " " and you stayed there eight years : you are now , then , eighteen ? "
i assented .
" arithmetic , you see , is useful ; without its aid , i should hardly have been able to guess your age .
it is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case .
and now what did you learn at lowood ? can you play ? "
" a little . "
" of course : that is the established answer .
go into the library--i mean , if you please.-- ( excuse my tone of command ; i am used to say , ' do this , ' and it is done : i cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate . ) --go , then , into the library ; take a candle with you ; leave the door open ; sit down to the piano , and play a tune . "
i departed , obeying his directions .
" enough ! " he called out in a few minutes . " you play _ a little _ , i see ; like any other english school-girl ; perhaps rather better than some , but not well . "
i closed the piano and returned .
mr. rochester continued-- " adele showed me some sketches this morning , which she said were yours . i don 't know whether they were entirely of your doing ; probably a master aided you ? "
" no , indeed ! " i interjected .
" ah ! that pricks pride . well , fetch me your portfolio , if you can vouch for its contents being original ; but don 't pass your word unless you are certain : i can recognise patchwork . "
" then i will say nothing , and you shall judge for yourself , sir . "
i brought the portfolio from the library .
" approach the table , " said he ; and i wheeled it to his couch .
adele and mrs. fairfax drew near to see the pictures .
" no crowding , " said mr. rochester : " take the drawings from my hand as i finish with them ; but don 't push your faces up to mine . "
he deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting . three he laid aside ; the others , when he had examined them , he swept from him .
" take them off to the other table , mrs. fairfax , " said he , " and look at them with adele ; --you " ( glancing at me ) " resume your seat , and answer my questions .
i perceive those pictures were done by one hand : was that hand yours ? "
" yes . "
" and when did you find time to do them ? they have taken much time , and some thought . "
" i did them in the last two vacations i spent at lowood , when i had no other occupation . "
" where did you get your copies ? " " out of my head . "
" that head i see now on your shoulders ? "
" yes , sir . "
" has it other furniture of the same kind within ? "
" i should think it may have : i should hope--better . "
he spread the pictures before him , and again surveyed them alternately .
while he is so occupied , i will tell you , reader , what they are : and first , i must premise that they are nothing wonderful .
the subjects had , indeed , risen vividly on my mind .
as i saw them with the spiritual eye , before i attempted to embody them , they were striking ; but my hand would not second my fancy , and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing i had conceived .
these pictures were in water-colours .
the first represented clouds low and livid , rolling over a swollen sea : all the distance was in eclipse ; so , too , was the foreground ; or rather , the nearest billows , for there was no land .
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . "
" and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
" i do indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .
" i told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
yet he knew to the contrary himself . he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
" but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? "
" oh , yes ! --that , that is the worst of all .
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . and when i returned home , the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight 's time .
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ?
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . that _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
that such a consequence as _ this _ could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts . "
" when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? "
" not the slightest . i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away .
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " * * * * *
it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . from elizabeth 's thoughts it was never absent . fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self-reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
they travelled as expeditiously as possible , and , sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day .
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ; and , when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her .
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .
" not yet , " replied jane . " but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well . "
" is my father in town ? "
" yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word . "
" and have you heard from him often ? "
" we have heard only twice .
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention . "
" and my mother--how is she ?
how are you all ? "
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .
mary and kitty , thank heaven , are quite well . "
" but you--how are you ? " cried elizabeth .
" you look pale .
how much you must have gone through ! "
her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party .
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ' conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing .
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point in going to brighton , with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after .
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was overruled , as i always am .
poor dear child !
and now here 's mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . "
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he ; " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .
in a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
" oh ! my dear brother , " replied mrs. bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for .
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry .
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married .
and , above all , keep mr. bennet from fighting .
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frighted out of my wits--and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me--such spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
oh , brother , how kind you are !
i know you will contrive it all . "
but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fear ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table , they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty .
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table :
" this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . " then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard .
give me further particulars .
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ?
they must have seen them together for ever . "
" colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . i am so grieved for him !
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .
he _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
" and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ?
had colonel forster seen denny himself ? "
" yes ; but , when questioned by _ him _ , denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it .
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _ that _ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "
" and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? "
" how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ?
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . my father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
" but not before they went to brighton ? "
" no , i believe not . "
" and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself ?
does he know his real character ? "
" i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "
" oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
" perhaps it would have been better , " replied her sister . " but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . we acted with the best intentions . "
" could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia 's note to his wife ? "
" he brought it with him for us to see . "
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .
these were the contents :
" my dear harriet ,
" you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them and sign my name ' lydia wickham . '
what a good joke it will be !
i can hardly write for laughing .
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . good-bye .
give my love to colonel forster . i hope you will drink to our good journey .
" your affectionate friend ,
" lydia bennet . "
" oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it .
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment !
but at least it shows that _ she _ was serious on the subject of their journey . whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy .
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! "
" i never saw anyone so shocked .
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
" oh !
jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
" i do not know .
i hope there was . but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult .
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . "
" your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
you do not look well .
oh that i had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
" mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure ; but i did not think it right for either of them . kitty is slight and delicate ; and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .
she was of great use and comfort to us all . and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . "
" she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one 's neighbours .
assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable .
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .
" he meant i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them .
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham . if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
chapter 48
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .
his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion .
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain .
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband 's not being killed in a duel .
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom .
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up--though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham 's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman 's family .
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister 's ruin more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday his wife received a letter from him ; it told them that , on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street ; that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon .
there was also a postscript to this effect : " i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself .
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .
at present we have nothing to guide us .
colonel forster will , i dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . but , on second thoughts , perhaps , lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved .
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .
the arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning 's impatience .
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . it was as follows :
" my dear sir ,
" i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind .
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ?
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .
let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
" i am , dear sir , etc . , etc . "
mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .
his former acquaintances had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .
there was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount .
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton .
he owed a good deal in town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family .
jane heard them with horror .
" a gamester ! " she cried .
" this is wholly unexpected .
i had not an idea of it . "
mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law 's entreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ? " she cried .
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them .
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and the children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world .
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley .
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that _ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia 's infamy somewhat better . it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
it was not till the afternoon , when he had joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that .
who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . "
" you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth .
" you may well warn me against such an evil .
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . it will pass away soon enough . "
" do you suppose them to be in london ? "
" yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
" and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty .
" she is happy then , " said her father drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
then after a short silence he continued :
" lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . "
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother 's tea .
" this is a parade , " he cried , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ; or , perhaps , i may defer it till kitty runs away . "
" i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty fretfully .
" if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . "
" _ you _ go to brighton . i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds !
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .
no officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village .
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . "
chapter 49
two days after mr. bennet 's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . "
" what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town . "
" dear madam , " cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , " don 't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?
he has been here this half-hour , and master has had a letter . "
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said :
" if you are looking for my master , ma 'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
jane , who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out :
" oh , papa , what news--what news ?
have you heard from my uncle ? "
" yes i have had a letter from him by express . "
" well , and what news does it bring--good or bad ? "
" what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket .
" but perhaps you would like to read it . "
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
jane now came up .
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about . "
" gracechurch street , monday , august 2 .
" my dear brother ,
" at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope it will give you satisfaction .
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were . the particulars i reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered .
" then it is as i always hoped , " cried jane ; " they are married ! " elizabeth read on :
" i have seen them both .
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .
these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .
send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .
she comes to us to-day .
i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . yours , etc . ,
" edw . gardiner . "
" is it possible ? " cried elizabeth , when she had finished .
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , " said her sister .
" my dear father , i congratulate you . "
" and have you answered the letter ? " cried elizabeth .
" no ; but it must be done soon . "
" oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back and write immediately . consider how important every moment is in such a case . "
" let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
" i dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .
" and may i ask-- " said elizabeth ; " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . "
" complied with !
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
" and they _ must _ marry !
yet he is _ such _ a man ! "
" yes , yes , they must marry .
there is nothing else to be done .
but there are two things that i want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am i ever to pay him . "
" money !
my uncle ! " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "
" i mean , that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . "
" that is very true , " said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !
oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings !
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .
a small sum could not do all this . "
" no , " said her father ; " wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
" ten thousand pounds !
heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .
their father then went on to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .
" and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . " how strange this is !
and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice .
oh , lydia ! "
" i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her .
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced .
he has children of his own , and may have more . how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
" if he were ever able to learn what wickham 's debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
" their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor anybody can ever forget .
it is useless to talk of it . "
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .
he was writing and , without raising his head , coolly replied :
" just as you please . "
" may we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
" take whatever you like , and get away . "
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table , and they went up stairs together .
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner 's hope of lydia 's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . to know that her daughter would be married was enough .
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
" my dear , dear lydia ! " she cried .
" this is delightful indeed ! she will be married !
i shall see her again !
she will be married at sixteen !
my good , kind brother !
i knew how it would be .
i knew he would manage everything !
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes !
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
stay , stay , i will go myself .
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .
i will put on my things in a moment .
my dear , dear lydia !
how merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under .
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure to his kindness .
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money . "
" well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents . well !
i am so happy ! in a short time i shall have a daughter married .
mrs. wickham !
how well it sounds !
and she was only sixteen last june .
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can 't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted .
one day 's delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
other schemes , too , came into her head .
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .
kitty , run down and order the carriage .
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .
girls , can i do anything for you in meryton ? oh !
here comes hill !
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . "
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .
poor lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
chapter 50
mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .
he now wished it more than ever .
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place .
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .
when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless , for , of course , they were to have a son .
the son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia 's birth , had been certain that he would .
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . this was one point , with regard to lydia , at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement .
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother 's hands , lydia 's expenses had been very little within that sum .
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
his letter was soon dispatched ; for , though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother , but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her .
the good news spread quickly through the house , and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .
to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farmhouse .
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband her misery was considered certain .
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings could quit it--or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for pulvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . but when they had withdrawn , he said to her : " mrs. bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .
into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance .
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . "
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm .
it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion .
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it . that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all she could believe possible .
she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place .
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means . there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of a sister 's frailty would have mortified her so much--not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself , for , at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .
had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where , to every other objection , would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned .
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . she was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been most gladly and gratefully received !
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex ; but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .
to mr. bennet 's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .
and i think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's .
it is mr. wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ---- ' s regiment , now quartered in the north .
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
he promises fairly ; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information ?
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south .
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--yours , etc . ,
" e. gardiner . "
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham 's removal from the ----shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .
but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it .
lydia 's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .
" she is so fond of mrs. forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away !
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ---- ' s regiment . "
his daughter 's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north .
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
chapter 51
their sister 's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it by dinner-time .
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets , and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
they came .
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them .
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
lydia 's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand , with an affectionate smile , to wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .
their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour .
there was no want of discourse .
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . "
her father lifted up his eyes . jane was distressed .
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day ?
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side-glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like anything . "
elizabeth could bear it no longer .
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . "
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .
her ease and good spirits increased .
she longed to see mrs. phillips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs. wickham " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to show her ring , and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ?
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .
i only hope they may have half my good luck . they must all go to brighton .
that is the place to get husbands . what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should . but my dear lydia , i don 't at all like your going such a way off .
must it be so ? "
" oh , lord ! yes ; --there is nothing in that .
i shall like it of all things .
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . "
" i should like it beyond anything ! " said her mother . " and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
" i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
wickham 's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him . she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth :
" lizzy , i never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , i believe . you were not by , when i told mamma and the others all about it .
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
" no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "
" la ! you are so strange !
but i must tell you how it went off .
we were married , you know , at st. clement 's , because wickham 's lodgings were in that parish .
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o 'clock . my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !
i was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . "
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
not one party , or scheme , or anything .
to be sure london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open . well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out .
however , i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . "
" mr. darcy ! " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .
" oh , yes ! --he was to come there with wickham , you know . but gracious me !
i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it .
i promised them so faithfully !
what will wickham say ?
it was to be such a secret ! "
" if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject . you may depend upon my seeking no further . "
" oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "
" thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . "
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
pray write instantly , and let me understand it--unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
" not that i _ shall _ , though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; --till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
chapter 52
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could .
she was no sooner in possession of it than , hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
" gracechurch street , sept . 6 .
" my dear niece ,
" i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _ you _ .
don 't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side .
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done .
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
" on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been .
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; wickham repeatedly , lydia once . from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world .
his character was to speak for itself . he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself .
if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
" there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town .
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction . they were in ---- street .
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . she cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham .
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design .
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia 's flight on her own folly alone .
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
" mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country .
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
" they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
" every thing being settled between _ them _ , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former .
he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
" on saturday he came again . your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
" they met again on sunday , and then _ i _ saw him too .
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
but our visitor was very obstinate .
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . he has been accused of many faults at different times , but _ this _ is the true one .
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
" they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
" you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased .
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody 's _ reserve , can be answerable for the event .
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair .
" when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
" i believe i have now told you every thing . it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . _ he _ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain .
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
" mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . i thought him very sly ; --he hardly ever mentioned your name .
but slyness seems the fashion . " pray forgive me if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .
" but i must write no more . the children have been wanting me this half hour .
" yours , very sincerely ,
" m. gardiner . "
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her . but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her--for a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
brother-in-law of wickham !
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
he had , to be sure , done much .
she was ashamed to think how much . but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing , to him .
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . she read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again .
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one 's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her .
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .
we were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
" true . are the others coming out ? "
" i do not know .
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .
and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . "
she replied in the affirmative .
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .
but of course she did not mention my name to you . "
" yes , she did . "
" and what did she say ? "
" that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had--not turned out well .
at such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said :
" i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .
we passed each other several times .
i wonder what he can be doing there . "
" perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth .
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "
" undoubtedly .
did you see him while you were at lambton ?
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . "
" yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
" and do you like her ? "
" very much . "
" i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .
i am very glad you liked her .
i hope she will turn out well . "
" i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
" did you go by the village of kympton ? "
" i do not recollect that we did . "
" i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .
a most delightful place ! --excellent parsonage house !
it would have suited me in every respect . "
" how should you have liked making sermons ? "
" exceedingly well .
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .
one ought not to repine ; --but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness !
but it was not to be .
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? "
" i have heard from authority , which i thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
" you have . yes , there was something in _ that _ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "
" i _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
" you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation .
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sister 's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile :
" come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .
do not let us quarrel about the past .
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . "
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .
chapter 53
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
" oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "
" oh , lord ! i don 't know .
not these two or three years , perhaps . "
" write to me very often , my dear . "
" as often as i can .
but you know married women have never much time for writing .
my sisters may write to _ me _ . they will have nothing else to do . "
mr. wickham 's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 's . he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw .
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
i am prodigiously proud of him . i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law . "
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .
" this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .
she looked at jane , and smiled and shook her head by turns .
" well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs. phillips first brought her the news ) .
" well , so much the better .
not that i care about it , though .
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _ i _ never want to see him again .
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .
and who knows what _ may _ happen ? but that is nothing to us .
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "
" you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .
she was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . "
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said :
" i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed . but don 't imagine it was from any silly cause .
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _ should _ be looked at .
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .
not that i am afraid of _ myself _ , but i dread other people 's remarks . "
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .
" as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs. bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "
" no , no .
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .
" ' tis an etiquette i despise , " said he . " if he wants our society , let him seek it .
he knows where we live . i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . "
" well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
but , however , that shan 't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did . as the day of his arrival drew near , -- " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister .
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much i suffer from what she says .
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! "
mr. bingley arrived .
mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could .
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house .
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window--she looked , --she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; " who can it be ? "
" la ! " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . mr. what 's-his-name . that tall , proud man . "
" good gracious !
mr. darcy ! --and so it does , i vow .
well , any friend of mr. bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
both sisters were uncomfortable enough . each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley 's friend , without being heard by either of them .
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley .
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .
but she would not be secure .
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance .
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .
he looked serious , as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .
but , perhaps he could not in her mother 's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .
darcy , after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything .
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed .
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she .
" yet why did he come ? "
" it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away , " said mrs. bennet .
he readily agreed to it . " i began to be afraid you would never come back again .
people _ did _ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .
miss lucas is married and settled . and one of my own daughters .
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq. to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
it was my brother gardiner 's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
did you see it ? "
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay i do not know how long .
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .
thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
a few weeks , he believed .
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennet 's manor .
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
elizabeth 's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
at that instant , she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . they then went away .
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
chapter 54
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
mr. darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her .
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . " he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?
if he fears me , why come hither ?
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?
teasing , teasing , man !
i will think no more about him . "
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which showed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .
i am glad he dines here on tuesday . it will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .
" oh , jane , take care . "
" my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? "
" i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived .
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .
he placed himself by her . elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane 's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them .
he was on one side of her mother . she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did .
her mother 's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth 's mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil .
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . " if he does not come to me , _ then _ , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever . "
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair .
and on the gentlemen 's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper :
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying :
" is your sister at pemberley still ? "
" yes , she will remain there till christmas . "
" and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? "
" mrs. annesley is with her . the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks . "
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .
when the tea-things were removed , and the card-tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .
she now lost every expectation of pleasure . they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch .
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases ' last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .
mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .
and what do you think she said besides ?
'ah !
mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last . '
she did indeed .
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . "
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth .
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .
i hope we may often meet again . "
elizabeth smiled .
" lizzy , you must not do so .
you must not suspect me . it mortifies me .
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .
i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . "
" you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
" but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "
chapter 55
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky . "
he should be particularly happy at any time , etc. etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
" can you come to-morrow ? "
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
he came , and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed .
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter 's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out :
" my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .
he is come--mr .
bingley is come .
he is , indeed .
make haste , make haste .
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . never mind miss lizzy 's hair . "
" we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "
" oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick !
where is your sash , my dear ? "
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening .
after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?
what do you keep winking at me for ?
what am i to do ? "
" nothing child , nothing .
i did not wink at you . "
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it .
in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half-opened the door and called out :
" lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "
elizabeth was forced to go .
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother , as soon as she was in the hall .
" kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room . "
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .
mrs. bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual .
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet 's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time . seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence .
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennet 's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes .
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all . their situation was awkward enough ; but _ hers _ she thought was still worse .
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
" ' tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much .
i do not deserve it .
oh ! why is not everybody as happy ? "
elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said for the present .
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself .
he is gone to my father already .
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! "
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
" where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door .
" with my mother up stairs . she will be down in a moment , i dare say . "
he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of jane 's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet 's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .
mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter , and said :
" jane , i congratulate you .
you will be a very happy woman . "
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
" you are a good girl ; " he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
your tempers are by no means unlike .
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
" i hope not so .
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . "
" exceed their income ! my dear mr. bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?
why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . " then addressing her daughter , " oh ! my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !
i am sure i shan 't get a wink of sleep all night . i knew how it would be .
i always said it must be so , at last . i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept .
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
i had not believed it possible . "
" i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth .
" but how did he account for it ? "
" it must have been his sister 's doing . they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter .
good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley 's pretended regard . "
" would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ! "
" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane . " oh !
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !
if i could but see _ you _ as happy !
if there _ were _ but such another man for you ! "
" if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time . "
chapter 56
one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered . it was lady catherine de bourgh .
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth 's salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship 's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .
mrs. bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,
" i hope you are well , miss bennet .
that lady , i suppose , is your mother . "
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .
" and _ that _ i suppose is one of your sisters . "
" yes , madam , " said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to lady catherine .
" she is my youngest girl but one .
my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family . "
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence .
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas 's . "
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner , and then added :
" may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well . "
" yes , very well .
i saw them the night before last . "
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth ,
" miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
" go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and show her ladyship about the different walks .
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs .
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face .
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : --
" you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . "
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam . i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .
but however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so .
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago .
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy .
though i _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . "
" if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .
what could your ladyship propose by it ? "
" at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
" your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
" if !
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
" i never heard that it was . "
" and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "
" i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer . "
" this is not to be borne .
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
" it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .
you may have drawn him in . "
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "
" miss bennet , do you know who i am ?
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
" but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "
" let me be rightly understood .
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .
no , never .
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .
now what have you to say ? "
" only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied :
" the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .
it was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers .
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
" yes , and i had heard it before .
but what is that to me ?
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . its completion depended on others .
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? "
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
" these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth . " but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
" obstinate , headstrong girl !
i am ashamed of you !
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
is nothing due to me on that score ?
let us sit down .
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .
i have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
" _ that _ will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "
" i will not be interrupted . hear me in silence .
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient--though untitled--families .
their fortune on both sides is splendid .
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . is this to be endured !
but it must not , shall not be .
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . "
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
" true . you _ are _ a gentleman 's daughter .
but who was your mother ?
who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
" whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . "
" tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment 's deliberation :
" i am not . "
lady catherine seemed pleased .
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
" i will make no promise of the kind . "
" miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require . "
" and i certainly _ never _ shall give it .
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable ?
supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
" not so hasty , if you please .
i have by no means done .
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement .
i know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .
and is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ?
is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ?
heaven and earth ! --of what are you thinking ?
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
" you can now have nothing further to say , " she resentfully answered .
" you have insulted me in every possible method .
i must beg to return to the house . "
and she rose as she spoke .
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .
her ladyship was highly incensed .
" it is well .
you refuse , then , to oblige me .
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
" and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well . i shall now know how to act . do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . i came to try you . i hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , i will carry my point . "
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet . i send no compliments to your mother .
you deserve no such attention .
i am most seriously displeased . "
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "
" she is a very fine-looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? "
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
chapter 57
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
lady catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
it was a rational scheme , to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine ) , had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _ he _ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
in that case he would return no more .
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it . i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
the next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
he then said ,
" i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued :
" you look conscious . young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _ your _ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
this letter is from mr. collins . "
" from mr. collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? "
" something very much to the purpose of course .
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
what relates to yourself , is as follows : ' having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . '
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " ' this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , --splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ' " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out :
" ' my motive for cautioning you is as follows . we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ' " _ mr. darcy _ , you see , is the man !
now , lizzy , i think i _ have _ surprised you .
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
it is admirable ! "
elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
" are you not diverted ? "
" oh ! yes .
pray read on . "
" ' after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . '
mr. collins moreover adds , ' i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
you ought certainly to forgive them , as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . '
that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
you are not going to be _ missish _ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
" oh ! " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted . but it is so strange ! "
" yes-- _ that _ is what makes it amusing .
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
did she call to refuse her consent ? "
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
chapter 58
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
it was agreed to .
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking ; mary could never spare time ; but the remaining five set off together .
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other .
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said :
" mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding yours .
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
" i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
" you must not blame my aunt .
lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
" if you _ will _ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . but your _ family _ owe me nothing .
much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of _ you _ . "
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
after a short pause , her companion added ,
" you are too generous to trifle with me .
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . _ my _ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
they walked on , without knowing in what direction . there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give .
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . "
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of _ that _ .
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . it was unpardonable .
" we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth .
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . "
" i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' those were your words .
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; --though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
" i can easily believe it . you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
" oh ! do not repeat what i then said .
these recollections will not do at all . i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
darcy mentioned his letter . " did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ?
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
" when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
" the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . the adieu is charity itself .
but think no more of the letter . the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten .
you must learn some of my philosophy . think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
" i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
but with me , it is not so . painful recollections will intrude which cannot , which ought not , to be repelled .
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper .
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , i was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !
what do i not owe you !
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
by you , i was properly humbled .
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
" my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you . i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . how you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ? "
" hate you !
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at pemberley .
you blamed me for coming ? "
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise . "
" your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you .
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . "
" my object then , " replied darcy , " was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . "
he then told her of georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .
" what could become of mr. bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth .
" not at all .
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "
" that is to say , you had given your permission .
i guessed as much . "
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he , " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
his surprise was great .
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . " elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
" and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
" it did .
bingley is most unaffectedly modest . his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy .
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . he was angry .
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . he has heartily forgiven me now . "
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin .
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
in the hall they parted .
chapter 59
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary .
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
at night she opened her heart to jane .
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
" you are joking , lizzy .
this cannot be ! --engaged to mr. darcy !
no , no , you shall not deceive me . i know it to be impossible . "
" this is a wretched beginning indeed !
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . yet , indeed , i am in earnest .
i speak nothing but the truth . he still loves me , and we are engaged . "
jane looked at her doubtingly .
" oh , lizzy ! it cannot be . i know how much you dislike him . "
" you know nothing of the matter . _ that _ is all to be forgot .
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now . but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . "
miss bennet still looked all amazement .
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
" good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain ? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
" there can be no doubt of that .
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
but are you pleased , jane ?
shall you like to have such a brother ? "
" very , very much .
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
and do you really love him quite well enough ?
oh , lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
" oh , yes ! you will only think i feel _ more _ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "
" what do you mean ? "
" why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley .
i am afraid you will be angry . "
" my dearest sister , now _ be _ serious .
i want to talk very seriously .
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
" it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . "
another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish .
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .
i always had a value for him .
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it to another , not to you . "
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia 's marriage .
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
" good gracious ! " cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
i had no notion but he would go a-shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
what shall we do with him ?
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . "
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mrs. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? "
" i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs. bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . "
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr. bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . won 't it , kitty ? "
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying :
" i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her means--that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
she was gone directly .
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . " lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
have not you always hated him ? "
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
" or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
but will they make you happy ? "
" have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "
" none at all .
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
" i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .
indeed he has no improper pride . he is perfectly amiable .
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent .
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
i now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . but let me advise you to think better of it .
i know your disposition , lizzy .
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life .
you know not what you are about . "
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ' suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say . if this be the case , he deserves you .
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
he heard her with astonishment .
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
so much the better . it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go--saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . "
elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
" good gracious !
lord bless me ! only think ! dear me !
mr. darcy !
who would have thought it !
and is it really true ?
oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be !
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !
jane 's is nothing to it--nothing at all .
i am so pleased--so happy .
such a charming man ! --so handsome ! so tall ! --oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . i hope he will overlook it .
dear , dear lizzy .
a house in town !
every thing that is charming !
three daughters married ! ten thousand a year !
oh , lord ! what will become of me .
i shall go distracted . "
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else !
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !
'tis as good as a lord !
and a special licence .
you must and shall be married by a special licence . but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . "
this was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
" i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , " said he .
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as jane 's . "
chapter 60
elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
" how could you begin ? " said she . " i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
it is too long ago .
i was in the middle before i knew that i _ had _ begun . "
" my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners--my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
" for the liveliness of your mind , i did . "
" you may as well call it impertinence at once . it was very little less .
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone .
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _ them _ . had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . "
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield ? "
" dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ?
but make a virtue of it by all means .
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
" because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
" but i was embarrassed . "
" and so was i. "
" you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
" a man who had felt less , might . "
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
but i wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . i wonder when you _ would _ have spoken , if i had not asked you !
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . _ too much _ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? for i ought not to have mentioned the subject . this will never do . "
" you need not distress yourself . the moral will be perfectly fair .
lady catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours . my aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing . "
" lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
" i am more likely to want more time than courage , elizabeth . but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
" and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner 's long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows :
" i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .
you supposed more than really existed .
but _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
your idea of the ponies is delightful . we will go round the park every day .
i am the happiest creature in the world .
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me .
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .
yours , etc . "
mr. darcy 's letter to lady catherine was in a different style ; and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .
" dear sir ,
" i must trouble you once more for congratulations . elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .
console lady catherine as well as you can .
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . he has more to give .
" yours sincerely , etc . "
miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother 's in sending it . four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
he bore it , however , with admirable calmness . he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. james 's , with very decent composure .
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
mrs. phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .
chapter 61
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed .
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
from the further disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone .
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . the letter was to this effect :
" my dear lizzy ,
" i wish you joy .
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .
" yours , etc . "
as it happened that elizabeth had _ much _ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .
pemberley was now georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . they were able to love each other even as well as they intended .
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
by elizabeth 's instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
but at length , by elizabeth 's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .

chapter i
there was no possibility of taking a walk that day .
we had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( mrs. reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out-door exercise was now out of the question .
i was glad of it : i never liked long walks , especially on chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight , with nipped fingers and toes , and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie , the nurse , and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza , john , and georgiana reed .
the said eliza , john , and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room : she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside , and with her darlings about her ( for the time neither quarrelling nor crying ) looked perfectly happy .
me , she had dispensed from joining the group ; saying , " she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children . "
" what does bessie say i have done ? " i asked .
" jane , i don 't like cavillers or questioners ; besides , there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner .
be seated somewhere ; and until you can speak pleasantly , remain silent . "
a breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room , i slipped in there .
it contained a bookcase : i soon possessed myself of a volume , taking care that it should be one stored with pictures .
i mounted into the window- seat : gathering up my feet , i sat cross-legged , like a turk ; and , having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close , i was shrined in double retirement .
folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand ; to the left were the clear panes of glass , protecting , but not separating me from the drear november day .
at intervals , while turning over the leaves of my book , i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon .
afar , it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud ; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub , with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast .
i returned to my book--bewick 's history of british birds : the letterpress thereof i cared little for , generally speaking ; and yet there were certain introductory pages that , child as i was , i could not pass quite as a blank .
they were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl ; of " the solitary rocks and promontories " by them only inhabited ; of the coast of norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the lindeness , or naze , to the north cape-- " where the northern ocean , in vast whirls , boils round the naked , melancholy isles of farthest thule ; and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides . "
nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of lapland , siberia , spitzbergen , nova zembla , iceland , greenland , with " the vast sweep of the arctic zone , and those forlorn regions of dreary space , --that reservoir of frost and snow , where firm fields of ice , the accumulation of centuries of winters , glazed in alpine heights above heights , surround the pole , and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold . "
of these death-white realms i formed an idea of my own : shadowy , like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children 's brains , but strangely impressive .
the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .
each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up mrs. reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period i discovered ) from the pages of pamela , and henry , earl of moreland .
with bewick on my knee , i was then happy : happy at least in my way . i feared nothing but interruption , and that came too soon .
the breakfast- room door opened .
" boh ! madam mope ! " cried the voice of john reed ; then he paused : he found the room apparently empty .
" where the dickens is she ! " he continued .
" lizzy ! georgy ! ( calling to his sisters ) joan is not here : tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad animal ! "
" it is well i drew the curtain , " thought i ; and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would john reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once--
" she is in the window-seat , to be sure , jack . "
and i came out immediately , for i trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said jack .
" what do you want ? " i asked , with awkward diffidence .
" say , ' what do you want , master reed ? ' " was the answer .
" i want you to come here ; " and seating himself in an arm-chair , he intimated by a gesture that i was to approach and stand before him .
john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than i , for i was but ten : large and stout for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .
he gorged himself habitually at table , which made him bilious , and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks .
he ought now to have been at school ; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two , " on account of his delicate health . "
mr. miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned from an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that john 's sallowness was owing to over-application and , perhaps , to pining after home .
john had not much affection for his mother and sisters , and an antipathy to me .
he bullied and punished me ; not two or three times in the week , nor once or twice in the day , but continually : every nerve i had feared him , and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near .
there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and mrs. reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .
habitually obedient to john , i came up to his chair : he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots : i knew he would soon strike , and while dreading the blow , i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it .
i wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , all at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly .
i tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair .
" that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since , " said he , " and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains , and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since , you rat ! "
accustomed to john reed 's abuse , i never had an idea of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult .
" what were you doing behind the curtain ? " he asked .
" i was reading . "
" show the book . "
i returned to the window and fetched it thence .
" you have no business to take our books ; you are a dependent , mama says ; you have no money ; your father left you none ; you ought to beg , and not to live here with gentlemen 's children like us , and eat the same meals we do , and wear clothes at our mama 's expense .
now , i 'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves : for they _ are _ mine ; all the house belongs to me , or will do in a few years . go and stand by the door , out of the way of the mirror and the windows . "
i did so , not at first aware what was his intention ; but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it , i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm : not soon enough , however ; the volume was flung , it hit me , and i fell , striking my head against the door and cutting it .
the cut bled , the pain was sharp : my terror had passed its climax ; other feelings succeeded .
" wicked and cruel boy ! " i said . " you are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the roman emperors ! "
i had read goldsmith 's history of rome , and had formed my opinion of nero , caligula , & c . also i had drawn parallels in silence , which i never thought thus to have declared aloud .
" what ! what ! " he cried . " did she say that to me ? did you hear her , eliza and georgiana ?
won 't i tell mama ? but first-- " he ran headlong at me : i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder : he had closed with a desperate thing .
i really saw in him a tyrant , a murderer . i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck , and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering : these sensations for the time predominated over fear , and i received him in frantic sort .
aid was near him : eliza and georgiana had run for mrs. reed , who was gone upstairs : she now came upon the scene , followed by bessie and her maid abbot .
we were parted : i heard the words-- " dear ! dear ! what a fury to fly at master john ! "
" did ever anybody see such a picture of passion ! "
then mrs. reed subjoined--
" take her away to the red-room , and lock her in there . "
four hands were immediately laid upon me , and i was borne upstairs .
chapter ii
i resisted all the way : a new thing for me , and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me .
the fact is , i was a trifle beside myself ; or rather _ out _ of myself , as the french would say : i was conscious that a moment 's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties , and , like any other rebel slave , i felt resolved , in my desperation , to go all lengths .
" hold her arms , miss abbot : she 's like a mad cat . "
" for shame ! for shame ! " cried the lady 's-maid .
" what shocking conduct , miss eyre , to strike a young gentleman , your benefactress 's son !
your young master . "
" master !
how is he my master ?
am i a servant ? "
" no ; you are less than a servant , for you do nothing for your keep .
there , sit down , and think over your wickedness . "
they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs. reed , and had thrust me upon a stool : my impulse was to rise from it like a spring ; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly .
" if you don 't sit still , you must be tied down , " said bessie .
" miss abbot , lend me your garters ; she would break mine directly . "
miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature .
this preparation for bonds , and the additional ignominy it inferred , took a little of the excitement out of me .
" don 't take them off , " i cried ; " i will not stir . "
in guarantee whereof , i attached myself to my seat by my hands .
" mind you don 't , " said bessie ; and when she had ascertained that i was really subsiding , she loosened her hold of me ; then she and miss abbot stood with folded arms , looking darkly and doubtfully on my face , as incredulous of my sanity .
" she never did so before , " at last said bessie , turning to the abigail .
" but it was always in her , " was the reply . " i 've told missis often my opinion about the child , and missis agreed with me . she 's an underhand little thing : i never saw a girl of her age with so much cover . "
bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said-- " you ought to be aware , miss , that you are under obligations to mrs. reed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you off , you would have to go to the poorhouse . "
i had nothing to say to these words : they were not new to me : my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind .
this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear : very painful and crushing , but only half intelligible .
miss abbot joined in-- " and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed , because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them .
they will have a great deal of money , and you will have none : it is your place to be humble , and to try to make yourself agreeable to them . "
" what we tell you is for your good , " added bessie , in no harsh voice , " you should try to be useful and pleasant , then , perhaps , you would have a home here ; but if you become passionate and rude , missis will send you away , i am sure . "
" besides , " said miss abbot , " god will punish her : he might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums , and then where would she go ?
come , bessie , we will leave her : i wouldn 't have her heart for anything .
say your prayers , miss eyre , when you are by yourself ; for if you don 't repent , something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away . "
they went , shutting the door , and locking it behind them .
the red-room was a square chamber , very seldom slept in , i might say never , indeed , unless when a chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained : yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion .
a bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany , hung with curtains of deep red damask , stood out like a tabernacle in the centre ; the two large windows , with their blinds always drawn down , were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery ; the carpet was red ; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth ; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it ; the wardrobe , the toilet-table , the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany .
out of these deep surrounding shades rose high , and glared white , the piled- up mattresses and pillows of the bed , spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane .
scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed , also white , with a footstool before it ; and looking , as i thought , like a pale throne .
this room was chill , because it seldom had a fire ; it was silent , because remote from the nursery and kitchen ; solemn , because it was known to be so seldom entered .
the house-maid alone came here on saturdays , to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week 's quiet dust : and mrs. reed herself , at far intervals , visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe , where were stored divers parchments , her jewel-casket , and a miniature of her deceased husband ; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur .
mr. reed had been dead nine years : it was in this chamber he breathed his last ; here he lay in state ; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker 's men ; and , since that day , a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion .
my seat , to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left me riveted , was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece ; the bed rose before me ; to my right hand there was the high , dark wardrobe , with subdued , broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels ; to my left were the muffled windows ; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room .
i was not quite sure whether they had locked the door ; and when i dared move , i got up and went to see .
alas ! yes : no jail was ever more secure .
returning , i had to cross before the looking- glass ; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed .
all looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality : and the strange little figure there gazing at me , with a white face and arms specking the gloom , and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still , had the effect of a real spirit : i thought it like one of the tiny phantoms , half fairy , half imp , bessie 's evening stories represented as coming out of lone , ferny dells in moors , and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers . i returned to my stool .
superstition was with me at that moment ; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory : my blood was still warm ; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour ; i had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to the dismal present .
all john reed 's violent tyrannies , all his sisters ' proud indifference , all his mother 's aversion , all the servants ' partiality , turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well .
why was i always suffering , always browbeaten , always accused , for ever condemned ?
why could i never please ?
why was it useless to try to win any one 's favour ?
eliza , who was headstrong and selfish , was respected . georgiana , who had a spoiled temper , a very acrid spite , a captious and insolent carriage , was universally indulged . her beauty , her pink cheeks and golden curls , seemed to give delight to all who looked at her , and to purchase indemnity for every fault .
john no one thwarted , much less punished ; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons , killed the little pea-chicks , set the dogs at the sheep , stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit , and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory : he called his mother " old girl , " too ; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin , similar to his own ; bluntly disregarded her wishes ; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire ; and he was still " her own darling . "
i dared commit no fault : i strove to fulfil every duty ; and i was termed naughty and tiresome , sullen and sneaking , from morning to noon , and from noon to night .
my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received : no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me ; and because i had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence , i was loaded with general opprobrium .
" unjust ! --unjust ! " said my reason , forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power : and resolve , equally wrought up , instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away , or , if that could not be effected , never eating or drinking more , and letting myself die .
what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon ! how all my brain was in tumult , and all my heart in insurrection !
yet in what darkness , what dense ignorance , was the mental battle fought ! i could not answer the ceaseless inward question-- _ why _ i thus suffered ; now , at the distance of--i will not say how many years , i see it clearly .
i was a discord in gateshead hall : i was like nobody there ; i had nothing in harmony with mrs. reed or her children , or her chosen vassalage .
if they did not love me , in fact , as little did i love them .
they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them ; a heterogeneous thing , opposed to them in temperament , in capacity , in propensities ; a useless thing , incapable of serving their interest , or adding to their pleasure ; a noxious thing , cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment , of contempt of their judgment .
i know that had i been a sanguine , brilliant , careless , exacting , handsome , romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--mrs .
reed would have endured my presence more complacently ; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling ; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery .
daylight began to forsake the red-room ; it was past four o 'clock , and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight . i heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window , and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall ; i grew by degrees cold as a stone , and then my courage sank .
my habitual mood of humiliation , self-doubt , forlorn depression , fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire .
all said i was wicked , and perhaps i might be so ; what thought had i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death ?
that certainly was a crime : and was i fit to die ? or was the vault under the chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne ?
in such vault i had been told did mr. reed lie buried ; and led by this thought to recall his idea , i dwelt on it with gathering dread .
i could not remember him ; but i knew that he was my own uncle--my mother 's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house ; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs. reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children .
mrs. reed probably considered she had kept this promise ; and so she had , i dare say , as well as her nature would permit her ; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race , and unconnected with her , after her husband 's death , by any tie ?
it must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love , and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group .
a singular notion dawned upon me . i doubted not--never doubted--that if mr. reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly ; and now , as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--i began to recall what i had heard of dead men , troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes , revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed ; and i thought mr. reed 's spirit , harassed by the wrongs of his sister 's child , might quit its abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed--and rise before me in this chamber .
i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs , fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me , or elicit from the gloom some haloed face , bending over me with strange pity .
this idea , consolatory in theory , i felt would be terrible if realised : with all my might i endeavoured to stifle it--i endeavoured to be firm .
shaking my hair from my eyes , i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .
was it , i asked myself , a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?
no ; moonlight was still , and this stirred ; while i gazed , it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head .
i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .
steps came running along the outer passage ; the key turned , bessie and abbot entered .
" miss eyre , are you ill ? " said bessie .
" what a dreadful noise ! it went quite through me ! " exclaimed abbot .
" take me out ! let me go into the nursery ! " was my cry .
" what for ?
are you hurt ? have you seen something ? " again demanded bessie .
" oh ! i saw a light , and i thought a ghost would come . "
i had now got hold of bessie 's hand , and she did not snatch it from me .
" she has screamed out on purpose , " declared abbot , in some disgust . " and what a scream !
if she had been in great pain one would have excused it , but she only wanted to bring us all here : i know her naughty tricks . "
" what is all this ? " demanded another voice peremptorily ; and mrs. reed came along the corridor , her cap flying wide , her gown rustling stormily .
" abbot and bessie , i believe i gave orders that jane eyre should be left in the red-room till i came to her myself . "
" miss jane screamed so loud , ma 'am , " pleaded bessie .
" let her go , " was the only answer .
" loose bessie 's hand , child : you cannot succeed in getting out by these means , be assured .
i abhor artifice , particularly in children ; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer : you will now stay here an hour longer , and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then . " " o aunt ! have pity !
forgive me ! i cannot endure it--let me be punished some other way ! i shall be killed if-- "
" silence ! this violence is all most repulsive : " and so , no doubt , she felt it .
i was a precocious actress in her eyes ; she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions , mean spirit , and dangerous duplicity .
bessie and abbot having retreated , mrs. reed , impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs , abruptly thrust me back and locked me in , without farther parley .
i heard her sweeping away ; and soon after she was gone , i suppose i had a species of fit : unconsciousness closed the scene .
chapter iii
the next thing i remember is , waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare , and seeing before me a terrible red glare , crossed with thick black bars .
i heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .
ere long , i became aware that some one was handling me ; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than i had ever been raised or upheld before . i rested my head against a pillow or an arm , and felt easy .
in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved : i knew quite well that i was in my own bed , and that the red glare was the nursery fire .
it was night : a candle burnt on the table ; bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her hand , and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow , leaning over me .
i felt an inexpressible relief , a soothing conviction of protection and security , when i knew that there was a stranger in the room , an individual not belonging to gateshead , and not related to mrs. reed .
turning from bessie ( though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of abbot , for instance , would have been ) , i scrutinised the face of the gentleman : i knew him ; it was mr. lloyd , an apothecary , sometimes called in by mrs. reed when the servants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed a physician .
" well , who am i ? " he asked .
i pronounced his name , offering him at the same time my hand : he took it , smiling and saying , " we shall do very well by-and-by . "
then he laid me down , and addressing bessie , charged her to be very careful that i was not disturbed during the night .
having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .
" do you feel as if you should sleep , miss ? " asked bessie , rather softly .
scarcely dared i answer her ; for i feared the next sentence might be rough . " i will try . "
" would you like to drink , or could you eat anything ? "
" no , thank you , bessie . "
" then i think i shall go to bed , for it is past twelve o 'clock ; but you may call me if you want anything in the night . "
wonderful civility this !
it emboldened me to ask a question .
" bessie , what is the matter with me ? am i ill ? "
" you fell sick , i suppose , in the red-room with crying ; you 'll be better soon , no doubt . "
bessie went into the housemaid 's apartment , which was near . i heard her say--
" sarah , come and sleep with me in the nursery ; i daren 't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night : she might die ; it 's such a strange thing she should have that fit : i wonder if she saw anything .
missis was rather too hard . "
sarah came back with her ; they both went to bed ; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep .
i caught scraps of their conversation , from which i was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed .
" something passed her , all dressed in white , and vanished " -- " a great black dog behind him " -- " three loud raps on the chamber door " -- " a light in the churchyard just over his grave , " & c . & c .
at last both slept : the fire and the candle went out .
for me , the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness ; strained by dread : such dread as children only can feel .
no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red- room ; it only gave my nerves a shock of which i feel the reverberation to this day .
yes , mrs. reed , to you i owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering , but i ought to forgive you , for you knew not what you did : while rending my heart-strings , you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities .
next day , by noon , i was up and dressed , and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth .
i felt physically weak and broken down : but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind : a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears ; no sooner had i wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed . yet , i thought , i ought to have been happy , for none of the reeds were there , they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama .
abbot , too , was sewing in another room , and bessie , as she moved hither and thither , putting away toys and arranging drawers , addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness .
this state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace , accustomed as i was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging ; but , in fact , my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe , and no pleasure excite them agreeably .
bessie had been down into the kitchen , and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate , whose bird of paradise , nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds , had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration ; and which plate i had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely , but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege . this precious vessel was now placed on my knee , and i was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it . vain favour ! coming , like most other favours long deferred and often wished for , too late !
i could not eat the tart ; and the plumage of the bird , the tints of the flowers , seemed strangely faded : i put both plate and tart away .
bessie asked if i would have a book : the word _ book _ acted as a transient stimulus , and i begged her to fetch gulliver 's travels from the library .
this book i had again and again perused with delight .
i considered it a narrative of facts , and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what i found in fairy tales : for as to the elves , having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells , under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks , i had at length made up my mind to the sad truth , that they were all gone out of england to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker , and the population more scant ; whereas , lilliput and brobdignag being , in my creed , solid parts of the earth 's surface , i doubted not that i might one day , by taking a long voyage , see with my own eyes the little fields , houses , and trees , the diminutive people , the tiny cows , sheep , and birds of the one realm ; and the corn-fields forest-high , the mighty mastiffs , the monster cats , the tower-like men and women , of the other .
yet , when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when i turned over its leaves , and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm i had , till now , never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary ; the giants were gaunt goblins , the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps , gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions .
i closed the book , which i dared no longer peruse , and put it on the table , beside the untasted tart .
bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room , and having washed her hands , she opened a certain little drawer , full of splendid shreds of silk and satin , and began making a new bonnet for georgiana 's doll .
meantime she sang : her song was--
" in the days when we went gipsying , a long time ago . "
i had often heard the song before , and always with lively delight ; for bessie had a sweet voice , --at least , i thought so . but now , though her voice was still sweet , i found in its melody an indescribable sadness .
sometimes , preoccupied with her work , she sang the refrain very low , very lingeringly ; " a long time ago " came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn .
she passed into another ballad , this time a really doleful one .
" my feet they are sore , and my limbs they are weary ; long is the way , and the mountains are wild ; soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary over the path of the poor orphan child .
why did they send me so far and so lonely , up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled ?
men are hard-hearted , and kind angels only watch o 'er the steps of a poor orphan child .
yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing , clouds there are none , and clear stars beam mild , god , in his mercy , protection is showing , comfort and hope to the poor orphan child .
ev 'n should i fall o 'er the broken bridge passing , or stray in the marshes , by false lights beguiled , still will my father , with promise and blessing , take to his bosom the poor orphan child .
there is a thought that for strength should avail me , though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ; heaven is a home , and a rest will not fail me ; god is a friend to the poor orphan child . "
" come , miss jane , don 't cry , " said bessie as she finished .
she might as well have said to the fire , " don 't burn ! " but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which i was a prey ?
in the course of the morning mr. lloyd came again .
" what , already up ! " said he , as he entered the nursery .
" well , nurse , how is she ? "
bessie answered that i was doing very well .
" then she ought to look more cheerful .
come here , miss jane : your name is jane , is it not ? "
" yes , sir , jane eyre . "
" well , you have been crying , miss jane eyre ; can you tell me what about ?
have you any pain ? "
" no , sir . " " oh !
i daresay she is crying because she could not go out with missis in the carriage , " interposed bessie .
" surely not ! why , she is too old for such pettishness . "
i thought so too ; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge , i answered promptly , " i never cried for such a thing in my life : i hate going out in the carriage . i cry because i am miserable . "
" oh fie , miss ! " said bessie .
the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled .
i was standing before him ; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily : his eyes were small and grey ; not very bright , but i dare say i should think them shrewd now : he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face .
having considered me at leisure , he said--
" what made you ill yesterday ? "
" she had a fall , " said bessie , again putting in her word .
" fall ! why , that is like a baby again !
can 't she manage to walk at her age ?
she must be eight or nine years old . "
" i was knocked down , " was the blunt explanation , jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride ; " but that did not make me ill , " i added ; while mr. lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff .
as he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket , a loud bell rang for the servants ' dinner ; he knew what it was .
" that 's for you , nurse , " said he ; " you can go down ; i 'll give miss jane a lecture till you come back . "
bessie would rather have stayed , but she was obliged to go , because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at gateshead hall .
" the fall did not make you ill ; what did , then ? " pursued mr. lloyd when bessie was gone .
" i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark . "
i saw mr. lloyd smile and frown at the same time .
" ghost ! what , you are a baby after all ! you are afraid of ghosts ? "
" of mr. reed 's ghost i am : he died in that room , and was laid out there .
neither bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle , --so cruel that i think i shall never forget it . "
" nonsense ! and is it that makes you so miserable ?
are you afraid now in daylight ? "
" no : but night will come again before long : and besides , --i am unhappy , --very unhappy , for other things . "
" what other things ?
can you tell me some of them ? "
how much i wished to reply fully to this question ! how difficult it was to frame any answer !
children can feel , but they cannot analyse their feelings ; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought , they know not how to express the result of the process in words .
fearful , however , of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it , i , after a disturbed pause , contrived to frame a meagre , though , as far as it went , true response .
" for one thing , i have no father or mother , brothers or sisters . "
" you have a kind aunt and cousins . "
again i paused ; then bunglingly enounced--
" but john reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red-room . "
mr. lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box .
" don 't you think gateshead hall a very beautiful house ? " asked he . " are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at ? "
" it is not my house , sir ; and abbot says i have less right to be here than a servant . "
" pooh ! you can 't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place ? "
" if i had anywhere else to go , i should be glad to leave it ; but i can never get away from gateshead till i am a woman . "
" perhaps you may--who knows ?
have you any relations besides mrs. reed ? "
" i think not , sir . "
" none belonging to your father ? "
" i don 't know . i asked aunt reed once , and she said possibly i might have some poor , low relations called eyre , but she knew nothing about them . "
" if you had such , would you like to go to them ? "
i reflected .
poverty looks grim to grown people ; still more so to children : they have not much idea of industrious , working , respectable poverty ; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes , scanty food , fireless grates , rude manners , and debasing vices : poverty for me was synonymous with degradation .
" no ; i should not like to belong to poor people , " was my reply .
" not even if they were kind to you ? "
i shook my head : i could not see how poor people had the means of being kind ; and then to learn to speak like them , to adopt their manners , to be uneducated , to grow up like one of the poor women i saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead : no , i was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste .
" but are your relatives so very poor ?
are they working people ? "
" i cannot tell ; aunt reed says if i have any , they must be a beggarly set : i should not like to go a begging . "
" would you like to go to school ? "
again i reflected : i scarcely knew what school was : bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks , wore backboards , and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise : john reed hated his school , and abused his master ; but john reed 's tastes were no rule for mine , and if bessie 's accounts of school-discipline ( gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to gateshead ) were somewhat appalling , her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were , i thought , equally attractive .
she boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed ; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play , of purses they could net , of french books they could translate ; till my spirit was moved to emulation as i listened .
besides , school would be a complete change : it implied a long journey , an entire separation from gateshead , an entrance into a new life .
" i should indeed like to go to school , " was the audible conclusion of my musings .
" well , well ! who knows what may happen ? " said mr. lloyd , as he got up .
" the child ought to have change of air and scene , " he added , speaking to himself ; " nerves not in a good state . "
bessie now returned ; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk .
" is that your mistress , nurse ? " asked mr. lloyd .
" i should like to speak to her before i go . "
bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room , and led the way out .
in the interview which followed between him and mrs. reed , i presume , from after-occurrences , that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school ; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted ; for as abbot said , in discussing the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night , after i was in bed , and , as they thought , asleep , " missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill-conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand . "
abbot , i think , gave me credit for being a sort of infantine guy fawkes .
on that same occasion i learned , for the first time , from miss abbot 's communications to bessie , that my father had been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends , who considered the match beneath her ; that my grandfather reed was so irritated at her disobedience , he cut her off without a shilling ; that after my mother and father had been married a year , the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated , and where that disease was then prevalent : that my mother took the infection from him , and both died within a month of each other .
bessie , when she heard this narrative , sighed and said , " poor miss jane is to be pitied , too , abbot . "
" yes , " responded abbot ; " if she were a nice , pretty child , one might compassionate her forlornness ; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that . "
" not a great deal , to be sure , " agreed bessie : " at any rate , a beauty like miss georgiana would be more moving in the same condition . " " yes , i doat on miss georgiana ! " cried the fervent abbot .
" little darling ! --with her long curls and her blue eyes , and such a sweet colour as she has ; just as if she were painted ! --bessie , i could fancy a welsh rabbit for supper . "
" so could i--with a roast onion . come , we 'll go down . "
they went .
chapter iv
from my discourse with mr. lloyd , and from the above reported conference between bessie and abbot , i gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well : a change seemed near , --i desired and waited it in silence .
it tarried , however : days and weeks passed : i had regained my normal state of health , but no new allusion was made to the subject over which i brooded .
mrs. reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
not a hint , however , did she drop about sending me to school : still i felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her ; for her glance , now more than ever , when turned on me , expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion .
eliza and georgiana , evidently acting according to orders , spoke to me as little as possible : john thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me , and once attempted chastisement ; but as i instantly turned against him , roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before , he thought it better to desist , and ran from me tittering execrations , and vowing i had burst his nose .
i had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and when i saw that either that or my look daunted him , i had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose ; but he was already with his mama . i heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how " that nasty jane eyre " had flown at him like a mad cat : he was stopped rather harshly--
" don 't talk to me about her , john : i told you not to go near her ; she is not worthy of notice ; i do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her . "
here , leaning over the banister , i cried out suddenly , and without at all deliberating on my words--
" they are not fit to associate with me . "
mrs. reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , and crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .
" what would uncle reed say to you , if he were alive ? " was my scarcely voluntary demand .
i say scarcely voluntary , for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance : something spoke out of me over which i had no control .
" what ? " said mrs. reed under her breath : her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear ; she took her hand from my arm , and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether i were child or fiend .
i was now in for it .
" my uncle reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you shut me up all day long , and how you wish me dead . "
mrs. reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , she boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .
bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour 's length , in which she proved beyond a doubt that i was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof .
i half believed her ; for i felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast .
november , december , and half of january passed away .
christmas and the new year had been celebrated at gateshead with the usual festive cheer ; presents had been interchanged , dinners and evening parties given .
from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing-room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed .
when tired of this occupation , i would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery : there , though somewhat sad , i was not miserable . to speak truth , i had not the least wish to go into company , for in company i was very rarely noticed ; and if bessie had but been kind and companionable , i should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her , instead of passing them under the formidable eye of mrs. reed , in a room full of ladies and gentlemen .
but bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her . i then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low , glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room ; and when the embers sank to a dull red , i undressed hastily , tugging at knots and strings as i best might , and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib .
to this crib i always took my doll ; human beings must love something , and , in the dearth of worthier objects of affection , i contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image , shabby as a miniature scarecrow .
it puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity i doated on this little toy , half fancying it alive and capable of sensation . i could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown ; and when it lay there safe and warm , i was comparatively happy , believing it to be happy likewise .
long did the hours seem while i waited the departure of the company , and listened for the sound of bessie 's step on the stairs : sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors , or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while i ate it , and when i had finished , she would tuck the clothes round me , and twice she kissed me , and said , " good night , miss jane . "
when thus gentle , bessie seemed to me the best , prettiest , kindest being in the world ; and i wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable , and never push me about , or scold , or task me unreasonably , as she was too often wont to do .
bessie lee must , i think , have been a girl of good natural capacity , for she was smart in all she did , and had a remarkable knack of narrative ; so , at least , i judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales .
she was pretty too , if my recollections of her face and person are correct .
i remember her as a slim young woman , with black hair , dark eyes , very nice features , and good , clear complexion ; but she had a capricious and hasty temper , and indifferent ideas of principle or justice : still , such as she was , i preferred her to any one else at gateshead hall .
it was the fifteenth of january , about nine o 'clock in the morning : bessie was gone down to breakfast ; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama ; eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry , an occupation of which she was fond : and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained .
she had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from mrs. reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .
as to her money , she first secreted it in odd corners , wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper ; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid , eliza , fearful of one day losing her valued treasure , consented to intrust it to her mother , at a usurious rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent . ; which interest she exacted every quarter , keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy .
georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .
i was making my bed , having received strict orders from bessie to get it arranged before she returned ( for bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under- nurserymaid , to tidy the room , dust the chairs , & c . ) .
having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress , i went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll 's house furniture scattered there ; an abrupt command from georgiana to let her playthings alone ( for the tiny chairs and mirrors , the fairy plates and cups , were her property ) stopped my proceedings ; and then , for lack of other occupation , i fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted , and thus clearing a space in the glass through which i might look out on the grounds , where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost .
from this window were visible the porter 's lodge and the carriage-road , and just as i had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out , i saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through .
i watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom i was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door-bell rang loudly , the new-comer was admitted .
all this being nothing to me , my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin , which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement .
the remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table , and having crumbled a morsel of roll , i was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill , when bessie came running upstairs into the nursery .
" miss jane , take off your pinafore ; what are you doing there ?
have you washed your hands and face this morning ? "
i gave another tug before i answered , for i wanted the bird to be secure of its bread : the sash yielded ; i scattered the crumbs , some on the stone sill , some on the cherry-tree bough , then , closing the window , i replied--
" no , bessie ; i have only just finished dusting . "
" troublesome , careless child ! and what are you doing now ?
you look quite red , as if you had been about some mischief : what were you opening the window for ? "
i was spared the trouble of answering , for bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations ; she hauled me to the washstand , inflicted a merciless , but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap , water , and a coarse towel ; disciplined my head with a bristly brush , denuded me of my pinafore , and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs , bid me go down directly , as i was wanted in the breakfast-room .
i would have asked who wanted me : i would have demanded if mrs. reed was there ; but bessie was already gone , and had closed the nursery-door upon me .
i slowly descended .
for nearly three months , i had never been called to mrs. reed 's presence ; restricted so long to the nursery , the breakfast , dining , and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions , on which it dismayed me to intrude .
i now stood in the empty hall ; before me was the breakfast-room door , and i stopped , intimidated and trembling .
what a miserable little poltroon had fear , engendered of unjust punishment , made of me in those days !
i feared to return to the nursery , and feared to go forward to the parlour ; ten minutes i stood in agitated hesitation ; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me ; i _ must _ enter .
" who could want me ? " i asked inwardly , as with both hands i turned the stiff door-handle , which , for a second or two , resisted my efforts .
" what should i see besides aunt reed in the apartment ? --a man or a woman ? "
the handle turned , the door unclosed , and passing through and curtseying low , i looked up at--a black pillar ! --such , at least , appeared to me , at first sight , the straight , narrow , sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug : the grim face at the top was like a carved mask , placed above the shaft by way of capital .
mrs. reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside ; she made a signal to me to approach ; i did so , and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words : " this is the little girl respecting whom i applied to you . "
_ he _ , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where i stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , " her size is small : what is her age ? "
" ten years . "
" so much ? " was the doubtful answer ; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes . presently he addressed me-- " your name , little girl ? "
" jane eyre , sir . "
in uttering these words i looked up : he seemed to me a tall gentleman ; but then i was very little ; his features were large , and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim .
" well , jane eyre , and are you a good child ? "
impossible to reply to this in the affirmative : my little world held a contrary opinion : i was silent .
mrs. reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , " perhaps the less said on that subject the better , mr. brocklehurst . "
" sorry indeed to hear it ! she and i must have some talk ; " and bending from the perpendicular , he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite mrs. reed 's .
" come here , " he said .
i stepped across the rug ; he placed me square and straight before him .
what a face he had , now that it was almost on a level with mine ! what a great nose ! and what a mouth ! and what large prominent teeth !
" no sight so sad as that of a naughty child , " he began , " especially a naughty little girl .
do you know where the wicked go after death ? "
" they go to hell , " was my ready and orthodox answer .
" and what is hell ? can you tell me that ? "
" a pit full of fire . "
" and should you like to fall into that pit , and to be burning there for ever ? "
" no , sir . "
" what must you do to avoid it ? "
i deliberated a moment ; my answer , when it did come , was objectionable : " i must keep in good health , and not die . "
" how can you keep in good health ? children younger than you die daily .
i buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since , --a good little child , whose soul is now in heaven . it is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence . "
not being in a condition to remove his doubt , i only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug , and sighed , wishing myself far enough away .
" i hope that sigh is from the heart , and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress . "
" benefactress ! benefactress ! " said i inwardly : " they all call mrs. reed my benefactress ; if so , a benefactress is a disagreeable thing . "
" do you say your prayers night and morning ? " continued my interrogator .
" yes , sir . "
" do you read your bible ? "
" sometimes . "
" with pleasure ? are you fond of it ? "
" i like revelations , and the book of daniel , and genesis and samuel , and a little bit of exodus , and some parts of kings and chronicles , and job and jonah . "
" and the psalms ? i hope you like them ? "
" no , sir . "
" no ? oh , shocking !
i have a little boy , younger than you , who knows six psalms by heart : and when you ask him which he would rather have , a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn , he says : ' oh ! the verse of a psalm ! angels sing psalms ; ' says he , ' i wish to be a little angel here below ; ' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety . "
" psalms are not interesting , " i remarked .
" that proves you have a wicked heart ; and you must pray to god to change it : to give you a new and clean one : to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh . "
i was about to propound a question , touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed , when mrs. reed interposed , telling me to sit down ; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself .
" mr. brocklehurst , i believe i intimated in the letter which i wrote to you three weeks ago , that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition i could wish : should you admit her into lowood school , i should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her , and , above all , to guard against her worst fault , a tendency to deceit .
i mention this in your hearing , jane , that you may not attempt to impose on mr. brocklehurst . "
well might i dread , well might i dislike mrs. reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was i happy in her presence ; however carefully i obeyed , however strenuously i strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
now , uttered before a stranger , the accusation cut me to the heart ; i dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter ; i felt , though i could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ; i saw myself transformed under mr. brocklehurst 's eye into an artful , noxious child , and what could i do to remedy the injury ?
" nothing , indeed , " thought i , as i struggled to repress a sob , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .
" deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , " said mr. brocklehurst ; " it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , mrs. reed . i will speak to miss temple and the teachers . "
" i should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects , " continued my benefactress ; " to be made useful , to be kept humble : as for the vacations , she will , with your permission , spend them always at lowood . "
" your decisions are perfectly judicious , madam , " returned mr. brocklehurst . " humility is a christian grace , and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of lowood ; i , therefore , direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them .
i have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; and , only the other day , i had a pleasing proof of my success .
my second daughter , augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : ' oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls at lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people 's children ! and , ' said she , ' they looked at my dress and mama 's , as if they had never seen a silk gown before . ' "
" this is the state of things i quite approve , " returned mrs. reed ; " had i sought all england over , i could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like jane eyre .
consistency , my dear mr. brocklehurst ; i advocate consistency in all things . "
" consistency , madam , is the first of christian duties ; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of lowood : plain fare , simple attire , unsophisticated accommodations , hardy and active habits ; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants . "
" quite right , sir . i may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at lowood , and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects ? "
" madam , you may : she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants , and i trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election . "
" i will send her , then , as soon as possible , mr. brocklehurst ; for , i assure you , i feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome . "
" no doubt , no doubt , madam ; and now i wish you good morning .
i shall return to brocklehurst hall in the course of a week or two : my good friend , the archdeacon , will not permit me to leave him sooner . i shall send miss temple notice that she is to expect a new girl , so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her .
good-bye . "
" good-bye , mr. brocklehurst ; remember me to mrs. and miss brocklehurst , and to augusta and theodore , and master broughton brocklehurst . "
" i will , madam .
little girl , here is a book entitled the ' child 's guide , ' read it with prayer , especially that part containing ' an account of the awfully sudden death of martha g--- , a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit . ' "
with these words mr. brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .
mrs. reed and i were left alone : some minutes passed in silence ; she was sewing , i was watching her .
mrs. reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty ; she was a woman of robust frame , square-shouldered and strong-limbed , not tall , and , though stout , not obese : she had a somewhat large face , the under jaw being much developed and very solid ; her brow was low , her chin large and prominent , mouth and nose sufficiently regular ; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth ; her skin was dark and opaque , her hair nearly flaxen ; her constitution was sound as a bell--illness never came near her ; she was an exact , clever manager ; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control ; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn ; she dressed well , and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire .
sitting on a low stool , a few yards from her arm-chair , i examined her figure ; i perused her features .
in my hand i held the tract containing the sudden death of the liar , to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning .
what had just passed ; what mrs. reed had said concerning me to mr. brocklehurst ; the whole tenor of their conversation , was recent , raw , and stinging in my mind ; i had felt every word as acutely as i had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .
mrs. reed looked up from her work ; her eye settled on mine , her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements .
" go out of the room ; return to the nursery , " was her mandate .
my look or something else must have struck her as offensive , for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation .
i got up , i went to the door ; i came back again ; i walked to the window , across the room , then close up to her .
_ speak _ i must : i had been trodden on severely , and _ must _ turn : but how ?
what strength had i to dart retaliation at my antagonist ?
i gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
" i am not deceitful : if i were , i should say i loved you ; but i declare i do not love you : i dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except john reed ; and this book about the liar , you may give to your girl , georgiana , for it is she who tells lies , and not i. "
mrs. reed 's hands still lay on her work inactive : her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine .
" what more have you to say ? " she asked , rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child .
that eye of hers , that voice stirred every antipathy i had .
shaking from head to foot , thrilled with ungovernable excitement , i continued--
" i am glad you are no relation of mine : i will never call you aunt again as long as i live . i will never come to see you when i am grown up ; and if any one asks me how i liked you , and how you treated me , i will say the very thought of you makes me sick , and that you treated me with miserable cruelty . "
" how dare you affirm that , jane eyre ? "
" how dare i , mrs. reed ? how dare i ?
because it is the _ truth _ .
you think i have no feelings , and that i can do without one bit of love or kindness ; but i cannot live so : and you have no pity . i shall remember how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the red-room , and locked me up there , to my dying day ; though i was in agony ; though i cried out , while suffocating with distress ,
'have mercy ! have mercy , aunt reed ! '
and that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing .
i will tell anybody who asks me questions , this exact tale .
people think you a good woman , but you are bad , hard-hearted . _ you _ are deceitful ! "
ere i had finished this reply , my soul began to expand , to exult , with the strangest sense of freedom , of triumph , i ever felt .
it seemed as if an invisible bond had burst , and that i had struggled out into unhoped- for liberty .
not without cause was this sentiment : mrs. reed looked frightened ; her work had slipped from her knee ; she was lifting up her hands , rocking herself to and fro , and even twisting her face as if she would cry .
" jane , you are under a mistake : what is the matter with you ?
why do you tremble so violently ? would you like to drink some water ? "
" no , mrs. reed . "
" is there anything else you wish for , jane ?
i assure you , i desire to be your friend . "
" not you . you told mr. brocklehurst i had a bad character , a deceitful disposition ; and i 'll let everybody at lowood know what you are , and what you have done . "
" jane , you don 't understand these things : children must be corrected for their faults . "
" deceit is not my fault ! " i cried out in a savage , high voice .
" but you are passionate , jane , that you must allow : and now return to the nursery--there 's a dear--and lie down a little . "
" i am not your dear ; i cannot lie down : send me to school soon , mrs. reed , for i hate to live here . "
" i will indeed send her to school soon , " murmured mrs. reed _ sotto voce _ ; and gathering up her work , she abruptly quitted the apartment .
i was left there alone--winner of the field . it was the hardest battle i had fought , and the first victory i had gained : i stood awhile on the rug , where mr. brocklehurst had stood , and i enjoyed my conqueror 's solitude .
first , i smiled to myself and felt elate ; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses . a child cannot quarrel with its elders , as i had done ; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play , as i had given mine , without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction .
a ridge of lighted heath , alive , glancing , devouring , would have been a meet emblem of my mind when i accused and menaced mrs. reed : the same ridge , black and blasted after the flames are dead , would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition , when half-an-hour 's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct , and the dreariness of my hated and hating position .
something of vengeance i had tasted for the first time ; as aromatic wine it seemed , on swallowing , warm and racy : its after-flavour , metallic and corroding , gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned .
willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs. reed 's pardon ; but i knew , partly from experience and partly from instinct , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .
i would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking ; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation .
i took a book--some arabian tales ; i sat down and endeavoured to read . i could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page i had usually found fascinating .
i opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room : the shrubbery was quite still : the black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .
i covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock , and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated ; but i found no pleasure in the silent trees , the falling fir-cones , the congealed relics of autumn , russet leaves , swept by past winds in heaps , and now stiffened together . i leaned against a gate , and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding , where the short grass was nipped and blanched .
it was a very grey day ; a most opaque sky , " onding on snaw , " canopied all ; thence flakes felt it intervals , which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting .
i stood , a wretched child enough , whispering to myself over and over again , " what shall i do ? --what shall i do ? "
all at once i heard a clear voice call , " miss jane ! where are you ? come to lunch ! "
it was bessie , i knew well enough ; but i did not stir ; her light step came tripping down the path .
" you naughty little thing ! " she said . " why don 't you come when you are called ? "
bessie 's presence , compared with the thoughts over which i had been brooding , seemed cheerful ; even though , as usual , she was somewhat cross .
the fact is , after my conflict with and victory over mrs. reed , i was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid 's transitory anger ; and i _ was _ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart .
i just put my two arms round her and said , " come , bessie ! don 't scold . "
the action was more frank and fearless than any i was habituated to indulge in : somehow it pleased her .
" you are a strange child , miss jane , " she said , as she looked down at me ; " a little roving , solitary thing : and you are going to school , i suppose ? "
i nodded .
" and won 't you be sorry to leave poor bessie ? "
" what does bessie care for me ? she is always scolding me . "
" because you 're such a queer , frightened , shy little thing .
you should be bolder . "
" what ! to get more knocks ? "
" nonsense !
but you are rather put upon , that 's certain . my mother said , when she came to see me last week , that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.--now , come in , and i 've some good news for you . "
" i don 't think you have , bessie . "
" child ! what do you mean ?
what sorrowful eyes you fix on me !
well , but missis and the young ladies and master john are going out to tea this afternoon , and you shall have tea with me . i 'll ask cook to bake you a little cake , and then you shall help me to look over your drawers ; for i am soon to pack your trunk .
missis intends you to leave gateshead in a day or two , and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you . "
" bessie , you must promise not to scold me any more till i go . "
" well , i will ; but mind you are a very good girl , and don 't be afraid of me .
don 't start when i chance to speak rather sharply ; it 's so provoking . "
" i don 't think i shall ever be afraid of you again , bessie , because i have got used to you , and i shall soon have another set of people to dread . "
" if you dread them they 'll dislike you . "
" as you do , bessie ? "
" i don 't dislike you , miss ; i believe i am fonder of you than of all the others . "
" you don 't show it . "
" you little sharp thing ! you 've got quite a new way of talking .
what makes you so venturesome and hardy ? "
" why , i shall soon be away from you , and besides " --i was going to say something about what had passed between me and mrs. reed , but on second thoughts i considered it better to remain silent on that head .
" and so you 're glad to leave me ? "
" not at all , bessie ; indeed , just now i 'm rather sorry . "
" just now ! and rather ! how coolly my little lady says it !
i dare say now if i were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn 't give it me : you 'd say you 'd _ rather _ not . "
" i 'll kiss you and welcome : bend your head down . "
bessie stooped ; we mutually embraced , and i followed her into the house quite comforted .
that afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony ; and in the evening bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories , and sang me some of her sweetest songs .
even for me life had its gleams of sunshine .
chapter v
five o 'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of january , when bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed .
i had risen half-an-hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .
i was to leave gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m .
bessie was the only person yet risen ; she had lit a fire in the nursery , where she now proceeded to make my breakfast .
few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey ; nor could i. bessie , having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me , wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag ; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet , and wrapping herself in a shawl , she and i left the nursery .
as we passed mrs. reed 's bedroom , she said , " will you go in and bid missis good- bye ? "
" no , bessie : she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper , and said i need not disturb her in the morning , or my cousins either ; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend , and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly . "
" what did you say , miss ? "
" nothing : i covered my face with the bedclothes , and turned from her to the wall . "
" that was wrong , miss jane . "
" it was quite right , bessie .
your missis has not been my friend : she has been my foe . "
" o miss jane ! don 't say so ! "
" good-bye to gateshead ! " cried i , as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door .
the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .
there was a light in the porter 's lodge : when we reached it , we found the porter 's wife just kindling her fire : my trunk , which had been carried down the evening before , stood corded at the door .
it wanted but a few minutes of six , and shortly after that hour had struck , the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach ; i went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom .
" is she going by herself ? " asked the porter 's wife .
" yes . "
" and how far is it ? "
" fifty miles . "
" what a long way ! i wonder mrs. reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone . "
the coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guard and coachman loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted up ; i was taken from bessie 's neck , to which i clung with kisses .
" be sure and take good care of her , " cried she to the guard , as he lifted me into the inside .
" ay , ay ! " was the answer : the door was slapped to , a voice exclaimed " all right , " and on we drove .
thus was i severed from bessie and gateshead ; thus whirled away to unknown , and , as i then deemed , remote and mysterious regions .
i remember but little of the journey ; i only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length , and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road .
we passed through several towns , and in one , a very large one , the coach stopped ; the horses were taken out , and the passengers alighted to dine .
i was carried into an inn , where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but , as i had no appetite , he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end , a chandelier pendent from the ceiling , and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments .
here i walked about for a long time , feeling very strange , and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me ; for i believed in kidnappers , their exploits having frequently figured in bessie 's fireside chronicles .
at last the guard returned ; once more i was stowed away in the coach , my protector mounted his own seat , sounded his hollow horn , and away we rattled over the " stony street " of l- .
the afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty : as it waned into dusk , i began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from gateshead : we ceased to pass through towns ; the country changed ; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon : as twilight deepened , we descended a valley , dark with wood , and long after night had overclouded the prospect , i heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees .
lulled by the sound , i at last dropped asleep ; i had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me ; the coach-door was open , and a person like a servant was standing at it : i saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps .
" is there a little girl called jane eyre here ? " she asked .
i answered " yes , " and was then lifted out ; my trunk was handed down , and the coach instantly drove away .
i was stiff with long sitting , and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach : gathering my faculties , i looked about me .
rain , wind , and darkness filled the air ; nevertheless , i dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it ; through this door i passed with my new guide : she shut and locked it behind her .
there was now visible a house or houses--for the building spread far--with many windows , and lights burning in some ; we went up a broad pebbly path , splashing wet , and were admitted at a door ; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire , where she left me alone .
i stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze , then i looked round ; there was no candle , but the uncertain light from the hearth showed , by intervals , papered walls , carpet , curtains , shining mahogany furniture : it was a parlour , not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at gateshead , but comfortable enough .
i was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall , when the door opened , and an individual carrying a light entered ; another followed close behind .
the first was a tall lady with dark hair , dark eyes , and a pale and large forehead ; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl , her countenance was grave , her bearing erect .
" the child is very young to be sent alone , " said she , putting her candle down on the table .
she considered me attentively for a minute or two , then further added--
" she had better be put to bed soon ; she looks tired : are you tired ? " she asked , placing her hand on my shoulder .
" a little , ma 'am . "
" and hungry too , no doubt : let her have some supper before she goes to bed , miss miller .
is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school , my little girl ? "
i explained to her that i had no parents . she inquired how long they had been dead : then how old i was , what was my name , whether i could read , write , and sew a little : then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger , and saying , " she hoped i should be a good child , " dismissed me along with miss miller .
the lady i had left might be about twenty-nine ; the one who went with me appeared some years younger : the first impressed me by her voice , look , and air .
miss miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what i afterwards found she really was , an under-teacher .
led by her , i passed from compartment to compartment , from passage to passage , of a large and irregular building ; till , emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed , we came upon the hum of many voices , and presently entered a wide , long room , with great deal tables , two at each end , on each of which burnt a pair of candles , and seated all round on benches , a congregation of girls of every age , from nine or ten to twenty .
seen by the dim light of the dips , their number to me appeared countless , though not in reality exceeding eighty ; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion , and long holland pinafores .
it was the hour of study ; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow 's task , and the hum i had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions .
miss miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door , then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out--
" monitors , collect the lesson-books and put them away ! "
four tall girls arose from different tables , and going round , gathered the books and removed them .
miss miller again gave the word of command--
" monitors , fetch the supper-trays ! "
the tall girls went out and returned presently , each bearing a tray , with portions of something , i knew not what , arranged thereon , and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray .
the portions were handed round ; those who liked took a draught of the water , the mug being common to all .
when it came to my turn , i drank , for i was thirsty , but did not touch the food , excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating : i now saw , however , that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments .
the meal over , prayers were read by miss miller , and the classes filed off , two and two , upstairs .
overpowered by this time with weariness , i scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was , except that , like the schoolroom , i saw it was very long .
to-night i was to be miss miller 's bed-fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down i glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep .
the night passed rapidly . i was too tired even to dream ; i only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts , and the rain fall in torrents , and to be sensible that miss miller had taken her place by my side .
when i again unclosed my eyes , a loud bell was ringing ; the girls were up and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn , and a rushlight or two burned in the room .
i too rose reluctantly ; it was bitter cold , and i dressed as well as i could for shivering , and washed when there was a basin at liberty , which did not occur soon , as there was but one basin to six girls , on the stands down the middle of the room .
again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by miss miller ; afterwards she called out--
" form classes ! "
a great tumult succeeded for some minutes , during which miss miller repeatedly exclaimed , " silence ! " and " order ! "
when it subsided , i saw them all drawn up in four semicircles , before four chairs , placed at the four tables ; all held books in their hands , and a great book , like a bible , lay on each table , before the vacant seat .
a pause of some seconds succeeded , filled up by the low , vague hum of numbers ; miss miller walked from class to class , hushing this indefinite sound .
a distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered the room , each walked to a table and took her seat .
miss miller assumed the fourth vacant chair , which was that nearest the door , and around which the smallest of the children were assembled : to this inferior class i was called , and placed at the bottom of it .
business now began , the day 's collect was repeated , then certain texts of scripture were said , and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the bible , which lasted an hour .
by the time that exercise was terminated , day had fully dawned .
the indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast : how glad i was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat !
i was now nearly sick from inanition , having taken so little the day before .
the refectory was a great , low-ceiled , gloomy room ; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot , which , however , to my dismay , sent forth an odour far from inviting .
i saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it ; from the van of the procession , the tall girls of the first class , rose the whispered words--
" disgusting ! the porridge is burnt again ! "
" silence ! " ejaculated a voice ; not that of miss miller , but one of the upper teachers , a little and dark personage , smartly dressed , but of somewhat morose aspect , who installed herself at the top of one table , while a more buxom lady presided at the other .
i looked in vain for her i had first seen the night before ; she was not visible : miss miller occupied the foot of the table where i sat , and a strange , foreign-looking , elderly lady , the french teacher , as i afterwards found , took the corresponding seat at the other board .
a long grace was said and a hymn sung ; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers , and the meal began .
ravenous , and now very faint , i devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste ; but the first edge of hunger blunted , i perceived i had got in hand a nauseous mess ; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes ; famine itself soon sickens over it .
the spoons were moved slowly : i saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it ; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished .
breakfast was over , and none had breakfasted . thanks being returned for what we had not got , and a second hymn chanted , the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom .
i was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , i saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered--
" abominable stuff ! how shameful ! "
a quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began , during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely , and they used their privilege .
the whole conversation ran on the breakfast , which one and all abused roundly .
poor things ! it was the sole consolation they had .
miss miller was now the only teacher in the room : a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures .
i heard the name of mr. brocklehurst pronounced by some lips ; at which miss miller shook her head disapprovingly ; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath ; doubtless she shared in it .
a clock in the schoolroom struck nine ; miss miller left her circle , and standing in the middle of the room , cried--
" silence ! to your seats ! "
discipline prevailed : in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order , and comparative silence quelled the babel clamour of tongues .
the upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts : but still , all seemed to wait .
ranged on benches down the sides of the room , the eighty girls sat motionless and erect ; a quaint assemblage they appeared , all with plain locks combed from their faces , not a curl visible ; in brown dresses , made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat , with little pockets of holland ( shaped something like a highlander 's purse ) tied in front of their frocks , and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag : all , too , wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes , fastened with brass buckles .
above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls , or rather young women ; it suited them ill , and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest .
i was still looking at them , and also at intervals examining the teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me ; for the stout one was a little coarse , the dark one not a little fierce , the foreigner harsh and grotesque , and miss miller , poor thing ! looked purple , weather-beaten , and over-worked--when , as my eye wandered from face to face , the whole school rose simultaneously , as if moved by a common spring .
what was the matter ? i had heard no order given : i was puzzled .
ere i had gathered my wits , the classes were again seated : but as all eyes were now turned to one point , mine followed the general direction , and encountered the personage who had received me last night .
she stood at the bottom of the long room , on the hearth ; for there was a fire at each end ; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely .
miss miller approaching , seemed to ask her a question , and having received her answer , went back to her place , and said aloud--
" monitor of the first class , fetch the globes ! "
while the direction was being executed , the lady consulted moved slowly up the room . i suppose i have a considerable organ of veneration , for i retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps .
seen now , in broad daylight , she looked tall , fair , and shapely ; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids , and a fine pencilling of long lashes round , relieved the whiteness of her large front ; on each of her temples her hair , of a very dark brown , was clustered in round curls , according to the fashion of those times , when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue ; her dress , also in the mode of the day , was of purple cloth , relieved by a sort of spanish trimming of black velvet ; a gold watch ( watches were not so common then as now ) shone at her girdle .
let the reader add , to complete the picture , refined features ; a complexion , if pale , clear ; and a stately air and carriage , and he will have , at least , as clearly as words can give it , a correct idea of the exterior of miss temple--maria temple , as i afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church .
the superintendent of lowood ( for such was this lady ) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables , summoned the first class round her , and commenced giving a lesson on geography ; the lower classes were called by the teachers : repetitions in history , grammar , & c . , went on for an hour ; writing and arithmetic succeeded , and music lessons were given by miss temple to some of the elder girls .
the duration of each lesson was measured by the clock , which at last struck twelve .
the superintendent rose--
" i have a word to address to the pupils , " said she .
the tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth , but it sank at her voice .
she went on-- " you had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat ; you must be hungry : --i have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all . "
the teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise .
" it is to be done on my responsibility , " she added , in an explanatory tone to them , and immediately afterwards left the room .
the bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed , to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school .
the order was now given " to the garden ! " each put on a coarse straw bonnet , with strings of coloured calico , and a cloak of grey frieze . i was similarly equipped , and , following the stream , i made my way into the open air .
the garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .
when full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty ; but now , at the latter end of january , all was wintry blight and brown decay .
i shuddered as i stood and looked round me : it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise ; not positively rainy , but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog ; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday .
the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .
as yet i had spoken to no one , nor did anybody seem to take notice of me ; i stood lonely enough : but to that feeling of isolation i was accustomed ; it did not oppress me much .
i leant against a pillar of the verandah , drew my grey mantle close about me , and , trying to forget the cold which nipped me without , and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within , delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking .
my reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record : i hardly yet knew where i was ; gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance ; the present was vague and strange , and of the future i could form no conjecture .
i looked round the convent-like garden , and then up at the house--a large building , half of which seemed grey and old , the other half quite new .
the new part , containing the schoolroom and dormitory , was lit by mullioned and latticed windows , which gave it a church-like aspect ; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription : --
" lowood institution.--this portion was rebuilt a.d. --- , by naomi brocklehurst , of brocklehurst hall , in this county . "
" let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your father which is in heaven . " --st .
matt. v. 16 .
i read these words over and over again : i felt that an explanation belonged to them , and was unable fully to penetrate their import .
i was still pondering the signification of " institution , " and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of scripture , when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head .
i saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near ; she was bent over a book , on the perusal of which she seemed intent : from where i stood i could see the title--it was " rasselas ; " a name that struck me as strange , and consequently attractive .
in turning a leaf she happened to look up , and i said to her directly--
" is your book interesting ? "
i had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day .
" i like it , " she answered , after a pause of a second or two , during which she examined me .
" what is it about ? " i continued .
i hardly know where i found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger ; the step was contrary to my nature and habits : but i think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere ; for i too liked reading , though of a frivolous and childish kind ; i could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial .
" you may look at it , " replied the girl , offering me the book .
i did so ; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title : " rasselas " looked dull to my trifling taste ; i saw nothing about fairies , nothing about genii ; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages .
i returned it to her ; she received it quietly , and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood : again i ventured to disturb her--
" can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means ?
what is lowood institution ? "
" this house where you are come to live . "
" and why do they call it institution ?
is it in any way different from other schools ? "
" it is partly a charity-school : you and i , and all the rest of us , are charity-children .
i suppose you are an orphan : are not either your father or your mother dead ? "
" both died before i can remember . "
" well , all the girls here have lost either one or both parents , and this is called an institution for educating orphans . "
" do we pay no money ? do they keep us for nothing ? "
" we pay , or our friends pay , fifteen pounds a year for each . "
" then why do they call us charity-children ? "
" because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching , and the deficiency is supplied by subscription . "
" who subscribes ? "
" different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in london . "
" who was naomi brocklehurst ? "
" the lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records , and whose son overlooks and directs everything here . "
" why ? "
" because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment . "
" then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch , and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ? "
" to miss temple ? oh , no !
i wish it did : she has to answer to mr. brocklehurst for all she does .
mr. brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes . "
" does he live here ? "
" no--two miles off , at a large hall . "
" is he a good man ? "
" he is a clergyman , and is said to do a great deal of good . "
" did you say that tall lady was called miss temple ? "
" yes . "
" and what are the other teachers called ? "
" the one with red cheeks is called miss smith ; she attends to the work , and cuts out--for we make our own clothes , our frocks , and pelisses , and everything ; the little one with black hair is miss scatcherd ; she teaches history and grammar , and hears the second class repetitions ; and the one who wears a shawl , and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband , is madame pierrot : she comes from lisle , in france , and teaches french . "
" do you like the teachers ? "
" well enough . "
" do you like the little black one , and the madame --- ? --i cannot pronounce her name as you do . "
" miss scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her ; madame pierrot is not a bad sort of person . "
" but miss temple is the best--isn 't she ? "
" miss temple is very good and very clever ; she is above the rest , because she knows far more than they do . "
" have you been long here ? "
" two years . "
" are you an orphan ? "
" my mother is dead . "
" are you happy here ? "
" you ask rather too many questions . i have given you answers enough for the present : now i want to read . "
but at that moment the summons sounded for dinner ; all re-entered the house .
the odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast : the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels , whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat .
i found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat , mixed and cooked together .
of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil . i ate what i could , and wondered within myself whether every day 's fare would be like this .
after dinner , we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom : lessons recommenced , and were continued till five o 'clock .
the only marked event of the afternoon was , that i saw the girl with whom i had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by miss scatcherd from a history class , and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom .
the punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious , especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards . i expected she would show signs of great distress and shame ; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed : composed , though grave , she stood , the central mark of all eyes .
" how can she bear it so quietly--so firmly ? " i asked of myself . " were i in her place , it seems to me i should wish the earth to open and swallow me up .
she looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation : of something not round her nor before her .
i have heard of day-dreams--is she in a day-dream now ?
her eyes are fixed on the floor , but i am sure they do not see it--her sight seems turned in , gone down into her heart : she is looking at what she can remember , i believe ; not at what is really present .
i wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty . "
soon after five p.m. we had another meal , consisting of a small mug of coffee , and half-a-slice of brown bread . i devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish ; but i should have been glad of as much more--i was still hungry .
half-an-hour 's recreation succeeded , then study ; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake , prayers , and bed .
such was my first day at lowood .
chapter vi
the next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen .
a change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice .
before the long hour and a half of prayers and bible-reading was over , i felt ready to perish with cold .
breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was not burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small .
how small my portion seemed ! i wished it had been doubled .
in the course of the day i was enrolled a member of the fourth class , and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me : hitherto , i had only been a spectator of the proceedings at lowood ; i was now to become an actor therein .
at first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and i was glad when , about three o 'clock in the afternoon , miss smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c . , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .
at that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round miss scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of miss scatcherd on the performance .
it was english history : among the readers i observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at the top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom .
even in that obscure position , miss scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : --
" burns " ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , " burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . "
" burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in . "
" burns , i insist on your holding your head up ; i will not have you before me in that attitude , " & c . & c .
a chapter having been read through twice , the books were closed and the girls examined .
the lesson had comprised part of the reign of charles i. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point .
i kept expecting that miss scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out--
" you dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning ! "
burns made no answer : i wondered at her silence .
" why , " thought i , " does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? "
my attention was now called off by miss smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether i had ever been at school before , whether i could mark , stitch , knit , & c . ; till she dismissed me , i could not pursue my observations on miss scatcherd 's movements .
when i returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which i did not catch the import ; but burns immediately left the class , and going into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end .
this ominous tool she presented to miss scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs .
not a tear rose to burns ' eye ; and , while i paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression .
" hardened girl ! " exclaimed miss scatcherd ; " nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away . "
burns obeyed : i looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek .
the play-hour in the evening i thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o 'clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty .
on the evening of the day on which i had seen miss scatcherd flog her pupil , burns , i wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when i passed the windows , i now and then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , i could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside .
probably , if i had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when i should most keenly have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace ! as it was , i derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , i wished the wind to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour .
jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , i made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , i found burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers .
" is it still ' rasselas ' ? " i asked , coming behind her .
" yes , " she said , " and i have just finished it . "
and in five minutes more she shut it up . i was glad of this .
" now , " thought i , " i can perhaps get her to talk . "
i sat down by her on the floor .
" what is your name besides burns ? "
" helen . "
" do you come a long way from here ? "
" i come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of scotland . "
" will you ever go back ? "
" i hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future . "
" you must wish to leave lowood ? "
" no ! why should i ?
i was sent to lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until i have attained that object . "
" but that teacher , miss scatcherd , is so cruel to you ? " " cruel ?
not at all ! she is severe : she dislikes my faults . "
" and if i were in your place i should dislike her ; i should resist her . if she struck me with that rod , i should get it from her hand ; i should break it under her nose . "
" probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , mr. brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations .
it is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the bible bids us return good for evil . "
" but then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : i am far younger than you , and i could not bear it . "
" yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you _ cannot bear _ what it is your fate to be required to bear . "
i heard her with wonder : i could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and still less could i understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser .
still i felt that helen burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes . i suspected she might be right and i wrong ; but i would not ponder the matter deeply ; like felix , i put it off to a more convenient season .
" you say you have faults , helen : what are they ?
to me you seem very good . "
" then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : i am , as miss scatcherd said , slatternly ; i seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; i am careless ; i forget rules ; i read when i should learn my lessons ; i have no method ; and sometimes i say , like you , i cannot _ bear _ to be subjected to systematic arrangements .
this is all very provoking to miss scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular . "
" and cross and cruel , " i added ; but helen burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence .
" is miss temple as severe to you as miss scatcherd ? "
at the utterance of miss temple 's name , a soft smile flitted over her grave face .
" miss temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if i do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally . one strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though i value it most highly , cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight . "
" that is curious , " said i , " it is so easy to be careful . "
" for _ you _ i have no doubt it is .
i observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while miss miller explained the lesson and questioned you .
now , mine continually rove away ; when i should be listening to miss scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often i lose the very sound of her voice ; i fall into a sort of dream .
sometimes i think i am in northumberland , and that the noises i hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through deepden , near our house ; --then , when it comes to my turn to reply , i have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , i have no answer ready . "
" yet how well you replied this afternoon . "
" it was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me .
this afternoon , instead of dreaming of deepden , i was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as charles the first sometimes did ; and i thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown .
if he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending !
still , i like charles--i respect him--i pity him , poor murdered king ! yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed .
how dared they kill him ! "
helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten i could not very well understand her--that i was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed . i recalled her to my level .
" and when miss temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ? "
" no , certainly , not often ; because miss temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what i wished to gain . "
" well , then , with miss temple you are good ? "
" yes , in a passive way : i make no effort ; i follow as inclination guides me . there is no merit in such goodness . "
" a great deal : you are good to those who are good to you . it is all i ever desire to be .
if people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse .
when we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ; i am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again . "
" you will change your mind , i hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl . "
" but i feel this , helen ; i must dislike those who , whatever i do to please them , persist in disliking me ; i must resist those who punish me unjustly . it is as natural as that i should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when i feel it is deserved . "
" heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but christians and civilised nations disown it . "
" how ?
i don 't understand . "
" it is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury . "
" what then ? "
" read the new testament , and observe what christ says , and how he acts ; make his word your rule , and his conduct your example . "
" what does he say ? "
" love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . "
" then i should love mrs. reed , which i cannot do ; i should bless her son john , which is impossible . "
in her turn , helen burns asked me to explain , and i proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments .
bitter and truculent when excited , i spoke as i felt , without reserve or softening .
helen heard me patiently to the end : i expected she would then make a remark , but she said nothing .
" well , " i asked impatiently , " is not mrs. reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ? "
" she has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as miss scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you !
what a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart !
no ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings .
would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ?
life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs .
we are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , i trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , --the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !
surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? no ; i cannot believe that : i hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which i seldom mention ; but in which i delight , and to which i cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes eternity a rest--a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss .
besides , with this creed , i can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; i can so sincerely forgive the first while i abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : i live in calm , looking to the end . "
helen 's head , always drooping , sank a little lower as she finished this sentence . i saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts .
she was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great rough girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong cumberland accent--
" helen burns , if you don 't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , i 'll tell miss scatcherd to come and look at it ! "
helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay .
chapter vii
my first quarter at lowood seemed an age ; and not the golden age either ; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks .
the fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot ; though these were no trifles .
during january , february , and part of march , the deep snows , and , after their melting , the almost impassable roads , prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls , except to go to church ; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air .
our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold : we had no boots , the snow got into our shoes and melted there : our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains , as were our feet : i remember well the distracting irritation i endured from this cause every evening , when my feet inflamed ; and the torture of thrusting the swelled , raw , and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning .
then the scanty supply of food was distressing : with the keen appetites of growing children , we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid .
from this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse , which pressed hardly on the younger pupils : whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity , they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion .
many a time i have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time ; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee , i have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears , forced from me by the exigency of hunger .
sundays were dreary days in that wintry season .
we had to walk two miles to brocklebridge church , where our patron officiated .
we set out cold , we arrived at church colder : during the morning service we became almost paralysed .
it was too far to return to dinner , and an allowance of cold meat and bread , in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals , was served round between the services .
at the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road , where the bitter winter wind , blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north , almost flayed the skin from our faces .
i can remember miss temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line , her plaid cloak , which the frosty wind fluttered , gathered close about her , and encouraging us , by precept and example , to keep up our spirits , and march forward , as she said , " like stalwart soldiers . "
the other teachers , poor things , were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others .
how we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back !
but , to the little ones at least , this was denied : each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls , and behind them the younger children crouched in groups , wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores .
a little solace came at tea-time , in the shape of a double ration of bread--a whole , instead of a half , slice--with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter : it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from sabbath to sabbath .
i generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself ; but the remainder i was invariably obliged to part with .
the sunday evening was spent in repeating , by heart , the church catechism , and the fifth , sixth , and seventh chapters of st. matthew ; and in listening to a long sermon , read by miss miller , whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness .
a frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls , who , overpowered with sleep , would fall down , if not out of the third loft , yet off the fourth form , and be taken up half dead .
the remedy was , to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom , and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished . sometimes their feet failed them , and they sank together in a heap ; they were then propped up with the monitors ' high stools .
i have not yet alluded to the visits of mr. brocklehurst ; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival ; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon : his absence was a relief to me .
i need not say that i had my own reasons for dreading his coming : but come he did at last .
one afternoon ( i had then been three weeks at lowood ) , as i was sitting with a slate in my hand , puzzling over a sum in long division , my eyes , raised in abstraction to the window , caught sight of a figure just passing : i recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline ; and when , two minutes after , all the school , teachers included , rose _ en masse _ , it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted . a long stride measured the schoolroom , and presently beside miss temple , who herself had risen , stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of gateshead .
i now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture . yes , i was right : it was mr. brocklehurst , buttoned up in a surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .
i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition ; too well i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs. reed about my disposition , & c . ; the promise pledged by mr. brocklehurst to apprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature .
all along i had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise , --i had been looking out daily for the " coming man , " whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever : now there he was .
he stood at miss temple 's side ; he was speaking low in her ear : i did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy ; and i watched her eye with painful anxiety , expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt .
i listened too ; and as i happened to be seated quite at the top of the room , i caught most of what he said : its import relieved me from immediate apprehension .
" i suppose , miss temple , the thread i bought at lowton will do ; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises , and i sorted the needles to match .
you may tell miss smith that i forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles , but she shall have some papers sent in next week ; and she is not , on any account , to give out more than one at a time to each pupil : if they have more , they are apt to be careless and lose them .
and , o ma 'am ! i wish the woollen stockings were better looked to ! --when i was here last , i went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line ; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from the size of the holes in them i was sure they had not been well mended from time to time . "
he paused .
" your directions shall be attended to , sir , " said miss temple .
" and , ma 'am , " he continued , " the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week : it is too much ; the rules limit them to one . "
" i think i can explain that circumstance , sir .
agnes and catherine johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at lowton last thursday , and i gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion . "
mr. brocklehurst nodded .
" well , for once it may pass ; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often .
and there is another thing which surprised me ; i find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a lunch , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight . how is this ?
i looked over the regulations , and i find no such meal as lunch mentioned .
who introduced this innovation ? and by what authority ? "
" i must be responsible for the circumstance , sir , " replied miss temple : " the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it ; and i dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time . "
" madam , allow me an instant .
you are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self-denying .
should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur , such as the spoiling of a meal , the under or the over dressing of a dish , the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost , thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution ; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils , by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation .
a brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed , wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive christians ; to the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed lord himself , calling upon his disciples to take up their cross and follow him ; to his warnings that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god ; to his divine consolations , " if ye suffer hunger or thirst for my sake , happy are ye . "
oh , madam , when you put bread and cheese , instead of burnt porridge , into these children 's mouths , you may indeed feed their vile bodies , but you little think how you starve their immortal souls ! "
mr. brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings .
miss temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her ; but she now gazed straight before her , and her face , naturally pale as marble , appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material ; especially her mouth , closed as if it would have required a sculptor 's chisel to open it , and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity .
meantime , mr. brocklehurst , standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back , majestically surveyed the whole school .
suddenly his eye gave a blink , as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil ; turning , he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
" miss temple , miss temple , what-- _ what _ is that girl with curled hair ? red hair , ma 'am , curled--curled all over ? "
and extending his cane he pointed to the awful object , his hand shaking as he did so .
" it is julia severn , " replied miss temple , very quietly .
" julia severn , ma 'am ! and why has she , or any other , curled hair ?
why , in defiance of every precept and principle of this house , does she conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical , charitable establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls ? "
" julia 's hair curls naturally , " returned miss temple , still more quietly .
" naturally ! yes , but we are not to conform to nature ; i wish these girls to be the children of grace : and why that abundance ?
i have again and again intimated that i desire the hair to be arranged closely , modestly , plainly .
miss temple , that girl 's hair must be cut off entirely ; i will send a barber to-morrow : and i see others who have far too much of the excrescence--that tall girl , tell her to turn round .
tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall . "
miss temple passed her handkerchief over her lips , as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them ; she gave the order , however , and when the first class could take in what was required of them , they obeyed .
leaning a little back on my bench , i could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre : it was a pity mr. brocklehurst could not see them too ; he would perhaps have felt that , whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter , the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined .
he scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes , then pronounced sentence .
these words fell like the knell of doom--
" all those top-knots must be cut off . "
miss temple seemed to remonstrate .
" madam , " he pursued , " i have a master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety , not with braided hair and costly apparel ; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven ; these , i repeat , must be cut off ; think of the time wasted , of-- " mr. brocklehurst was here interrupted : three other visitors , ladies , now entered the room .
they ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress , for they were splendidly attired in velvet , silk , and furs .
the two younger of the trio ( fine girls of sixteen and seventeen ) had grey beaver hats , then in fashion , shaded with ostrich plumes , and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses , elaborately curled ; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl , trimmed with ermine , and she wore a false front of french curls .
these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple , as mrs. and the misses brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .
it seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative , and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs , while he transacted business with the housekeeper , questioned the laundress , and lectured the superintendent .
they now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to miss smith , who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories : but i had no time to listen to what they said ; other matters called off and enchanted my attention .
hitherto , while gathering up the discourse of mr. brocklehurst and miss temple , i had not , at the same time , neglected precautions to secure my personal safety ; which i thought would be effected , if i could only elude observation .
to this end , i had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : i might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ; i knew it was all over now , and , as i stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , i rallied my forces for the worst .
it came .
" a careless girl ! " said mr. brocklehurst , and immediately after-- " it is the new pupil , i perceive . " and before i could draw breath , " i must not forget i have a word to say respecting her . " then aloud : how loud it seemed to me !
" let the child who broke her slate come forward ! "
of my own accord i could not have stirred ; i was paralysed : but the two great girls who sit on each side of me , set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge , and then miss temple gently assisted me to his very feet , and i caught her whispered counsel--
" don 't be afraid , jane , i saw it was an accident ; you shall not be punished . "
the kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger .
" another minute , and she will despise me for a hypocrite , " thought i ; and an impulse of fury against reed , brocklehurst , and co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction . i was no helen burns .
" fetch that stool , " said mr. brocklehurst , pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen : it was brought .
" place the child upon it . "
and i was placed there , by whom i don 't know : i was in no condition to note particulars ; i was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of mr. brocklehurst 's nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me .
mr. brocklehurst hemmed . " ladies , " said he , turning to his family , " miss temple , teachers , and children , you all see this girl ? "
of course they did ; for i felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin .
" you see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; god has graciously given her the shape that he has given to all of us ; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character .
who would think that the evil one had already found a servant and agent in her ?
yet such , i grieve to say , is the case . "
a pause--in which i began to steady the palsy of my nerves , and to feel that the rubicon was passed ; and that the trial , no longer to be shirked , must be firmly sustained .
" my dear children , " pursued the black marble clergyman , with pathos , " this is a sad , a melancholy occasion ; for it becomes my duty to warn you , that this girl , who might be one of god 's own lambs , is a little castaway : not a member of the true flock , but evidently an interloper and an alien . you must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , avoid her company , exclude her from your sports , and shut her out from your converse .
teachers , you must watch her : keep your eyes on her movements , weigh well her words , scrutinise her actions , punish her body to save her soul : if , indeed , such salvation be possible , for ( my tongue falters while i tell it ) this girl , this child , the native of a christian land , worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to brahma and kneels before juggernaut--this girl is--a liar ! "
now came a pause of ten minutes , during which i , by this time in perfect possession of my wits , observed all the female brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics , while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro , and the two younger ones whispered , " how shocking ! "
mr. brocklehurst resumed . " this i learned from her benefactress ; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state , reared her as her own daughter , and whose kindness , whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad , so dreadful , that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones , fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has sent her here to be healed , even as the jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of bethesda ; and , teachers , superintendent , i beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her . "
with this sublime conclusion , mr. brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout , muttered something to his family , who rose , bowed to miss temple , and then all the great people sailed in state from the room .
turning at the door , my judge said--
" let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool , and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day . "
there was i , then , mounted aloft ; i , who had said i could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room , was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy .
what my sensations were no language can describe ; but just as they all rose , stifling my breath and constricting my throat , a girl came up and passed me : in passing , she lifted her eyes .
what a strange light inspired them ! what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! how the new feeling bore me up !
it was as if a martyr , a hero , had passed a slave or victim , and imparted strength in the transit .
i mastered the rising hysteria , lifted up my head , and took a firm stand on the stool .
helen burns asked some slight question about her work of miss smith , was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry , returned to her place , and smiled at me as she again went by .
what a smile !
i remember it now , and i know that it was the effluence of fine intellect , of true courage ; it lit up her marked lineaments , her thin face , her sunken grey eye , like a reflection from the aspect of an angel .
yet at that moment helen burns wore on her arm " the untidy badge ; " scarcely an hour ago i had heard her condemned by miss scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out .
chapter viii
ere the half-hour ended , five o 'clock struck ; school was dismissed , and all were gone into the refectory to tea .
i now ventured to descend : it was deep dusk ; i retired into a corner and sat down on the floor .
the spell by which i had been so far supported began to dissolve ; reaction took place , and soon , so overwhelming was the grief that seized me , i sank prostrate with my face to the ground .
now i wept : helen burns was not here ; nothing sustained me ; left to myself i abandoned myself , and my tears watered the boards .
i had meant to be so good , and to do so much at lowood : to make so many friends , to earn respect and win affection .
already i had made visible progress : that very morning i had reached the head of my class ; miss miller had praised me warmly ; miss temple had smiled approbation ; she had promised to teach me drawing , and to let me learn french , if i continued to make similar improvement two months longer : and then i was well received by my fellow-pupils ; treated as an equal by those of my own age , and not molested by any ; now , here i lay again crushed and trodden on ; and could i ever rise more ?
" never , " i thought ; and ardently i wished to die .
while sobbing out this wish in broken accents , some one approached : i started up--again helen burns was near me ; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long , vacant room ; she brought my coffee and bread .
" come , eat something , " she said ; but i put both away from me , feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition .
helen regarded me , probably with surprise : i could not now abate my agitation , though i tried hard ; i continued to weep aloud .
she sat down on the ground near me , embraced her knees with her arms , and rested her head upon them ; in that attitude she remained silent as an indian .
i was the first who spoke--
" helen , why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar ? "
" everybody , jane ?
why , there are only eighty people who have heard you called so , and the world contains hundreds of millions . "
" but what have i to do with millions ?
the eighty , i know , despise me . "
" jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you : many , i am sure , pity you much . "
" how can they pity me after what mr. brocklehurst has said ? "
" mr. brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great and admired man : he is little liked here ; he never took steps to make himself liked .
had he treated you as an especial favourite , you would have found enemies , declared or covert , all around you ; as it is , the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared .
teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two , but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts ; and if you persevere in doing well , these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression .
besides , jane " --she paused .
" well , helen ? " said i , putting my hand into hers : she chafed my fingers gently to warm them , and went on--
" if all the world hated you , and believed you wicked , while your own conscience approved you , and absolved you from guilt , you would not be without friends . "
" no ; i know i should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others don 't love me i would rather die than live--i cannot bear to be solitary and hated , helen .
look here ; to gain some real affection from you , or miss temple , or any other whom i truly love , i would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken , or to let a bull toss me , or to stand behind a kicking horse , and let it dash its hoof at my chest-- "
" hush , jane ! you think too much of the love of human beings ; you are too impulsive , too vehement ; the sovereign hand that created your frame , and put life into it , has provided you with other resources than your feeble self , or than creatures feeble as you .
besides this earth , and besides the race of men , there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits : that world is round us , for it is everywhere ; and those spirits watch us , for they are commissioned to guard us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame , if scorn smote us on all sides , and hatred crushed us , angels see our tortures , recognise our innocence ( if innocent we be : as i know you are of this charge which mr. brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from mrs. reed ; for i read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front ) , and god waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward .
why , then , should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress , when life is so soon over , and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory ? "
i was silent ; helen had calmed me ; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness .
i felt the impression of woe as she spoke , but i could not tell whence it came ; and when , having done speaking , she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough , i momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her .
resting my head on helen 's shoulder , i put my arms round her waist ; she drew me to her , and we reposed in silence . we had not sat long thus , when another person came in .
some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in through a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as miss temple .
" i came on purpose to find you , jane eyre , " said she ; " i want you in my room ; and as helen burns is with you , she may come too . "
we went ; following the superintendent 's guidance , we had to thread some intricate passages , and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment ; it contained a good fire , and looked cheerful .
miss temple told helen burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth , and herself taking another , she called me to her side .
" is it all over ? " she asked , looking down at my face . " have you cried your grief away ? "
" i am afraid i never shall do that . "
" why ? "
" because i have been wrongly accused ; and you , ma 'am , and everybody else , will now think me wicked . "
" we shall think you what you prove yourself to be , my child .
continue to act as a good girl , and you will satisfy us . "
" shall i , miss temple ? "
" you will , " said she , passing her arm round me . " and now tell me who is the lady whom mr. brocklehurst called your benefactress ? "
" mrs. reed , my uncle 's wife . my uncle is dead , and he left me to her care . "
" did she not , then , adopt you of her own accord ? "
" no , ma 'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle , as i have often heard the servants say , got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me . "
" well now , jane , you know , or at least i will tell you , that when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence .
you have been charged with falsehood ; defend yourself to me as well as you can . say whatever your memory suggests is true ; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing . "
i resolved , in the depth of my heart , that i would be most moderate--most correct ; and , having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what i had to say , i told her all the story of my sad childhood .
exhausted by emotion , my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme ; and mindful of helen 's warnings against the indulgence of resentment , i infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary . thus restrained and simplified , it sounded more credible : i felt as i went on that miss temple fully believed me .
in the course of the tale i had mentioned mr. lloyd as having come to see me after the fit : for i never forgot the , to me , frightful episode of the red-room : in detailing which , my excitement was sure , in some degree , to break bounds ; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when mrs. reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon , and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber .
i had finished : miss temple regarded me a few minutes in silence ; she then said--
" i know something of mr. lloyd ; i shall write to him ; if his reply agrees with your statement , you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation ; to me , jane , you are clear now . "
she kissed me , and still keeping me at her side ( where i was well contented to stand , for i derived a child 's pleasure from the contemplation of her face , her dress , her one or two ornaments , her white forehead , her clustered and shining curls , and beaming dark eyes ) , she proceeded to address helen burns .
" how are you to-night , helen ? have you coughed much to-day ? "
" not quite so much , i think , ma 'am . "
" and the pain in your chest ? "
" it is a little better . "
miss temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed it , i heard her sigh low .
she was pensive a few minutes , then rousing herself , she said cheerfully--
" but you two are my visitors to-night ; i must treat you as such . "
she rang her bell .
" barbara , " she said to the servant who answered it , " i have not yet had tea ; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies . "
and a tray was soon brought .
how pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright teapot look , placed on the little round table near the fire !
how fragrant was the steam of the beverage , and the scent of the toast ! of which , however , i , to my dismay ( for i was beginning to be hungry ) discerned only a very small portion : miss temple discerned it too .
" barbara , " said she , " can you not bring a little more bread and butter ? there is not enough for three . "
barbara went out : she returned soon--
" madam , mrs. harden says she has sent up the usual quantity . "
mrs. harden , be it observed , was the housekeeper : a woman after mr. brocklehurst 's own heart , made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron .
" oh , very well ! " returned miss temple ; " we must make it do , barbara , i suppose . "
and as the girl withdrew she added , smiling , " fortunately , i have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once . "
having invited helen and me to approach the table , and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast , she got up , unlocked a drawer , and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper , disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake .
" i meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , " said she , " but as there is so little toast , you must have it now , " and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand .
we feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia ; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us , as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied .
tea over and the tray removed , she again summoned us to the fire ; we sat one on each side of her , and now a conversation followed between her and helen , which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear .
miss temple had always something of serenity in her air , of state in her mien , of refined propriety in her language , which precluded deviation into the ardent , the excited , the eager : something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her , by a controlling sense of awe ; and such was my feeling now : but as to helen burns , i was struck with wonder .
the refreshing meal , the brilliant fire , the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress , or , perhaps , more than all these , something in her own unique mind , had roused her powers within her .
they woke , they kindled : first , they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek , which till this hour i had never seen but pale and bloodless ; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes , which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of miss temple 's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash , nor pencilled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .
then her soul sat on her lips , and language flowed , from what source i cannot tell .
has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough , vigorous enough , to hold the swelling spring of pure , full , fervid eloquence ? such was the characteristic of helen 's discourse on that , to me , memorable evening ; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence .
they conversed of things i had never heard of ; of nations and times past ; of countries far away ; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at : they spoke of books : how many they had read !
what stores of knowledge they possessed !
then they seemed so familiar with french names and french authors : but my amazement reached its climax when miss temple asked helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the latin her father had taught her , and taking a book from a shelf , bade her read and construe a page of virgil ; and helen obeyed , my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line .
she had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime ! no delay could be admitted ; miss temple embraced us both , saying , as she drew us to her heart--
" god bless you , my children ! "
helen she held a little longer than me : she let her go more reluctantly ; it was helen her eye followed to the door ; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh ; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek .
on reaching the bedroom , we heard the voice of miss scatcherd : she was examining drawers ; she had just pulled out helen burns 's , and when we entered helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand , and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder .
" my things were indeed in shameful disorder , " murmured helen to me , in a low voice : " i intended to have arranged them , but i forgot . "
next morning , miss scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word " slattern , " and bound it like a phylactery round helen 's large , mild , intelligent , and benign-looking forehead .
she wore it till evening , patient , unresentful , regarding it as a deserved punishment .
the moment miss scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , i ran to helen , tore it off , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .
about a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated , miss temple , who had written to mr. lloyd , received his answer : it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account .
miss temple , having assembled the whole school , announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against jane eyre , and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation . the teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me , and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions .
thus relieved of a grievous load , i from that hour set to work afresh , resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty : i toiled hard , and my success was proportionate to my efforts ; my memory , not naturally tenacious , improved with practice ; exercise sharpened my wits ; in a few weeks i was promoted to a higher class ; in less than two months i was allowed to commence french and drawing .
i learned the first two tenses of the verb _ etre _ , and sketched my first cottage ( whose walls , by-the- bye , outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of pisa ) , on the same day .
that night , on going to bed , i forgot to prepare in imagination the barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes , or white bread and new milk , with which i was wont to amuse my inward cravings : i feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings , which i saw in the dark ; all the work of my own hands : freely pencilled houses and trees , picturesque rocks and ruins , cuyp-like groups of cattle , sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses , of birds picking at ripe cherries , of wren 's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs , wreathed about with young ivy sprays .
i examined , too , in thought , the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little french story which madame pierrot had that day shown me ; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere i fell sweetly asleep .
well has solomon said-- " better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . "
i would not now have exchanged lowood with all its privations for gateshead and its daily luxuries .
chapter ix
but the privations , or rather the hardships , of lowood lessened .
spring drew on : she was indeed already come ; the frosts of winter had ceased ; its snows were melted , its cutting winds ameliorated .
my wretched feet , flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of january , began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of april ; the nights and mornings no longer by their canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins ; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden : sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial , and a greenness grew over those brown beds , which , freshening daily , suggested the thought that hope traversed them at night , and left each morning brighter traces of her steps .
flowers peeped out amongst the leaves ; snow-drops , crocuses , purple auriculas , and golden-eyed pansies .
on thursday afternoons ( half-holidays ) we now took walks , and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside , under the hedges .
i discovered , too , that a great pleasure , an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded , lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden : this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow , rich in verdure and shadow ; in a bright beck , full of dark stones and sparkling eddies .
how different had this scene looked when i viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter , stiffened in frost , shrouded with snow ! --when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks , and rolled down " ing " and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck !
that beck itself was then a torrent , turbid and curbless : it tore asunder the wood , and sent a raving sound through the air , often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet ; and for the forest on its banks , _ that _ showed only ranks of skeletons .
april advanced to may : a bright serene may it was ; days of blue sky , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .
and now vegetation matured with vigour ; lowood shook loose its tresses ; it became all green , all flowery ; its great elm , ash , and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life ; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses ; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows , and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : i have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre .
all this i enjoyed often and fully , free , unwatched , and almost alone : for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause , to which it now becomes my task to advert .
have i not described a pleasant site for a dwelling , when i speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood , and rising from the verge of a stream ?
assuredly , pleasant enough : but whether healthy or not is another question .
that forest-dell , where lowood lay , was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence ; which , quickening with the quickening spring , crept into the orphan asylum , breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory , and , ere may arrived , transformed the seminary into an hospital .
semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection : forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time .
classes were broken up , rules relaxed .
the few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license ; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health : and had it been otherwise , no one had leisure to watch or restrain them .
miss temple 's whole attention was absorbed by the patients : she lived in the sick-room , never quitting it except to snatch a few hours ' rest at night . the teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion .
many , already smitten , went home only to die : some died at the school , and were buried quietly and quickly , the nature of the malady forbidding delay .
while disease had thus become an inhabitant of lowood , and death its frequent visitor ; while there was gloom and fear within its walls ; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells , the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality , that bright may shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors .
its garden , too , glowed with flowers : hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees , lilies had opened , tulips and roses were in bloom ; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies ; the sweetbriars gave out , morning and evening , their scent of spice and apples ; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of lowood , except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin .
but i , and the rest who continued well , enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season ; they let us ramble in the wood , like gipsies , from morning till night ; we did what we liked , went where we liked : we lived better too .
mr. brocklehurst and his family never came near lowood now : household matters were not scrutinised into ; the cross housekeeper was gone , driven away by the fear of infection ; her successor , who had been matron at the lowton dispensary , unused to the ways of her new abode , provided with comparative liberality .
besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast-basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a large piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .
my favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone , rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck , and only to be got at by wading through the water ; a feat i accomplished barefoot .
the stone was just broad enough to accommodate , comfortably , another girl and me , at that time my chosen comrade--one mary ann wilson ; a shrewd , observant personage , whose society i took pleasure in , partly because she was witty and original , and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease .
some years older than i , she knew more of the world , and could tell me many things i liked to hear : with her my curiosity found gratification : to my faults also she gave ample indulgence , never imposing curb or rein on anything i said .
she had a turn for narrative , i for analysis ; she liked to inform , i to question ; so we got on swimmingly together , deriving much entertainment , if not much improvement , from our mutual intercourse .
and where , meantime , was helen burns ?
why did i not spend these sweet days of liberty with her ?
had i forgotten her ? or was i so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society ?
surely the mary ann wilson i have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance : she could only tell me amusing stories , and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip i chose to indulge in ; while , if i have spoken truth of helen , she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things .
true , reader ; and i knew and felt this : and though i am a defective being , with many faults and few redeeming points , yet i never tired of helen burns ; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment , as strong , tender , and respectful as any that ever animated my heart .
how could it be otherwise , when helen , at all times and under all circumstances , evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship , which ill-humour never soured , nor irritation never troubled ?
but helen was ill at present : for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to i knew not what room upstairs .
she was not , i was told , in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients ; for her complaint was consumption , not typhus : and by consumption i , in my ignorance , understood something mild , which time and care would be sure to alleviate .
i was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons , and being taken by miss temple into the garden ; but , on these occasions , i was not allowed to go and speak to her ; i only saw her from the schoolroom window , and then not distinctly ; for she was much wrapped up , and sat at a distance under the verandah .
one evening , in the beginning of june , i had stayed out very late with mary ann in the wood ; we had , as usual , separated ourselves from the others , and had wandered far ; so far that we lost our way , and had to ask it at a lonely cottage , where a man and woman lived , who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood .
when we got back , it was after moonrise : a pony , which we knew to be the surgeon 's , was standing at the garden door . mary ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill , as mr. bates had been sent for at that time of the evening .
she went into the house ; i stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots i had dug up in the forest , and which i feared would wither if i left them till the morning .
this done , i lingered yet a little longer : the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell ; it was such a pleasant evening , so serene , so warm ; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow ; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east .
i was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might , when it entered my mind as it had never done before : --
" how sad to be lying now on a sick bed , and to be in danger of dying !
this world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it , and to have to go who knows where ? "
and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood--the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .
while pondering this new idea , i heard the front door open ; mr. bates came out , and with him was a nurse .
after she had seen him mount his horse and depart , she was about to close the door , but i ran up to her .
" how is helen burns ? "
" very poorly , " was the answer .
" is it her mr. bates has been to see ? "
" yes . "
" and what does he say about her ? "
" he says she 'll not be here long . "
this phrase , uttered in my hearing yesterday , would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to northumberland , to her own home . i should not have suspected that it meant she was dying ; but i knew instantly now !
it opened clear on my comprehension that helen burns was numbering her last days in this world , and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits , if such region there were .
i experienced a shock of horror , then a strong thrill of grief , then a desire--a necessity to see her ; and i asked in what room she lay .
" she is in miss temple 's room , " said the nurse .
" may i go up and speak to her ? "
" oh no , child ! it is not likely ; and now it is time for you to come in ; you 'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling . "
the nurse closed the front door ; i went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom : i was just in time ; it was nine o 'clock , and miss miller was calling the pupils to go to bed .
it might be two hours later , probably near eleven , when i--not having been able to fall asleep , and deeming , from the perfect silence of the dormitory , that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose softly , put on my frock over my night-dress , and , without shoes , crept from the apartment , and set off in quest of miss temple 's room .
it was quite at the other end of the house ; but i knew my way ; and the light of the unclouded summer moon , entering here and there at passage windows , enabled me to find it without difficulty .
an odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came near the fever room : and i passed its door quickly , fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me .
i dreaded being discovered and sent back ; for i _ must _ see helen , --i must embrace her before she died , --i must give her one last kiss , exchange with her one last word .
having descended a staircase , traversed a portion of the house below , and succeeded in opening and shutting , without noise , two doors , i reached another flight of steps ; these i mounted , and then just opposite to me was miss temple 's room .
a light shone through the keyhole and from under the door ; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity .
coming near , i found the door slightly ajar ; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness .
indisposed to hesitate , and full of impatient impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--i put it back and looked in .
my eye sought helen , and feared to find death . close by miss temple 's bed , and half covered with its white curtains , there stood a little crib .
i saw the outline of a form under the clothes , but the face was hid by the hangings : the nurse i had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep ; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table .
miss temple was not to be seen : i knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room .
i advanced ; then paused by the crib side : my hand was on the curtain , but i preferred speaking before i withdrew it . i still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse .
" helen ! " i whispered softly , " are you awake ? "
she stirred herself , put back the curtain , and i saw her face , pale , wasted , but quite composed : she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated .
" can it be you , jane ? " she asked , in her own gentle voice .
" oh ! " i thought , " she is not going to die ; they are mistaken : she could not speak and look so calmly if she were . "
i got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was cold , and her cheek both cold and thin , and so were her hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old .
" why are you come here , jane ? it is past eleven o 'clock : i heard it strike some minutes since . "
" i came to see you , helen : i heard you were very ill , and i could not sleep till i had spoken to you . "
" you came to bid me good-bye , then : you are just in time probably . "
" are you going somewhere , helen ? are you going home ? "
" yes ; to my long home--my last home . "
" no , no , helen ! "
i stopped , distressed .
while i tried to devour my tears , a fit of coughing seized helen ; it did not , however , wake the nurse ; when it was over , she lay some minutes exhausted ; then she whispered--
" jane , your little feet are bare ; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt . "
i did so : she put her arm over me , and i nestled close to her .
after a long silence , she resumed , still whispering--
" i am very happy , jane ; and when you hear that i am dead , you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to grieve about . we all must die one day , and the illness which is removing me is not painful ; it is gentle and gradual : my mind is at rest .
i leave no one to regret me much : i have only a father ; and he is lately married , and will not miss me .
by dying young , i shall escape great sufferings . i had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world : i should have been continually at fault . "
" but where are you going to , helen ?
can you see ? do you know ? "
" i believe ; i have faith : i am going to god . "
" where is god ?
what is god ? "
" my maker and yours , who will never destroy what he created . i rely implicitly on his power , and confide wholly in his goodness : i count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to him , reveal him to me . "
" you are sure , then , helen , that there is such a place as heaven , and that our souls can get to it when we die ? "
" i am sure there is a future state ; i believe god is good ; i can resign my immortal part to him without any misgiving .
god is my father ; god is my friend : i love him ; i believe he loves me . "
" and shall i see you again , helen , when i die ? "
" you will come to the same region of happiness : be received by the same mighty , universal parent , no doubt , dear jane . "
again i questioned , but this time only in thought . " where is that region ? does it exist ? "
and i clasped my arms closer round helen ; she seemed dearer to me than ever ; i felt as if i could not let her go ; i lay with my face hidden on her neck .
presently she said , in the sweetest tone--
" how comfortable i am ! that last fit of coughing has tired me a little ; i feel as if i could sleep : but don 't leave me , jane ; i like to have you near me . "
" i 'll stay with you , _ dear _ helen : no one shall take me away . "
" are you warm , darling ? "
" yes . "
" good-night , jane . "
" good-night , helen . "
she kissed me , and i her , and we both soon slumbered .
when i awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ; i looked up ; i was in somebody 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory .
i was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards i learned that miss temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against helen burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .
i was asleep , and helen was--dead .
her grave is in brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word " resurgam . "
chapter x
hitherto i have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence : to the first ten years of my life i have given almost as many chapters . but this is not to be a regular autobiography . i am only bound to invoke memory where i know her responses will possess some degree of interest ; therefore i now pass a space of eight years almost in silence : a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection .
when the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at lowood , it gradually disappeared from thence ; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school .
inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge , and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree . the unhealthy nature of the site ; the quantity and quality of the children 's food ; the brackish , fetid water used in its preparation ; the pupils ' wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered , and the discovery produced a result mortifying to mr. brocklehurst , but beneficial to the institution .
several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation ; new regulations were made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee .
mr. brocklehurst , who , from his wealth and family connections , could not be overlooked , still retained the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds : his office of inspector , too , was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness , comfort with economy , compassion with uprightness .
the school , thus improved , became in time a truly useful and noble institution .
i remained an inmate of its walls , after its regeneration , for eight years : six as pupil , and two as teacher ; and in both capacities i bear my testimony to its value and importance .
during these eight years my life was uniform : but not unhappy , because it was not inactive .
i had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as i loved , urged me on : i availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
in time i rose to be the first girl of the first class ; then i was invested with the office of teacher ; which i discharged with zeal for two years : but at the end of that time i altered .
miss temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction i owed the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion .
at this period she married , removed with her husband ( a clergyman , an excellent man , almost worthy of such a wife ) to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me .
from the day she left i was no longer the same : with her was gone every settled feeling , every association that had made lowood in some degree a home to me .
i had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more harmonious thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind . i had given in allegiance to duty and order ; i was quiet ; i believed i was content : to the eyes of others , usually even to my own , i appeared a disciplined and subdued character .
but destiny , in the shape of the rev. mr. nasmyth , came between me and miss temple : i saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise , shortly after the marriage ceremony ; i watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow ; and then retired to my own room , and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion .
i walked about the chamber most of the time .
i imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and i looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval i had undergone a transforming process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of miss temple--or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere i had been breathing in her vicinity--and that now i was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions .
it did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn , but rather as if a motive were gone : it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me , but the reason for tranquillity was no more .
my world had for some years been in lowood : my experience had been of its rules and systems ; now i remembered that the real world was wide , and that a varied field of hopes and fears , of sensations and excitements , awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse , to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils .
i went to my window , opened it , and looked out . there were the two wings of the building ; there was the garden ; there were the skirts of lowood ; there was the hilly horizon .
my eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote , the blue peaks ; it was those i longed to surmount ; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground , exile limits .
i traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and vanishing in a gorge between two ; how i longed to follow it farther !
i recalled the time when i had travelled that very road in a coach ; i remembered descending that hill at twilight ; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to lowood , and i had never quitted it since .
my vacations had all been spent at school : mrs. reed had never sent for me to gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me .
i had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world : school-rules , school-duties , school-habits and notions , and voices , and faces , and phrases , and costumes , and preferences , and antipathies--such was what i knew of existence .
and now i felt that it was not enough ; i tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon . i desired liberty ; for liberty i gasped ; for liberty i uttered a prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing .
i abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication ; for change , stimulus : that petition , too , seemed swept off into vague space : " then , " i cried , half desperate , " grant me at least a new servitude ! "
here a bell , ringing the hour of supper , called me downstairs .
i was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which i longed to recur , by a prolonged effusion of small talk .
how i wished sleep would silence her . it seemed as if , could i but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as i stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief .
miss gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to-night i hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; i was debarrassed of interruption ; my half-effaced thought instantly revived .
" a new servitude !
there is something in that , " i soliloquised ( mentally , be it understood ; i did not talk aloud ) , " i know there is , because it does not sound too sweet ; it is not like such words as liberty , excitement , enjoyment : delightful sounds truly ; but no more than sounds for me ; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them .
but servitude ! that must be matter of fact .
any one may serve : i have served here eight years ; now all i want is to serve elsewhere . can i not get so much of my own will ? is not the thing feasible ?
yes--yes--the end is not so difficult ; if i had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it . "
i sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; i covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then i proceeded _ to think _ again with all my might .
" what do i want ?
a new place , in a new house , amongst new faces , under new circumstances : i want this because it is of no use wanting anything better .
how do people do to get a new place ?
they apply to friends , i suppose : i have no friends .
there are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? "
i could not tell : nothing answered me ; i then ordered my brain to find a response , and quickly .
it worked and worked faster : i felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts .
feverish with vain labour , i got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .
a kind fairy , in my absence , had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow ; for as i lay down , it came quietly and naturally to my mind.-- " those who want situations advertise ; you must advertise in the _ ---shire herald _ . "
" how ?
i know nothing about advertising . "
replies rose smooth and prompt now : --
" you must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the _ herald _ ; you must put it , the first opportunity you have , into the post at lowton ; answers must be addressed to j.e. , at the post-office there ; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter , if any are come , and act accordingly . "
this scheme i went over twice , thrice ; it was then digested in my mind ; i had it in a clear practical form : i felt satisfied , and fell asleep .
with earliest day , i was up : i had my advertisement written , enclosed , and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus : --
" a young lady accustomed to tuition " ( had i not been a teacher two years ? ) " is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen ( i thought that as i was barely eighteen , it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age ) .
she is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good english education , together with french , drawing , and music " ( in those days , reader , this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments , would have been held tolerably comprehensive ) .
" address , j.e. , post-office , lowton , --- shire . "
this document remained locked in my drawer all day : after tea , i asked leave of the new superintendent to go to lowton , in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers ; permission was readily granted ; i went .
it was a walk of two miles , and the evening was wet , but the days were still long ; i visited a shop or two , slipped the letter into the post-office , and came back through heavy rain , with streaming garments , but with a relieved heart .
the succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end at last , however , like all sublunary things , and once more , towards the close of a pleasant autumn day , i found myself afoot on the road to lowton .
a picturesque track it was , by the way ; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale : but that day i thought more of the letters , that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither i was bound , than of the charms of lea and water .
my ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes ; so i discharged that business first , and when it was done , i stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker 's to the post-office : it was kept by an old dame , who wore horn spectacles on her nose , and black mittens on her hands .
" are there any letters for j.e. ? " i asked .
she peered at me over her spectacles , and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time , so long that my hopes began to falter . at last , having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes , she presented it across the counter , accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for j.e .
" is there only one ? " i demanded .
" there are no more , " said she ; and i put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward : i could not open it then ; rules obliged me to be back by eight , and it was already half-past seven .
various duties awaited me on my arrival . i had to sit with the girls during their hour of study ; then it was my turn to read prayers ; to see them to bed : afterwards i supped with the other teachers .
even when we finally retired for the night , the inevitable miss gryce was still my companion : we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick , and i dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out ; fortunately , however , the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect : she was already snoring before i had finished undressing .
there still remained an inch of candle : i now took out my letter ; the seal was an initial f. ; i broke it ; the contents were brief .
" if j.e. , who advertised in the _ ---shire herald _ of last thursday , possesses the acquirements mentioned , and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency , a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil , a little girl , under ten years of age ; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum .
j.e. is requested to send references , name , address , and all particulars to the direction : -- " mrs. fairfax , thornfield , near millcote , ---shire . "
i examined the document long : the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain , like that of an elderly lady .
this circumstance was satisfactory : a private fear had haunted me , that in thus acting for myself , and by my own guidance , i ran the risk of getting into some scrape ; and , above all things , i wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable , proper , _ en regle _ .
i now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business i had on hand .
mrs. fairfax ! i saw her in a black gown and widow 's cap ; frigid , perhaps , but not uncivil : a model of elderly english respectability .
thornfield ! that , doubtless , was the name of her house : a neat orderly spot , i was sure ; though i failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises .
millcote , ---shire ; i brushed up my recollections of the map of england , yes , i saw it ; both the shire and the town . ---shire was seventy miles nearer london than the remote county where i now resided : that was a recommendation to me .
i longed to go where there was life and movement : millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the a- ; a busy place enough , doubtless : so much the better ; it would be a complete change at least .
not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke-- " but , " i argued , " thornfield will , probably , be a good way from the town . "
here the socket of the candle dropped , and the wick went out .
next day new steps were to be taken ; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast ; i must impart them in order to achieve their success .
having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation , i told her i had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what i now received ( for at lowood i only got 15 pounds per annum ) ; and requested she would break the matter for me to mr. brocklehurst , or some of the committee , and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references .
she obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter . the next day she laid the affair before mr. brocklehurst , who said that mrs. reed must be written to , as she was my natural guardian .
a note was accordingly addressed to that lady , who returned for answer , that " i might do as i pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . "
this note went the round of the committee , and at last , after what appeared to me most tedious delay , formal leave was given me to better my condition if i could ; and an assurance added , that as i had always conducted myself well , both as teacher and pupil , at lowood , a testimonial of character and capacity , signed by the inspectors of that institution , should forthwith be furnished me .
this testimonial i accordingly received in about a month , forwarded a copy of it to mrs. fairfax , and got that lady 's reply , stating that she was satisfied , and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house .
i now busied myself in preparations : the fortnight passed rapidly . i had not a very large wardrobe , though it was adequate to my wants ; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk , --the same i had brought with me eight years ago from gateshead .
the box was corded , the card nailed on . in half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to lowton , whither i myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach .
i had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress , prepared my bonnet , gloves , and muff ; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind ; and now having nothing more to do , i sat down and tried to rest .
i could not ; though i had been on foot all day , i could not now repose an instant ; i was too much excited .
a phase of my life was closing to-night , a new one opening to-morrow : impossible to slumber in the interval ; i must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished .
" miss , " said a servant who met me in the lobby , where i was wandering like a troubled spirit , " a person below wishes to see you . "
" the carrier , no doubt , " i thought , and ran downstairs without inquiry .
i was passing the back-parlour or teachers ' sitting-room , the door of which was half open , to go to the kitchen , when some one ran out--
" it 's her , i am sure ! --i could have told her anywhere ! " cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand .
i looked : i saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant , matronly , yet still young ; very good-looking , with black hair and eyes , and lively complexion .
" well , who is it ? " she asked , in a voice and with a smile i half recognised ; " you 've not quite forgotten me , i think , miss jane ? "
in another second i was embracing and kissing her rapturously : " bessie !
bessie !
bessie ! " that was all i said ; whereat she half laughed , half cried , and we both went into the parlour .
by the fire stood a little fellow of three years old , in plaid frock and trousers .
" that is my little boy , " said bessie directly .
" then you are married , bessie ? "
" yes ; nearly five years since to robert leaven , the coachman ; and i 've a little girl besides bobby there , that i 've christened jane . "
" and you don 't live at gateshead ? "
" i live at the lodge : the old porter has left . "
" well , and how do they all get on ?
tell me everything about them , bessie : but sit down first ; and , bobby , come and sit on my knee , will you ? " but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother .
" you 're not grown so very tall , miss jane , nor so very stout , " continued mrs. leaven .
" i dare say they 've not kept you too well at school : miss reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are ; and miss georgiana would make two of you in breadth . "
" georgiana is handsome , i suppose , bessie ? "
" very .
she went up to london last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were against the match ; and--what do you think ? --he and miss georgiana made it up to run away ; but they were found out and stopped .
it was miss reed that found them out : i believe she was envious ; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together ; they are always quarrelling-- "
" well , and what of john reed ? "
" oh , he is not doing so well as his mama could wish . he went to college , and he got--plucked , i think they call it : and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister , and study the law : but he is such a dissipated young man , they will never make much of him , i think . "
" what does he look like ? "
" he is very tall : some people call him a fine-looking young man ; but he has such thick lips . "
" and mrs. reed ? "
" missis looks stout and well enough in the face , but i think she 's not quite easy in her mind : mr. john 's conduct does not please her--he spends a deal of money . "
" did she send you here , bessie ? "
" no , indeed : but i have long wanted to see you , and when i heard that there had been a letter from you , and that you were going to another part of the country , i thought i 'd just set off , and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach . "
" i am afraid you are disappointed in me , bessie . "
i said this laughing : i perceived that bessie 's glance , though it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .
" no , miss jane , not exactly : you are genteel enough ; you look like a lady , and it is as much as ever i expected of you : you were no beauty as a child . "
i smiled at bessie 's frank answer : i felt that it was correct , but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import : at eighteen most people wish to please , and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification .
" i dare say you are clever , though , " continued bessie , by way of solace . " what can you do ? can you play on the piano ? "
" a little . "
there was one in the room ; bessie went and opened it , and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune :
i played a waltz or two , and she was charmed .
" the miss reeds could not play as well ! " said she exultingly . " i always said you would surpass them in learning : and can you draw ? "
" that is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece . "
it was a landscape in water colours , of which i had made a present to the superintendent , in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf , and which she had framed and glazed .
" well , that is beautiful , miss jane ! it is as fine a picture as any miss reed 's drawing-master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt french ? "
" yes , bessie , i can both read it and speak it . "
" and you can work on muslin and canvas ? "
" i can . "
" oh , you are quite a lady , miss jane ! i knew you would be : you will get on whether your relations notice you or not .
there was something i wanted to ask you . have you ever heard anything from your father 's kinsfolk , the eyres ? "
" never in my life . "
" well , you know missis always said they were poor and quite despicable : and they may be poor ; but i believe they are as much gentry as the reeds are ; for one day , nearly seven years ago , a mr. eyre came to gateshead and wanted to see you ; missis said you were at school fifty miles off ; he seemed so much disappointed , for he could not stay : he was going on a voyage to a foreign country , and the ship was to sail from london in a day or two .
he looked quite a gentleman , and i believe he was your father 's brother . "
" what foreign country was he going to , bessie ? "
" an island thousands of miles off , where they make wine--the butler did tell me-- "
" madeira ? " i suggested .
" yes , that is it--that is the very word . "
" so he went ? "
" yes ; he did not stay many minutes in the house : missis was very high with him ; she called him afterwards a ' sneaking tradesman . '
my robert believes he was a wine-merchant . "
" very likely , " i returned ; " or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant . "
bessie and i conversed about old times an hour longer , and then she was obliged to leave me : i saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at lowton , while i was waiting for the coach .
we parted finally at the door of the brocklehurst arms there : each went her separate way ; she set off for the brow of lowood fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to gateshead , i mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of millcote .
chapter xi
a new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play ; and when i draw up the curtain this time , reader , you must fancy you see a room in the george inn at millcote , with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have ; such a carpet , such furniture , such ornaments on the mantelpiece , such prints , including a portrait of george the third , and another of the prince of wales , and a representation of the death of wolfe .
all this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling , and by that of an excellent fire , near which i sit in my cloak and bonnet ; my muff and umbrella lie on the table , and i am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours ' exposure to the rawness of an october day : i left lowton at four o 'clock a.m. , and the millcote town clock is now just striking eight .
reader , though i look comfortably accommodated , i am not very tranquil in my mind .
i thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me ; i looked anxiously round as i descended the wooden steps the " boots " placed for my convenience , expecting to hear my name pronounced , and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to thornfield .
nothing of the sort was visible ; and when i asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a miss eyre , i was answered in the negative : so i had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room : and here i am waiting , while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts .
it is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world , cut adrift from every connection , uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached , and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted .
the charm of adventure sweetens that sensation , the glow of pride warms it ; but then the throb of fear disturbs it ; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still i was alone .
i bethought myself to ring the bell .
" is there a place in this neighbourhood called thornfield ? " i asked of the waiter who answered the summons .
" thornfield ?
i don 't know , ma 'am ; i 'll inquire at the bar . "
he vanished , but reappeared instantly--
" is your name eyre , miss ? "
" yes . "
" person here waiting for you . "
i jumped up , took my muff and umbrella , and hastened into the inn-passage : a man was standing by the open door , and in the lamp-lit street i dimly saw a one-horse conveyance .
" this will be your luggage , i suppose ? " said the man rather abruptly when he saw me , pointing to my trunk in the passage .
" yes . "
he hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then i got in ; before he shut me up , i asked him how far it was to thornfield .
" a matter of six miles . "
" how long shall we be before we get there ? "
" happen an hour and a half . "
he fastened the car door , climbed to his own seat outside , and we set off .
our progress was leisurely , and gave me ample time to reflect ; i was content to be at length so near the end of my journey ; and as i leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance , i meditated much at my ease .
" i suppose , " thought i , " judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , mrs. fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ; i never lived amongst fine people but once , and i was very miserable with them .
i wonder if she lives alone except this little girl ; if so , and if she is in any degree amiable , i shall surely be able to get on with her ; i will do my best ; it is a pity that doing one 's best does not always answer .
at lowood , indeed , i took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in pleasing ; but with mrs. reed , i remember my best was always spurned with scorn .
i pray god mrs. fairfax may not turn out a second mrs. reed ; but if she does , i am not bound to stay with her ! let the worst come to the worst , i can advertise again .
how far are we on our road now , i wonder ? "
i let down the window and looked out ; millcote was behind us ; judging by the number of its lights , it seemed a place of considerable magnitude , much larger than lowton . we were now , as far as i could see , on a sort of common ; but there were houses scattered all over the district ; i felt we were in a different region to lowood , more populous , less picturesque ; more stirring , less romantic .
the roads were heavy , the night misty ; my conductor let his horse walk all the way , and the hour and a half extended , i verily believe , to two hours ; at last he turned in his seat and said--
" you 're noan so far fro ' thornfield now . "
again i looked out : we were passing a church ; i saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; i saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .
about ten minutes after , the driver got down and opened a pair of gates : we passed through , and they clashed to behind us .
we now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a house : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window ; all the rest were dark .
the car stopped at the front door ; it was opened by a maid-servant ; i alighted and went in .
" will you walk this way , ma 'am ? " said the girl ; and i followed her across a square hall with high doors all round : she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me , contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured ; when i could see , however , a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view .
a snug small room ; a round table by a cheerful fire ; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned , wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady , in widow 's cap , black silk gown , and snowy muslin apron ; exactly like what i had fancied mrs. fairfax , only less stately and milder looking .
she was occupied in knitting ; a large cat sat demurely at her feet ; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort .
a more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived ; there was no grandeur to overwhelm , no stateliness to embarrass ; and then , as i entered , the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me .
" how do you do , my dear ? i am afraid you have had a tedious ride ; john drives so slowly ; you must be cold , come to the fire . "
" mrs. fairfax , i suppose ? " said i .
" yes , you are right : do sit down . "
she conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings ; i begged she would not give herself so much trouble .
" oh , it is no trouble ; i dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold . leah , make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two : here are the keys of the storeroom . "
and she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys , and delivered them to the servant .
" now , then , draw nearer to the fire , " she continued .
" you 've brought your luggage with you , haven 't you , my dear ? "
" yes , ma 'am . "
" i 'll see it carried into your room , " she said , and bustled out .
" she treats me like a visitor , " thought i .
" i little expected such a reception ; i anticipated only coldness and stiffness : this is not like what i have heard of the treatment of governesses ; but i must not exult too soon . "
she returned ; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table , to make room for the tray which leah now brought , and then herself handed me the refreshments .
i felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than i had ever before received , and , that too , shown by my employer and superior ; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place , i thought it better to take her civilities quietly .
" shall i have the pleasure of seeing miss fairfax to-night ? " i asked , when i had partaken of what she offered me .
" what did you say , my dear ? i am a little deaf , " returned the good lady , approaching her ear to my mouth .
i repeated the question more distinctly .
" miss fairfax ?
oh , you mean miss varens !
varens is the name of your future pupil . "
" indeed !
then she is not your daughter ? "
" no , --i have no family . "
i should have followed up my first inquiry , by asking in what way miss varens was connected with her ; but i recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions : besides , i was sure to hear in time .
" i am so glad , " she continued , as she sat down opposite to me , and took the cat on her knee ; " i am so glad you are come ; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion .
to be sure it is pleasant at any time ; for thornfield is a fine old hall , rather neglected of late years perhaps , but still it is a respectable place ; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters .
i say alone--leah is a nice girl to be sure , and john and his wife are very decent people ; but then you see they are only servants , and one can 't converse with them on terms of equality : one must keep them at due distance , for fear of losing one 's authority .
i 'm sure last winter ( it was a very severe one , if you recollect , and when it did not snow , it rained and blew ) , not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house , from november till february ; and i really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone ; i had leah in to read to me sometimes ; but i don 't think the poor girl liked the task much : she felt it confining .
in spring and summer one got on better : sunshine and long days make such a difference ; and then , just at the commencement of this autumn , little adela varens came and her nurse : a child makes a house alive all at once ; and now you are here i shall be quite gay . "
my heart really warmed to the worthy lady as i heard her talk ; and i drew my chair a little nearer to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .
" but i 'll not keep you sitting up late to-night , " said she ; " it is on the stroke of twelve now , and you have been travelling all day : you must feel tired .
if you have got your feet well warmed , i 'll show you your bedroom . i 've had the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small apartment , but i thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer furniture , but they are so dreary and solitary , i never sleep in them myself . "
i thanked her for her considerate choice , and as i really felt fatigued with my long journey , expressed my readiness to retire .
she took her candle , and i followed her from the room .
first she went to see if the hall-door was fastened ; having taken the key from the lock , she led the way upstairs .
the steps and banisters were of oak ; the staircase window was high and latticed ; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house .
a very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery , suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude ; and i was glad , when finally ushered into my chamber , to find it of small dimensions , and furnished in ordinary , modern style .
when mrs. fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night , and i had fastened my door , gazed leisurely round , and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall , that dark and spacious staircase , and that long , cold gallery , by the livelier aspect of my little room , i remembered that , after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety , i was now at last in safe haven .
the impulse of gratitude swelled my heart , and i knelt down at the bedside , and offered up thanks where thanks were due ; not forgetting , ere i rose , to implore aid on my further path , and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned .
my couch had no thorns in it that night ; my solitary room no fears .
at once weary and content , i slept soon and soundly : when i awoke it was broad day .
the chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains , showing papered walls and a carpeted floor , so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of lowood , that my spirits rose at the view .
externals have a great effect on the young : i thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me , one that was to have its flowers and pleasures , as well as its thorns and toils .
my faculties , roused by the change of scene , the new field offered to hope , seemed all astir . i cannot precisely define what they expected , but it was something pleasant : not perhaps that day or that month , but at an indefinite future period .
i rose ; i dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain--for i had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--i was still by nature solicitous to be neat .
it was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression i made : on the contrary , i ever wished to look as well as i could , and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit .
i sometimes regretted that i was not handsomer ; i sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks , a straight nose , and small cherry mouth ; i desired to be tall , stately , and finely developed in figure ; i felt it a misfortune that i was so little , so pale , and had features so irregular and so marked .
and why had i these aspirations and these regrets ?
it would be difficult to say : i could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet i had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
however , when i had brushed my hair very smooth , and put on my black frock--which , quakerlike as it was , at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker , i thought i should do respectably enough to appear before mrs. fairfax , and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy .
having opened my chamber window , and seen that i left all things straight and neat on the toilet table , i ventured forth .
traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .
everything appeared very stately and imposing to me ; but then i was so little accustomed to grandeur .
the hall-door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .
it was a fine autumn morning ; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields ; advancing on to the lawn , i looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion .
it was three storeys high , of proportions not vast , though considerable : a gentleman 's manor-house , not a nobleman 's seat : battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look .
its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery , whose cawing tenants were now on the wing : they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow , from which these were separated by a sunk fence , and where an array of mighty old thorn trees , strong , knotty , and broad as oaks , at once explained the etymology of the mansion 's designation .
farther off were hills : not so lofty as those round lowood , nor so craggy , nor so like barriers of separation from the living world ; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough , and seeming to embrace thornfield with a seclusion i had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of millcote .
a little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer thornfield : its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .
i was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air , yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks , yet surveying the wide , hoary front of the hall , and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like mrs. fairfax to inhabit , when that lady appeared at the door .
" what ! out already ? " said she . " i see you are an early riser . "
i went up to her , and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand .
" how do you like thornfield ? " she asked .
i told her i liked it very much .
" yes , " she said , " it is a pretty place ; but i fear it will be getting out of order , unless mr. rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently ; or , at least , visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor . "
" mr. rochester ! " i exclaimed . " who is he ? "
" the owner of thornfield , " she responded quietly . " did you not know he was called rochester ? "
of course i did not--i had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .
" i thought , " i continued , " thornfield belonged to you . "
" to me ? bless you , child ; what an idea !
to me ! i am only the housekeeper--the manager .
to be sure i am distantly related to the rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he was a clergyman , incumbent of hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and that church near the gates was his .
the present mr. rochester 's mother was a fairfax , and second cousin to my husband : but i never presume on the connection--in fact , it is nothing to me ; i consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper : my employer is always civil , and i expect nothing more . "
" and the little girl--my pupil ! "
" she is mr. rochester 's ward ; he commissioned me to find a governess for her .
he intended to have her brought up in ---shire , i believe .
here she comes , with her ' bonne , ' as she calls her nurse . "
the enigma then was explained : this affable and kind little widow was no great dame ; but a dependant like myself .
i did not like her the worse for that ; on the contrary , i felt better pleased than ever .
the equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension on her part : so much the better--my position was all the freer .
as i was meditating on this discovery , a little girl , followed by her attendant , came running up the lawn .
i looked at my pupil , who did not at first appear to notice me : she was quite a child , perhaps seven or eight years old , slightly built , with a pale , small-featured face , and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist .
" good morning , miss adela , " said mrs. fairfax .
" come and speak to the lady who is to teach you , and to make you a clever woman some day . "
she approached .
" c 'est la ma gouverante ! " said she , pointing to me , and addressing her nurse ; who answered-- " mais oui , certainement . "
" are they foreigners ? " i inquired , amazed at hearing the french language .
" the nurse is a foreigner , and adela was born on the continent ; and , i believe , never left it till within six months ago .
when she first came here she could speak no english ; now she can make shift to talk it a little : i don 't understand her , she mixes it so with french ; but you will make out her meaning very well , i dare say . "
fortunately i had had the advantage of being taught french by a french lady ; and as i had always made a point of conversing with madame pierrot as often as i could , and had besides , during the last seven years , learnt a portion of french by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my accent , and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher , i had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language , and was not likely to be much at a loss with mademoiselle adela .
she came and shook hand with me when she heard that i was her governess ; and as i led her in to breakfast , i addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue : she replied briefly at first , but after we were seated at the table , and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes , she suddenly commenced chattering fluently .
" ah ! " cried she , in french , " you speak my language as well as mr. rochester does : i can talk to you as i can to him , and so can sophie .
she will be glad : nobody here understands her : madame fairfax is all english .
sophie is my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked--how it did smoke ! --and i was sick , and so was sophie , and so was mr. rochester .
mr. rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon , and sophie and i had little beds in another place . i nearly fell out of mine ; it was like a shelf .
and mademoiselle--what is your name ? "
" eyre--jane eyre . "
" aire ?
bah !
i cannot say it .
well , our ship stopped in the morning , before it was quite daylight , at a great city--a huge city , with very dark houses and all smoky ; not at all like the pretty clean town i came from ; and mr. rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land , and sophie came after , and we all got into a coach , which took us to a beautiful large house , larger than this and finer , called an hotel .
we stayed there nearly a week : i and sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the park ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that i fed with crumbs . "
" can you understand her when she runs on so fast ? " asked mrs. fairfax .
i understood her very well , for i had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of madame pierrot .
" i wish , " continued the good lady , " you would ask her a question or two about her parents : i wonder if she remembers them ? "
" adele , " i inquired , " with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ? "
" i lived long ago with mama ; but she is gone to the holy virgin .
mama used to teach me to dance and sing , and to say verses . a great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama , and i used to dance before them , or to sit on their knees and sing to them : i liked it .
shall i let you hear me sing now ? "
she had finished her breakfast , so i permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments .
descending from her chair , she came and placed herself on my knee ; then , folding her little hands demurely before her , shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling , she commenced singing a song from some opera .
it was the strain of a forsaken lady , who , after bewailing the perfidy of her lover , calls pride to her aid ; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes , and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball , and prove to him , by the gaiety of her demeanour , how little his desertion has affected her .
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but i suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least i thought so .
this achieved , she jumped from my knee and said , " now , mademoiselle , i will repeat you some poetry . "
assuming an attitude , she began , " la ligue des rats : fable de la fontaine . "
she then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis , a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture , very unusual indeed at her age , and which proved she had been carefully trained .
" was it your mama who taught you that piece ? " i asked .
" yes , and she just used to say it in this way : ' qu ' avez vous donc ? lui dit un de ces rats ; parlez ! ' she made me lift my hand--so--to remind me to raise my voice at the question .
now shall i dance for you ? "
" no , that will do : but after your mama went to the holy virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ? "
" with madame frederic and her husband : she took care of me , but she is nothing related to me .
i think she is poor , for she had not so fine a house as mama .
i was not long there .
mr. rochester asked me if i would like to go and live with him in england , and i said yes ; for i knew mr. rochester before i knew madame frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to england , and now he is gone back again himself , and i never see him . "
after breakfast , adele and i withdrew to the library , which room , it appears , mr. rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom .
most of the books were locked up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works , and several volumes of light literature , poetry , biography , travels , a few romances , & c .
i suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal ; and , indeed , they contented me amply for the present ; compared with the scanty pickings i had now and then been able to glean at lowood , they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information .
in this room , too , there was a cabinet piano , quite new and of superior tone ; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes .
i found my pupil sufficiently docile , though disinclined to apply : she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind .
i felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first ; so , when i had talked to her a great deal , and got her to learn a little , and when the morning had advanced to noon , i allowed her to return to her nurse .
i then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use .
as i was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils , mrs. fairfax called to me : " your morning school-hours are over now , i suppose , " said she .
she was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open : i went in when she addressed me .
it was a large , stately apartment , with purple chairs and curtains , a turkey carpet , walnut-panelled walls , one vast window rich in slanted glass , and a lofty ceiling , nobly moulded .
mrs. fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar , which stood on a sideboard .
" what a beautiful room ! " i exclaimed , as i looked round ; for i had never before seen any half so imposing .
" yes ; this is the dining-room . i have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault . "
she pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window , and hung like it with a tyrian-dyed curtain , now looped up .
mounting to it by two broad steps , and looking through , i thought i caught a glimpse of a fairy place , so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond .
yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room , and within it a boudoir , both spread with white carpets , on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers ; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves , beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans ; while the ornaments on the pale parian mantelpiece were of sparkling bohemian glass , ruby red ; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire .
" in what order you keep these rooms , mrs. fairfax ! " said i .
" no dust , no canvas coverings : except that the air feels chilly , one would think they were inhabited daily . "
" why , miss eyre , though mr. rochester 's visits here are rare , they are always sudden and unexpected ; and as i observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up , and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival , i thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness . "
" is mr. rochester an exacting , fastidious sort of man ? "
" not particularly so ; but he has a gentleman 's tastes and habits , and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them . "
" do you like him ? is he generally liked ? "
" oh , yes ; the family have always been respected here .
almost all the land in this neighbourhood , as far as you can see , has belonged to the rochesters time out of mind . "
" well , but , leaving his land out of the question , do you like him ?
is he liked for himself ? "
" i have no cause to do otherwise than like him ; and i believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants : but he has never lived much amongst them . "
" but has he no peculiarities ?
what , in short , is his character ? "
" oh ! his character is unimpeachable , i suppose . he is rather peculiar , perhaps : he has travelled a great deal , and seen a great deal of the world , i should think . i dare say he is clever , but i never had much conversation with him . "
" in what way is he peculiar ? "
" i don 't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking , but you feel it when he speaks to you ; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest , whether he is pleased or the contrary ; you don 't thoroughly understand him , in short--at least , i don 't : but it is of no consequence , he is a very good master . "
this was all the account i got from mrs. fairfax of her employer and mine .
there are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character , or observing and describing salient points , either in persons or things : the good lady evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puzzled , but did not draw her out .
mr. rochester was mr. rochester in her eyes ; a gentleman , a landed proprietor--nothing more : she inquired and searched no further , and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity .
when we left the dining-room , she proposed to show me over the rest of the house ; and i followed her upstairs and downstairs , admiring as i went ; for all was well arranged and handsome .
the large front chambers i thought especially grand : and some of the third-storey rooms , though dark and low , were interesting from their air of antiquity .
the furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here , as fashions changed : and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old ; chests in oak or walnut , looking , with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs ' heads , like types of the hebrew ark ; rows of venerable chairs , high-backed and narrow ; stools still more antiquated , on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries , wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust .
all these relics gave to the third storey of thornfield hall the aspect of a home of the past : a shrine of memory .
i liked the hush , the gloom , the quaintness of these retreats in the day ; but i by no means coveted a night 's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds : shut in , some of them , with doors of oak ; shaded , others , with wrought old english hangings crusted with thick work , portraying effigies of strange flowers , and stranger birds , and strangest human beings , --all which would have looked strange , indeed , by the pallid gleam of moonlight .
" do the servants sleep in these rooms ? " i asked .
" no ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back ; no one ever sleeps here : one would almost say that , if there were a ghost at thornfield hall , this would be its haunt . "
" so i think : you have no ghost , then ? "
" none that i ever heard of , " returned mrs. fairfax , smiling .
" nor any traditions of one ? no legends or ghost stories ? "
" i believe not . and yet it is said the rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time : perhaps , though , that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now . "
" yes-- ' after life 's fitful fever they sleep well , ' " i muttered .
" where are you going now , mrs. fairfax ? " for she was moving away .
" on to the leads ; will you come and see the view from thence ? "
i followed still , up a very narrow staircase to the attics , and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall .
i was now on a level with the crow colony , and could see into their nests .
leaning over the battlements and looking far down , i surveyed the grounds laid out like a map : the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion ; the field , wide as a park , dotted with its ancient timber ; the wood , dun and sere , divided by a path visibly overgrown , greener with moss than the trees were with foliage ; the church at the gates , the road , the tranquil hills , all reposing in the autumn day 's sun ; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky , azure , marbled with pearly white .
no feature in the scene was extraordinary , but all was pleasing .
when i turned from it and repassed the trap-door , i could scarcely see my way down the ladder ; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which i had been looking up , and to that sunlit scene of grove , pasture , and green hill , of which the hall was the centre , and over which i had been gazing with delight .
mrs. fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door ; i , by drift of groping , found the outlet from the attic , and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase .
i lingered in the long passage to which this led , separating the front and back rooms of the third storey : narrow , low , and dim , with only one little window at the far end , and looking , with its two rows of small black doors all shut , like a corridor in some bluebeard 's castle .
while i paced softly on , the last sound i expected to hear in so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear . it was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .
i stopped : the sound ceased , only for an instant ; it began again , louder : for at first , though distinct , it was very low . it passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber ; though it originated but in one , and i could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued .
" mrs. fairfax ! " i called out : for i now heard her descending the great stairs . " did you hear that loud laugh ? who is it ? "
" some of the servants , very likely , " she answered : " perhaps grace poole . "
" did you hear it ? " i again inquired .
" yes , plainly : i often hear her : she sews in one of these rooms .
sometimes leah is with her ; they are frequently noisy together . "
the laugh was repeated in its low , syllabic tone , and terminated in an odd murmur .
" grace ! " exclaimed mrs. fairfax .
i really did not expect any grace to answer ; for the laugh was as tragic , as preternatural a laugh as any i ever heard ; and , but that it was high noon , and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation ; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear , i should have been superstitiously afraid .
however , the event showed me i was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise .
the door nearest me opened , and a servant came out , --a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set , square-made figure , red-haired , and with a hard , plain face : any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived .
" too much noise , grace , " said mrs. fairfax . " remember directions ! "
grace curtseyed silently and went in .
" she is a person we have to sew and assist leah in her housemaid 's work , " continued the widow ; " not altogether unobjectionable in some points , but she does well enough .
by-the-bye , how have you got on with your new pupil this morning ? "
the conversation , thus turned on adele , continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below .
adele came running to meet us in the hall , exclaiming--
" mesdames , vous etes servies ! " adding , " j 'ai bien faim , moi ! "
we found dinner ready , and waiting for us in mrs. fairfax 's room .
chapter xii
the promise of a smooth career , which my first calm introduction to thornfield hall seemed to pledge , was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates .
mrs. fairfax turned out to be what she appeared , a placid-tempered , kind-natured woman , of competent education and average intelligence .
my pupil was a lively child , who had been spoilt and indulged , and therefore was sometimes wayward ; but as she was committed entirely to my care , and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement , she soon forgot her little freaks , and became obedient and teachable .
she had no great talents , no marked traits of character , no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it .
she made reasonable progress , entertained for me a vivacious , though perhaps not very profound , affection ; and by her simplicity , gay prattle , and efforts to please , inspired me , in return , with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other 's society .
this , _ par parenthese _ , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children , and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion : but i am not writing to flatter parental egotism , to echo cant , or prop up humbug ; i am merely telling the truth .
i felt a conscientious solicitude for adele 's welfare and progress , and a quiet liking for her little self : just as i cherished towards mrs. fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness , and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me , and the moderation of her mind and character .
anybody may blame me who likes , when i add further , that , now and then , when i took a walk by myself in the grounds ; when i went down to the gates and looked through them along the road ; or when , while adele played with her nurse , and mrs. fairfax made jellies in the storeroom , i climbed the three staircases , raised the trap-door of the attic , and having reached the leads , looked out afar over sequestered field and hill , and along dim sky-line--that then i longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit ; which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life i had heard of but never seen--that then i desired more of practical experience than i possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind , of acquaintance with variety of character , than was here within my reach .
i valued what was good in mrs. fairfax , and what was good in adele ; but i believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness , and what i believed in i wished to behold .
who blames me ? many , no doubt ; and i shall be called discontented . i could not help it : the restlessness was in my nature ; it agitated me to pain sometimes .
then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey , backwards and forwards , safe in the silence and solitude of the spot , and allow my mind 's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it--and , certainly , they were many and glowing ; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement , which , while it swelled it in trouble , expanded it with life ; and , best of all , to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created , and narrated continuously ; quickened with all of incident , life , fire , feeling , that i desired and had not in my actual existence .
it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity : they must have action ; and they will make it if they cannot find it . millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine , and millions are in silent revolt against their lot .
nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth .
women are supposed to be very calm generally : but women feel just as men feel ; they need exercise for their faculties , and a field for their efforts , as much as their brothers do ; they suffer from too rigid a restraint , too absolute a stagnation , precisely as men would suffer ; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings , to playing on the piano and embroidering bags .
it is thoughtless to condemn them , or laugh at them , if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex .
when thus alone , i not unfrequently heard grace poole 's laugh : the same peal , the same low , slow ha ! ha ! which , when first heard , had thrilled me : i heard , too , her eccentric murmurs ; stranger than her laugh .
there were days when she was quite silent ; but there were others when i could not account for the sounds she made .
sometimes i saw her : she would come out of her room with a basin , or a plate , or a tray in her hand , go down to the kitchen and shortly return , generally ( oh , romantic reader , forgive me for telling the plain truth ! ) bearing a pot of porter .
her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities : hard-featured and staid , she had no point to which interest could attach .
i made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .
the other members of the household , viz . , john and his wife , leah the housemaid , and sophie the french nurse , were decent people ; but in no respect remarkable ; with sophie i used to talk french , and sometimes i asked her questions about her native country ; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn , and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry .
october , november , december passed away .
one afternoon in january , mrs. fairfax had begged a holiday for adele , because she had a cold ; and , as adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood , i accorded it , deeming that i did well in showing pliability on the point .
it was a fine , calm day , though very cold ; i was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning : mrs. fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted , so i put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to hay ; the distance , two miles , would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk .
having seen adele comfortably seated in her little chair by mrs. fairfax 's parlour fireside , and given her her best wax doll ( which i usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer ) to play with , and a story-book for change of amusement ; and having replied to her " revenez bientot , ma bonne amie , ma chere mdlle .
jeannette , " with a kiss i set out .
the ground was hard , the air was still , my road was lonely ; i walked fast till i got warm , and then i walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation .
it was three o 'clock ; the church bell tolled as i passed under the belfry : the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness , in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun .
i was a mile from thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .
if a breath of air stirred , it made no sound here ; for there was not a holly , not an evergreen to rustle , and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white , worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path .
far and wide , on each side , there were only fields , where no cattle now browsed ; and the little brown birds , which stirred occasionally in the hedge , looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop .
this lane inclined up-hill all the way to hay ; having reached the middle , i sat down on a stile which led thence into a field . gathering my mantle about me , and sheltering my hands in my muff , i did not feel the cold , though it froze keenly ; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway , where a little brooklet , now congealed , had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since .
from my seat i could look down on thornfield : the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me ; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west .
i lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees , and sank crimson and clear behind them . i then turned eastward .
on the hill-top above me sat the rising moon ; pale yet as a cloud , but brightening momentarily , she looked over hay , which , half lost in trees , sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys : it was yet a mile distant , but in the absolute hush i could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life .
my ear , too , felt the flow of currents ; in what dales and depths i could not tell : but there were many hills beyond hay , and doubtless many becks threading their passes .
that evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams , the sough of the most remote .
a rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings , at once so far away and so clear : a positive tramp , tramp , a metallic clatter , which effaced the soft wave-wanderings ; as , in a picture , the solid mass of a crag , or the rough boles of a great oak , drawn in dark and strong on the foreground , efface the aerial distance of azure hill , sunny horizon , and blended clouds where tint melts into tint .
the din was on the causeway : a horse was coming ; the windings of the lane yet hid it , but it approached .
i was just leaving the stile ; yet , as the path was narrow , i sat still to let it go by .
in those days i was young , and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind : the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish ; and when they recurred , maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give .
as this horse approached , and as i watched for it to appear through the dusk , i remembered certain of bessie 's tales , wherein figured a north-of-england spirit called a " gytrash , " which , in the form of horse , mule , or large dog , haunted solitary ways , and sometimes came upon belated travellers , as this horse was now coming upon me .
it was very near , but not yet in sight ; when , in addition to the tramp , tramp , i heard a rush under the hedge , and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog , whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees .
it was exactly one form of bessie 's gytrash--a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head : it passed me , however , quietly enough ; not staying to look up , with strange pretercanine eyes , in my face , as i half expected it would .
the horse followed , --a tall steed , and on its back a rider .
the man , the human being , broke the spell at once . nothing ever rode the gytrash : it was always alone ; and goblins , to my notions , though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts , could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form .
no gytrash was this , --only a traveller taking the short cut to millcote .
he passed , and i went on ; a few steps , and i turned : a sliding sound and an exclamation of " what the deuce is to do now ? " and a clattering tumble , arrested my attention .
man and horse were down ; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway .
the dog came bounding back , and seeing his master in a predicament , and hearing the horse groan , barked till the evening hills echoed the sound , which was deep in proportion to his magnitude .
he snuffed round the prostrate group , and then he ran up to me ; it was all he could do , --there was no other help at hand to summon .
i obeyed him , and walked down to the traveller , by this time struggling himself free of his steed .
his efforts were so vigorous , i thought he could not be much hurt ; but i asked him the question--
" are you injured , sir ? "
i think he was swearing , but am not certain ; however , he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly .
" can i do anything ? " i asked again .
" you must just stand on one side , " he answered as he rose , first to his knees , and then to his feet .
i did ; whereupon began a heaving , stamping , clattering process , accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards ' distance ; but i would not be driven quite away till i saw the event .
this was finally fortunate ; the horse was re-established , and the dog was silenced with a " down , pilot ! "
the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down .
i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .
" if you are hurt , and want help , sir , i can fetch some one either from thornfield hall or from hay . "
" thank you : i shall do : i have no broken bones , --only a sprain ; " and again he stood up and tried his foot , but the result extorted an involuntary " ugh ! "
something of daylight still lingered , and the moon was waxing bright : i could see him plainly .
his figure was enveloped in a riding cloak , fur collared and steel clasped ; its details were not apparent , but i traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest .
he had a dark face , with stern features and a heavy brow ; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now ; he was past youth , but had not reached middle-age ; perhaps he might be thirty-five .
i felt no fear of him , and but little shyness .
had he been a handsome , heroic- looking young gentleman , i should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will , and offering my services unasked .
i had hardly ever seen a handsome youth ; never in my life spoken to one .
i had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty , elegance , gallantry , fascination ; but had i met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape , i should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me , and should have shunned them as one would fire , lightning , or anything else that is bright but antipathetic .
if even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when i addressed him ; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks , i should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries : but the frown , the roughness of the traveller , set me at my ease : i retained my station when he waved to me to go , and announced--
" i cannot think of leaving you , sir , at so late an hour , in this solitary lane , till i see you are fit to mount your horse . "
he looked at me when i said this ; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before .
" i should think you ought to be at home yourself , " said he , " if you have a home in this neighbourhood : where do you come from ? "
" from just below ; and i am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight : i will run over to hay for you with pleasure , if you wish it : indeed , i am going there to post a letter . "
" you live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements ? " pointing to thornfield hall , on which the moon cast a hoary gleam , bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that , by contrast with the western sky , now seemed one mass of shadow .
" yes , sir . "
" whose house is it ? "
" mr. rochester 's . "
" do you know mr. rochester ? "
" no , i have never seen him . "
" he is not resident , then ? "
" no . "
" can you tell me where he is ? "
" i cannot . "
" you are not a servant at the hall , of course .
you are-- " he stopped , ran his eye over my dress , which , as usual , was quite simple : a black merino cloak , a black beaver bonnet ; neither of them half fine enough for a lady 's-maid . he seemed puzzled to decide what i was ; i helped him .
" i am the governess . "
" ah , the governess ! " he repeated ; " deuce take me , if i had not forgotten !
the governess ! " and again my raiment underwent scrutiny .
in two minutes he rose from the stile : his face expressed pain when he tried to move .
" i cannot commission you to fetch help , " he said ; " but you may help me a little yourself , if you will be so kind . "
" yes , sir . "
" you have not an umbrella that i can use as a stick ? "
" no . "
" try to get hold of my horse 's bridle and lead him to me : you are not afraid ? "
i should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone , but when told to do it , i was disposed to obey .
i put down my muff on the stile , and went up to the tall steed ; i endeavoured to catch the bridle , but it was a spirited thing , and would not let me come near its head ; i made effort on effort , though in vain : meantime , i was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet .
the traveller waited and watched for some time , and at last he laughed .
" i see , " he said , " the mountain will never be brought to mahomet , so all you can do is to aid mahomet to go to the mountain ; i must beg of you to come here . "
i came .
" excuse me , " he continued : " necessity compels me to make you useful . "
he laid a heavy hand on my shoulder , and leaning on me with some stress , limped to his horse . having once caught the bridle , he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle ; grimacing grimly as he made the effort , for it wrenched his sprain .
" now , " said he , releasing his under lip from a hard bite , " just hand me my whip ; it lies there under the hedge . "
i sought it and found it .
" thank you ; now make haste with the letter to hay , and return as fast as you can . "
a touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear , and then bound away ; the dog rushed in his traces ; all three vanished , " like heath that , in the wilderness , the wild wind whirls away . "
i took up my muff and walked on .
the incident had occurred and was gone for me : it _ was _ an incident of no moment , no romance , no interest in a sense ; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life .
my help had been needed and claimed ; i had given it : i was pleased to have done something ; trivial , transitory though the deed was , it was yet an active thing , and i was weary of an existence all passive .
the new face , too , was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory ; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there : firstly , because it was masculine ; and , secondly , because it was dark , strong , and stern .
i had it still before me when i entered hay , and slipped the letter into the post-office ; i saw it as i walked fast down-hill all the way home .
when i came to the stile , i stopped a minute , looked round and listened , with an idea that a horse 's hoofs might ring on the causeway again , and that a rider in a cloak , and a gytrash-like newfoundland dog , might be again apparent : i saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me , rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams ; i heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round thornfield , a mile distant ; and when i glanced down in the direction of the murmur , my eye , traversing the hall-front , caught a light kindling in a window : it reminded me that i was late , and i hurried on .
i did not like re-entering thornfield .
to pass its threshold was to return to stagnation ; to cross the silent hall , to ascend the darksome staircase , to seek my own lonely little room , and then to meet tranquil mrs. fairfax , and spend the long winter evening with her , and her only , was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk , --to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence ; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease i was becoming incapable of appreciating .
what good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life , and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which i now repined !
yes , just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a " too easy chair " to take a long walk : and just as natural was the wish to stir , under my circumstances , as it would be under his .
i lingered at the gates ; i lingered on the lawn ; i paced backwards and forwards on the pavement ; the shutters of the glass door were closed ; i could not see into the interior ; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells , as it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me , --a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud ; the moon ascending it in solemn march ; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops , from behind which she had come , far and farther below her , and aspired to the zenith , midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance ; and for those trembling stars that followed her course ; they made my heart tremble , my veins glow when i viewed them .
little things recall us to earth ; the clock struck in the hall ; that sufficed ; i turned from moon and stars , opened a side- door , and went in .
the hall was not dark , nor yet was it lit , only by the high-hung bronze lamp ; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase .
this ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room , whose two- leaved door stood open , and showed a genial fire in the grate , glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons , and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture , in the most pleasant radiance .
it revealed , too , a group near the mantelpiece : i had scarcely caught it , and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices , amongst which i seemed to distinguish the tones of adele , when the door closed .
i hastened to mrs. fairfax 's room ; there was a fire there too , but no candle , and no mrs. fairfax .
instead , all alone , sitting upright on the rug , and gazing with gravity at the blaze , i beheld a great black and white long-haired dog , just like the gytrash of the lane .
it was so like it that i went forward and said-- " pilot " and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me .
i caressed him , and he wagged his great tail ; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with , and i could not tell whence he had come . i rang the bell , for i wanted a candle ; and i wanted , too , to get an account of this visitant .
leah entered .
" what dog is this ? "
" he came with master . "
" with whom ? "
" with master--mr . rochester--he is just arrived . "
" indeed ! and is mrs. fairfax with him ? "
" yes , and miss adele ; they are in the dining-room , and john is gone for a surgeon ; for master has had an accident ; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained . "
" did the horse fall in hay lane ? "
" yes , coming down-hill ; it slipped on some ice . "
" ah !
bring me a candle will you leah ? "
leah brought it ; she entered , followed by mrs. fairfax , who repeated the news ; adding that mr. carter the surgeon was come , and was now with mr. rochester : then she hurried out to give orders about tea , and i went upstairs to take off my things .
chapter xiii
mr. rochester , it seems , by the surgeon 's orders , went to bed early that night ; nor did he rise soon next morning .
when he did come down , it was to attend to business : his agent and some of his tenants were arrived , and waiting to speak with him .
adele and i had now to vacate the library : it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers .
a fire was lit in an apartment upstairs , and there i carried our books , and arranged it for the future schoolroom .
i discerned in the course of the morning that thornfield hall was a changed place : no longer silent as a church , it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door , or a clang of the bell ; steps , too , often traversed the hall , and new voices spoke in different keys below ; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it ; it had a master : for my part , i liked it better .
adele was not easy to teach that day ; she could not apply : she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of mr. rochester ; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs , in order , as i shrewdly suspected , to visit the library , where i knew she was not wanted ; then , when i got a little angry , and made her sit still , she continued to talk incessantly of her " ami , monsieur edouard fairfax _ de _ rochester , " as she dubbed him ( i had not before heard his prenomens ) , and to conjecture what presents he had brought her : for it appears he had intimated the night before , that when his luggage came from millcote , there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest .
" et cela doit signifier , " said she , " qu 'il y aura la dedans un cadeau pour moi , et peut-etre pour vous aussi , mademoiselle .
monsieur a parle de vous : il m 'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante , et si elle n 'etait pas une petite personne , assez mince et un peu pale .
j 'ai dit qu 'oui : car c 'est vrai , n 'est-ce pas , mademoiselle ? "
i and my pupil dined as usual in mrs. fairfax 's parlour ; the afternoon was wild and snowy , and we passed it in the schoolroom .
at dark i allowed adele to put away books and work , and to run downstairs ; for , from the comparative silence below , and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell , i conjectured that mr. rochester was now at liberty .
left alone , i walked to the window ; but nothing was to be seen thence : twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air , and hid the very shrubs on the lawn .
i let down the curtain and went back to the fireside .
in the clear embers i was tracing a view , not unlike a picture i remembered to have seen of the castle of heidelberg , on the rhine , when mrs. fairfax came in , breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic i had been piercing together , and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude .
" mr. rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening , " said she : " he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before . "
" when is his tea-time ? " i inquired .
" oh , at six o 'clock : he keeps early hours in the country .
you had better change your frock now ; i will go with you and fasten it .
here is a candle . "
" is it necessary to change my frock ? "
" yes , you had better : i always dress for the evening when mr. rochester is here . "
this additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately ; however , i repaired to my room , and , with mrs. fairfax 's aid , replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk ; the best and the only additional one i had , except one of light grey , which , in my lowood notions of the toilette , i thought too fine to be worn , except on first-rate occasions .
" you want a brooch , " said mrs. fairfax .
i had a single little pearl ornament which miss temple gave me as a parting keepsake : i put it on , and then we went downstairs .
unused as i was to strangers , it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in mr. rochester 's presence .
i let mrs. fairfax precede me into the dining-room , and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and , passing the arch , whose curtain was now dropped , entered the elegant recess beyond .
two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay pilot--adele knelt near him .
half reclined on a couch appeared mr. rochester , his foot supported by the cushion ; he was looking at adele and the dog : the fire shone full on his face .
i knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows ; his square forehead , made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair .
i recognised his decisive nose , more remarkable for character than beauty ; his full nostrils , denoting , i thought , choler ; his grim mouth , chin , and jaw--yes , all three were very grim , and no mistake .
his shape , now divested of cloak , i perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy : i suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked , though neither tall nor graceful .
mr. rochester must have been aware of the entrance of mrs. fairfax and myself ; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us , for he never lifted his head as we approached .
" here is miss eyre , sir , " said mrs. fairfax , in her quiet way .
he bowed , still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child .
" let miss eyre be seated , " said he : and there was something in the forced stiff bow , in the impatient yet formal tone , which seemed further to express , " what the deuce is it to me whether miss eyre be there or not ? at this moment i am not disposed to accost her . "
i sat down quite disembarrassed .
a reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me : i could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part ; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation ; on the contrary , a decent quiescence , under the freak of manner , gave me the advantage .
besides , the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant : i felt interested to see how he would go on .
he went on as a statue would , that is , he neither spoke nor moved .
mrs. fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable , and she began to talk . kindly , as usual--and , as usual , rather trite--she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day ; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain : then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it .
" madam , i should like some tea , " was the sole rejoinder she got .
she hastened to ring the bell ; and when the tray came , she proceeded to arrange the cups , spoons , & c . , with assiduous celerity .
i and adele went to the table ; but the master did not leave his couch .
" will you hand mr. rochester 's cup ? " said mrs. fairfax to me ; " adele might perhaps spill it . "
i did as requested .
as he took the cup from my hand , adele , thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour , cried out--
" n 'est-ce pas , monsieur , qu 'il y a un cadeau pour mademoiselle eyre dans votre petit coffre ? "
" who talks of cadeaux ? " said he gruffly . " did you expect a present , miss eyre ?
are you fond of presents ? " and he searched my face with eyes that i saw were dark , irate , and piercing .
" i hardly know , sir ; i have little experience of them : they are generally thought pleasant things . "
" generally thought ? but what do _ you _ think ? "
" i should be obliged to take time , sir , before i could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance : a present has many faces to it , has it not ? and one should consider all , before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature . "
" miss eyre , you are not so unsophisticated as adele : she demands a ' cadeau , ' clamorously , the moment she sees me : you beat about the bush . "
" because i have less confidence in my deserts than adele has : she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance , and the right too of custom ; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings ; but if i had to make out a case i should be puzzled , since i am a stranger , and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment . "
" oh , don 't fall back on over-modesty ! i have examined adele , and find you have taken great pains with her : she is not bright , she has no talents ; yet in a short time she has made much improvement . "
" sir , you have now given me my ' cadeau ; ' i am obliged to you : it is the meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils ' progress . "
" humph ! " said mr. rochester , and he took his tea in silence .
" come to the fire , " said the master , when the tray was taken away , and mrs. fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting ; while adele was leading me by the hand round the room , showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres .
we obeyed , as in duty bound ; adele wanted to take a seat on my knee , but she was ordered to amuse herself with pilot .
" you have been resident in my house three months ? "
" yes , sir . "
" and you came from-- ? " " from lowood school , in ---shire . "
" ah ! a charitable concern .
how long were you there ? "
" eight years . "
" eight years ! you must be tenacious of life . i thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution !
no wonder you have rather the look of another world . i marvelled where you had got that sort of face .
when you came on me in hay lane last night , i thought unaccountably of fairy tales , and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse : i am not sure yet .
who are your parents ? "
" i have none . " " nor ever had , i suppose : do you remember them ? "
" no . "
" i thought not .
and so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile ? "
" for whom , sir ? "
" for the men in green : it was a proper moonlight evening for them .
did i break through one of your rings , that you spread that damned ice on the causeway ? "
i shook my head .
" the men in green all forsook england a hundred years ago , " said i , speaking as seriously as he had done .
" and not even in hay lane , or the fields about it , could you find a trace of them .
i don 't think either summer or harvest , or winter moon , will ever shine on their revels more . "
mrs. fairfax had dropped her knitting , and , with raised eyebrows , seemed wondering what sort of talk this was .
" well , " resumed mr. rochester , " if you disown parents , you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ? "
" no ; none that i ever saw . " " and your home ? " " i have none . "
" where do your brothers and sisters live ? " " i have no brothers or sisters . "
" who recommended you to come here ? "
" i advertised , and mrs. fairfax answered my advertisement . "
" yes , " said the good lady , who now knew what ground we were upon , " and i am daily thankful for the choice providence led me to make .
miss eyre has been an invaluable companion to me , and a kind and careful teacher to adele . "
" don 't trouble yourself to give her a character , " returned mr. rochester : " eulogiums will not bias me ; i shall judge for myself .
she began by felling my horse . "
" sir ? " said mrs. fairfax .
" i have to thank her for this sprain . "
the widow looked bewildered .
" miss eyre , have you ever lived in a town ? "
" no , sir . "
" have you seen much society ? " " none but the pupils and teachers of lowood , and now the inmates of thornfield . "
" have you read much ? " " only such books as came in my way ; and they have not been numerous or very learned . "
" you have lived the life of a nun : no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms ; --brocklehurst , who i understand directs lowood , is a parson , is he not ? "
" yes , sir . "
" and you girls probably worshipped him , as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director . "
" oh , no . "
" you are very cool ! no !
what ! a novice not worship her priest !
that sounds blasphemous . "
" i disliked mr. brocklehurst ; and i was not alone in the feeling .
he is a harsh man ; at once pompous and meddling ; he cut off our hair ; and for economy 's sake bought us bad needles and thread , with which we could hardly sew . "
" that was very false economy , " remarked mrs. fairfax , who now again caught the drift of the dialogue .
" and was that the head and front of his offending ? " demanded mr. rochester .
" he starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department , before the committee was appointed ; and he bored us with long lectures once a week , and with evening readings from books of his own inditing , about sudden deaths and judgments , which made us afraid to go to bed . "
" what age were you when you went to lowood ? "
" about ten . " " and you stayed there eight years : you are now , then , eighteen ? "
i assented .
" arithmetic , you see , is useful ; without its aid , i should hardly have been able to guess your age .
it is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case .
and now what did you learn at lowood ? can you play ? "
" a little . "
" of course : that is the established answer .
go into the library--i mean , if you please.-- ( excuse my tone of command ; i am used to say , ' do this , ' and it is done : i cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate . ) --go , then , into the library ; take a candle with you ; leave the door open ; sit down to the piano , and play a tune . "
i departed , obeying his directions .
" enough ! " he called out in a few minutes . " you play _ a little _ , i see ; like any other english school-girl ; perhaps rather better than some , but not well . "
i closed the piano and returned .
mr. rochester continued-- " adele showed me some sketches this morning , which she said were yours . i don 't know whether they were entirely of your doing ; probably a master aided you ? "
" no , indeed ! " i interjected .
" ah ! that pricks pride . well , fetch me your portfolio , if you can vouch for its contents being original ; but don 't pass your word unless you are certain : i can recognise patchwork . "
" then i will say nothing , and you shall judge for yourself , sir . "
i brought the portfolio from the library .
" approach the table , " said he ; and i wheeled it to his couch .
adele and mrs. fairfax drew near to see the pictures .
" no crowding , " said mr. rochester : " take the drawings from my hand as i finish with them ; but don 't push your faces up to mine . "
he deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting . three he laid aside ; the others , when he had examined them , he swept from him .
" take them off to the other table , mrs. fairfax , " said he , " and look at them with adele ; --you " ( glancing at me ) " resume your seat , and answer my questions .
i perceive those pictures were done by one hand : was that hand yours ? "
" yes . "
" and when did you find time to do them ? they have taken much time , and some thought . "
" i did them in the last two vacations i spent at lowood , when i had no other occupation . "
" where did you get your copies ? " " out of my head . "
" that head i see now on your shoulders ? "
" yes , sir . "
" has it other furniture of the same kind within ? "
" i should think it may have : i should hope--better . "
he spread the pictures before him , and again surveyed them alternately .
while he is so occupied , i will tell you , reader , what they are : and first , i must premise that they are nothing wonderful .
the subjects had , indeed , risen vividly on my mind .
as i saw them with the spiritual eye , before i attempted to embody them , they were striking ; but my hand would not second my fancy , and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing i had conceived .
these pictures were in water-colours .
the first represented clouds low and livid , rolling over a swollen sea : all the distance was in eclipse ; so , too , was the foreground ; or rather , the nearest billows , for there was no land .
