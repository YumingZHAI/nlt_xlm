are you the little scamp my daughter went crazy over ?
anyway , he 's a good boy .
and very polite if you can believe it .
we 'll see .
he 's one of the best blacksmiths in the country .
okay , grandpa .
ah .
there you are .
- this one ?
- yes , it will stir the fire .
in 2 months , you 'll have man 's muscles !
you can stop now , olivier .
you should tour the stable and say hi to the cows .
you 'll find 3 . they 're kind .
there 's dourade , the most assured .
then , la marcade , and finally , poumerade , the one with the spots . - where is the stable ?
- in the back .
you can go .
hello cows !
how are you ?
and you , la marcade . and you are la dourade .
how are you , poumerade ?
let me introduce myself .
normally i live in montmartre .
what are you doing here ?
get out of here , you hear me ?
he knows what to expect , now . if that bandit ever comes near the farm again .
what is the sense of adding misery to misery ?
come on , now . he provoked me , right ? i didn 't start anything .
- we must understand him . - understand him !
if you can understand a criminal , you can understand me as well .
if he ever comes close to the lad he knows what to expect .
i thought your god was the god of forgiveness .
leave my god alone ! i 'm taking the animals to the fields .
make sure the boy doesn 't leave the farm unaccompanied .
why not ? he 's not in prison , here .
you read what victoria wrote in her letter :
you must never leave that little scoundrel out of your sight !
you 'd think victoria makes the rules in my home !
could you please call " pitchou " ?
olivier ! go see your grandfather .
right , read me that article .
" the nazi party stated that the germans have rallied in great numbers ...
" by adolf hitler to burn all books deemed subversive ...
" and decadent in the public square .
" several million books were reduced to ashes on the morning of may 5 . "
you see , olivier , when the world 's train leaves its tracks , no one knows where it will stop .
why would anyone want to burn books ?
they bring no harm . they don 't want people to think ! they 're being groomed to be like machines .
but tell me , you read very well , how can you be doing so poorly in class , at least according to your aunt victoria ?
- i don 't know , grandpa . - you don 't know ...
furthermore , it seems you sneak out of the college at night . you 're a real escoulas !
in our family we always had rebels .
look at me : i 'm the only red in this country of whites !
say , grandpa ?
yes ?
the sanatorium where marceau is staying , it 's in this region , right ?
i say , you go straight to the point .
you 've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanatorium .
tell me , did you come here to see marceau ?
- yes , grandpa . - it 's good to tell the truth . but ...
victoria was very clear that under no circumstance ... you were to go to the sanatorium .
but why would she object ?
she must have her reasons . you see , we 're alike .
you think so ?
and why is that ?
because i want to see marceau too ! i really miss my grandson .
he grew up here .
always running after girls in the hills , and fishing for trout or crayfish .
we had some great times , him and me .
but now , it only hurts to know he 's there .
the doctor told me i couldn 't go , that i could catch his illness .
but mark my words :
we 're going to see him together ! - really ? - as real as i am an escoulas .
i looked at the map , it 's about 50 km .
we 're not going to take the road .
the mountain trails will save us at least 10 km .
we 'll take a horse and buggy , and i 'll tell them i 'm taking you to the animal fair in langeac .
will they let us go ?
they 'll say i 'm crazy . but i 'm head of this family . - i can do what i want , right ?
- yes , grandpa ! hold on .
don 't get your spirits too high .
i need to know if you can keep a secret .
with victor and grannie , you have to act a bit , show them you 're not really thrilled about coming with me .
- right . - good .
we shouldn 't arouse their suspicions .
we 'll leave sunday at dawn .
but until then ...
that means we won 't arrive before nightfall . they 'll figure out we didn 't go to langeac .
so what ?
once i 've seen marceau , they can think what they want .
i don 't care .
at least we 're lucky , the weather 's on our side .
hopefully we won 't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass .
let 's go , nono . let 's go !
that 's it , grandpa !
- i gave him some oats . - that 's good .
- here .
let 's have a little feast !
some ham , bread and wine .
that 's my holy trinity .
you see , whatever victoria might think ,
i wouldn 't trade a single tree from these mountains ... for all the lights in paris .
say , grandpa ? why doesn 't grannie like being kissed ? you must understand her .
she lost 2 children .
that made her a little colder .
if you had known her when she was in her 20s , she was beautiful . a real eye-popper .
you know , for our marriage , we undertook the white stick ceremony .
the white stick ceremony ?
what 's that ? if the fiancee placed a broom on its flip-side against her door , it meant she didn 't want you .
- that is so funny .
- you think so ? damn it ! i didn 't sleep all night .
but the next morning , grannie had turned all the brooms on the farm on the right side .
and even the filthy ones .
if only she could hear me !
at the time , she just loved clinging to my arm as we danced .
what are you wishing for , young mountaineer ? what did you hope to acquire if you are unwilling to dance ?
que volio cerca , jovo de la montagna ?
que volio cerca , si volio pas danser ? if you didn 't want to dance , you should not have come .
aie ! grandpa !
- i tripped , olivier .
- come , come . come , it 's nothing .
it 's nothing .
just give me a hand .
serves me right for playing the young man .
there .
i 'm breathing better and i 'll be alright .
we still have ... 2 km uphill .
the road will be easier after that .
and what if it 's m 'sieur privat ?
we 'll say hi anyway .
- but he tried to kill my parents !
- so what ? you don 't fire a gun at people without a reason .
have you ever asked yourself why he did that ?
grandpa ! it 's uncle victor .
that 's a different matter .
- you think i don 't see through this ?
you 'll never get to the sanatorium before nightfall .
it 's madness . what do you mean ?
is it madness to want to see my grandson ?
- you 're the one that 's crazy !
- i might be crazy ... but you 're turning around and i come with you .
and you , olivier , don 't try that again or i 'll bust your ass .
and not a word to your grandma , she 'll gouge your eyes out .
i bought a 6 lb ham at fayet 's .
let 's go .
you see , the word solitude , it only takes one " l " .
because it 's all alone , you see !
you didn 't conjugate correctly the past tense of the verb " shoot . "
tell me why ! because it 's an exception . it 's an irregular verb .
then why couldn 't you get that right ? i forgot .
on top of that you misspelled the proper name of the bandit .
if you work hard , you 'll soon become an ace .
but ... when you go back to school , you 'll have to go back to paris .
- but , grandpa ... - it 's sad to say , but nowadays , the future of youth lies within the cities .
it breaks my heart to say it because , as you know , i would love it if you could stay here with me .
i would love to stay here with you too . don 't be silly !
after a few months , you 'd get bored .
no . i 'm happy , here .
i 'm happy like ... - like ...
- like with your mother ?
so much the better .
you should join your grannie out in the fields .
today , she 's at devil 's abyss .
you know where that is ?
what will grannie say ? you 'll soon find out .
don 't forget to greet the folks you encounter .
here people talk to each other .
" parlez-moi d 'amour
" redites-moi des choses tendres
" votre beau discours ... " mon coeur n 'est pas las de l 'entendre
besides , you wanted to kill my parents !
you said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you !
but you fired a gun at them .
that 's why you went to jail !
it 's your aunt who told you that ?
let me tell you what happened .
i don 't want to hear it .
leave me alone !
what are you up to , olivier ?
you came directly ?
no , i swear it , grannie .
- did you meet anyone on the way ? - no .
actually , yes . i saw louison flandin .
he asked me to go to a soccer game with him .
- i told him i was coming to see you .
- very well , then .
good . well , i 'm off to see the cows .
what are you doing ?
you can tell you 're from paris !
cows don 't care for sugar . they like salt !
give the sugar to the dog .
it 's not good for his eyes , but over here , we don 't let anything go to waste .
here , doggy , come boy .
good , huh ? that 's good .
how can you tell when it 's time to go back to the farm , then ?
look at the shadow cast by the shed .
when it reaches the boulder , it 's time to bring the cows home .
looks like you have a heat stroke . go freshen up at the river .
- the river looks pretty deep .
- " devil 's abyss " ?
- a long time ago , there was a man who bragged about not believing in either god or devil .
well , the poor bastard got his punishment .
the river swallowed him .
- really ? - obviously ! he made a point to come and work here on the lord 's day .
one stormy day , as he was driving his cart along the banks , he surely came too close to the precipice .
then the two hands of the devil lunged from the river , his long claws grasped him fiercely so he couldn 't move , and down he went to the bottom with his two horses !
- that 's not true . it 's a legend . - you 're like your grandfather .
climb up on the rock ... and bend over the precipice .
you 'll see the remains of the cart at the bottom !
- see it ?
- not sure .
the water isn 't clear .
look again !
ah yes ! i see it .
i see the cart with bones and a skeleton !
did you notice , grannie ?
the shadow has set on the boulder .
well done , you 're a fast learner .
soon , you 'll be able to lead the cows to the pasture all by yourself .
if you like . here .
take my stick and lead them toward the trail .
go on ! we 'll see how well you do .
come on cows ! let 's go .
where are you going , poumerade ?
it 's pretty obvious you pealed chunks off her hoof .
i 'm not selling her to you . ( speaking patois )
patois with a parisian accent . very comical .
he 's making progress in this area too !
- olivier ! it 's great that you can now smith , but you can 't neglect your studies .
wait !
we 're not done yet .
an automobile !
she did well for herself , our victoria .
that 's for sure .
she went to paris and paris went to her head .
she 's ashamed of us .
she avoids telling her friends that we are blacksmiths . instead , she says we 're ironwork artists .
i think being a blacksmith is a more noble trade .
you plan to stay with us ?
no , no . i came in like the wind , just to drop off julienne .
i thought you dropped in to say hi .
that too , of course .
my god ; this heat ! tell me ,
marceau , my grandson .
how 's he doing ?
his condition is stable the doctors tell me .
but they may have to perform a thoraco .
- a thoracoplasty .
it 's an operation consisting of compressing the diseased lung by removing some ribs .
- in his case , 6 .
- that 's terrible !
- are you going back ? - no .
he 's asked us to leave .
one-eyed bitch !
i would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health .
children should not have to suffer . and how is your leg doing ?
a bit of pain , that 's all .
the real burden is inaction . lucky for me , i have olivier .
- he seems well acclimatised . - yes .
he 's very happy , here .
but you must take him back to paris .
oh no .
that 's out of the question !
victoria !
i am your father . this is my home . i 'm in charge .
and you 'll listen to me , for god 's sake !
i worked with him almost every day .
he 's a very bright boy .
he 's inquisitive , devours books .
with a bit of help , he 'll become someone .
he must be allowed to further his studies .
you have no right to condemn him to ignorance .
sometimes i wonder if perhaps i wasn 't too hard on him .
well , speak of the devil . - good day , aunt .
- i am happy to see you again .
- likewise , aunt .
your grandfather tells me you like it here .
yes , aunt .
you know what would make him happy ?
- going up to see marceau .
- that won 't happen .
it 's true ! show her the letter .
your aunt was clear : he doesn 't want to see anyone .
he 's was cruel toward me , this morning .
- i 'm sure he 'll want to see me .
- listen ,
victoria , it would do marceau a lot of good !
well .
if you 're ready in 5 minutes , i 'll drop you off at the sanatorium .
there is an evening coach .
- thank you , aunt . - remember : 5 minutes ! - i 'll be ready .
- hey !
olivier , before you go , drink a bit of wine and chew on some garlic .
it will give you strength .
and repel evil .
guillaume , please ! stop the car at the next curve .
marceau is lost , olivier .
the doctors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope .
you must not tell anyone . do you understand ?
- i swear , aunt . ah !
my god .
it 's not fair !
he suffers immensely .
you 'll see , he 's changed .
but he mustn 't find out .
anyway , who knows .
perhaps there is still a chance .
i 'm sure of it , my aunt .
i 'm sure of it .
i don 't have the courage .
he 's inside that building .
room 18 . second floor .
you 'll have to sneak in , children are not allowed .
don 't worry .
thank you , aunt .
i know you . you 're his cousin .
you can 't stay here . he 's not in his room .
he 's outside , in the solarium .
- go on !
- thanks .
- it 's you , my little outcast .
i knew you would come .
- how did you get here ? - your mother brought me .
you see , the divine isn 't that bad .
have a seat .
by the way , bravo for the stunt you pulled at the college .
your letter cracked me up . a work of art !
how are you feeling ?
i hope you didn 't come for a medical report .
it boils down to one word : irrecoverable .
that 's not true .
after your operation , things will improve .
that 's right ...
hope that everything will go well after losing half your ribs !
i must admit , i 'm a little pessimistic .
you see , olivier .
i would have preferred dying in new york .
or on the bridge of a transatlantic .
much better than here , don 't you think ?
olivier , i beg you .
you remember ... ?
the concert by louis armstrong ?
we share so many memories you and i .
we do indeed !
grandpa embraces you warmly .
tell him i 'm doing well .
how is he ?
his leg still hurts .
you know , we almost succeeded to come see you .
- we were forced to turn back , though .
- darn escoulas , hasn 't changed a bit .
well , here comes my guardian angel .
as you can see , i have nothing to complain about .
i was rude with julienne this morning .
i would like you to watch over her . extend her the love i was incapable of giving her .
okay ? - do you promise ?
- i promise , marceau .
alright , time to go .
and please ...
- don 't come back to see me .
- why ? - please .
- you can 't stay , olivier .
i told you already .
children are not allowed .
don 't be angry with him .
you 'll see , you 'll like it up here .
this is the best mattress ever .
so put your mind at rest .
have you seen these old books ?
" le tour de la france by two children . "
- of course it 's good . with that i learned to read to my wife .
- may i open it ?
look at this beautiful medal .
it was your father 's . with palms .
and what 's this ?
belongs to my daughter .
- aunt victoria ?
- yes .
long ago , with only an orange , you could celebrate christmas eve .
oh yes ! back then , we didn 't have the luxury of going ... to the hospital in a carriage .
life was really harsh ... and money was hard to come by . we would fight over it .
have you seen this funny boot ?
all bloated and with an enormous sole .
that shoe belonged to your dad .
you see , we send boys to their death before they can experience life .
your poor father .
when he came back to this country , after he was injured ,
i didn 't recognize him . all i could say was : " there you are . "
he wept .
he walked between two crutches , still bore shrapnel in his skin ,
his lungs burnt by the gas .
to think he was once as swift as a squirrel , only to stagger into a cloud .
he would raise his eyes , as if to prepare an answer , but he said nothing .
your mother restored his taste for life .
just enough time to make a little darling .
and now he 's gone .
i can 't sleep .
marceau is always on my mind .
it is so unfair .
we were planning on getting married .
i would do anything for him to be cured .
don 't worry .
soon , he 'll be well again .
he told me that even if he was to recover , he would no longer marry me .
he said that only because he doesn 't want to leave you with any regrets . - you think so ?
- i 'm sure .
this illness has really changed him .
besides , there 's this other girl , the nurse .
don 't cry , julienne . don 't .
you know , he doesn 't really care about charlotte .
- i don 't know .
i don 't know anymore . - it 's true !
he told me .
don 't worry .
kiss me , olivier .
not like that , you idiot .
marceau !
- not really , no .
i think i 'll go back to paris .
i thought you were going to stay here a few days .
i 'm too close to marceau , here .
victor ?
would you mind taking me to the station ?
i 'm really busy with work , you know . olivier could take you .
he can steer a buggy .
you must not loiter on the way .
you will come home right after .
- you know , i can go by myself . - no .
a young girl should never travel alone .
he 's right .
by the way , the other day in langeac , i saw a used wireless .
- for a good price . - no music in my house !
why not ?
- a bit of music , here and there .
- no , no .
novelties are bearers of misfortune .
it seems you like to dwell in it .
you don 't want water springing from a pipe , so you carry a bucket .
you don 't want music that could uplift our spirits .
you can 't live in the past or among the dead forever , mother .
i can live with mine , thank you .
line 24 , arriving from puy-en-velay , en route to paris via clermont-ferrand , immediate departure , platform 1 .
it was sweet of you to accompany me , olivier .
we 'll meet again in paris , some day ?
victor was right , it 's a pity you are leaving .
- we were happy together .
- you 're a sweetie . - marceau asked me to watch over you .
- and you 've succeeded nicely .
are you crazy , you little pervert !
- what 's the matter ? the other night ... - quiet !
warm-blooded , just like your mother .
- you have no right to say that !
- oh yeah ?
how do you call a woman who had lovers ?
none of your business .
she did as she pleased .
victoria said your mother was a small-time goddess .
it 's not her fault if privat tried to shoot her .
not her fault ? well there 's a good one !
why do you say that ?
my poor olivier !
if you only knew what your mother did to privat .
what did she do to him ?
- tell me , julienne ! - i can 't tell you .
attention , now departing .
go and see privat .
he lives on a big estate called les bruyeres .
he 'll tell you what really happened .
we 'll meet again .
later .
giddy-up !
come on , faster !
giddy-up !
hue , nono !
easy , easy , nono .
whoa !
i 'd like to speak to mr. privat .
it 's very important . yes , i see .
he shouldn 't be long .
you can wait in the living room .
follow me .
it 's your mother , olivier .
a friend of mine made that bust .
she was about to turn 18 .
i thought you wouldn 't want to see me again .
i didn 't come for you .
i need to know something .
- it 's very important .
- i 'm listening .
why did you want to kill my parents .
what did they do to you ?
i was your ... your mother 's first husband . my mother 's first husband ?
your mother couldn 't bring herself to tell you she was divorced . she didn 't want you troubled by that .
we got married before the war .
we were living together and then i was called to the front .
at the same time your father was .
we were childhood friends , all three of us .
when he got injured , in october of 1914 , and was released from duty , your mother took care of him .
i thought they met when father came back wounded from the war ? no . no .
but your mother was indeed his nurse .
months and years went by .
then one day , i received a disheartening letter ... from your mother . she was leaving for paris , with your father .
- it 's not true .
you 're lying ! - no .
you 'll be the only one to know the truth .
a truth i have never revealed . to anyone .
upon reading the letter , i was shattered , forlorn .
i wanted to find your mother .
in the spring of 1917 , during general nivell 's offensives ,
i had volunteered to perform inspections on a fort we had retaken .
i picked up a grenade , unpinned it , then i pushed my arm through a gun slit ,
and held it until my arm blew off .
that 's how i became a war hero .
weeks later , i left the hospital and headed for paris .
with the intent of killing your parents , and turning the gun on myself . there it is .
olivier !
- i hope you 'll forgive me .
- my parents would never have done that !
it 's not their fault , olivier . it 's the war that created this mess .
this can 't be true .
i will never forgive them !
they 're no longer my mother nor my father !
you have no right to judge them !
you 'll understand this later on .
it is possible to love ... and then no longer love .
we 're not masters ...
- shut up !
olivier !
move on , nono ! move on !
giddy-up !
giddy-up !
giddy-up !
olivier ! charlotte ?
what 's going on ? it 's marceau ?
marceau ?
no . don 't worry .
he 's over there , in the car .
how is he ?
they wouldn 't let him go out , but he persuaded the director . he wanted to see you .
they will operate tomorrow .
you 'll see .
he 's weakened , but keeps in good spirits .
so , my little outcast ? - you 're now a shepherd ?
- you 're crazy , marceau .
you should be resting !
but i am resting , here .
don 't say anything to your grandpa ?
let him cherish the image of a young man in perfect health , rather than one of deterioration .
besides , i came for you .
i got your letter .
i needed to talk to you ..
- you didn 't have to come . - i know that .
i wanted to ask you something .
what is it ?
you must forgive your parents , olivier .
do not judge them , as i often did with mine .
since i 've been living with death , i find these judgments so ludicrous .
your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them ? no .
- but look at what they did to mr. privat !
- it 's all the same .
the love they had for each other ... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same medal .
you cannot split them apart .
do you understand ?
remember , olivier .
one day , you said that my life and death wouldn 't have meaning just for me .
so now , i want you to trust me .
it 's the last time ...
you 're crazy , marceau !
we 'll see each other after the operation !
don 't be silly .
do what i say .
promised ?
i know you 're going back to school in paris .
but before you go , i want you to visit your parents ' grave .
and tell them that you love them .
how can i tell them ?
if you put your heart into it , they 'll hear you .
really ?
yes .
i have a book on the language of flowers .
i 'll offer them a rose .
a red rose .
it 's a symbol of love .
crazy love .
bravo .
you see , when you want to .
now , now .
don 't start that again .
we 'll see each other again !
we 'll travel to america .
we 'll go cheer louis armstrong at the cotton club .
we 'll have a great time !
- what do you say , my olive ?
- let 's do it !
courage , my little urchin !
you old fart !
i 'm the editor of " l 'illustration . "
i 'm here for odilon hubert , the algerian mp .
he 's over there .
thank you .
mr. hubert ?
i 'm camille bruyere .
as the first man to represent frenchmen in algeria , my newspaper would like to devote an article to you .
- about algeria ?
- no , about you .
about me ?
a shakespearean tragedy with blood and violence ?
our readers love that , sir .
is that so ?
it 's another country , young man . another world . a land of extremes .
scalding days , freezing nights . the choking smell of goat and jasmine .
let me take notes .
it 's about other religions and peoples .
it 's about arabs , fanatical muslim warriors who only love horses and arms .
that 's great .
how will you explain to your readers the new race of french settlers , the truly exotic mix of corsicans , people from the rouergue , the ariege , the spaniards , jews and maltese ?
let 's give it a try and start at the beginning .
when did you get to algeria ?
i arrived in oran in 1837 with my friend helie toussaint .
i was a medical officer and he was an interpreter .
algeria was a world filled with wild dreams .
everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this newly conquered land .
we 'd been fighting for 7 years .
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 1 .
the emir 's doctor
he 's the guy on the black stallion .
and i , jean-baptiste fremond , will get abd el-kader !
the colonel wanted you to see the interior of algeria .
you 'll have your fill .
wait for my signal to shoot .
i 've been in the field for 3 years and i haven 't killed a single arab yet !
if you shoot , you 'll get court martialed !
crap !
shit !
the sly old dog !
curse your mother 's religion !
let him die , doc !
take care of our wounded .
- he 's a man like you and me .
- maybe like you , not me .
you 're naive .
you won 't live long if you keep this up .
hey interpreter , ask this guy where they spent the night .
who gave them food and shelter ?
tell him i 'll shoot him in the head if he lies .
- temouchent . - shit !
- let 's go .
- what about him ?
bring him .
i 'll show him what i 'm made of .
breteuil !
dumas !
shit !
savages !
burn that damn village !
set the whole town ablaze !
cut down the trees !
burn their crops !
those brutes must die !
- take them all !
- even the women ?
i said " them all , " lieutenant !
women and children too ! - why the women ?
- arabs buy and sell women like cattle .
the ugly ones become slaves .
they invented razzias , lieutenant , not us .
the only thing arabs respect is strength .
that 's the only thing those fanatics understand .
strength .
imagine our despair .
helie and i were saint-simonians .
we hadn 't come to algeria for this , but to unite the east and the west like we 'd sworn to do a few months earlier in paris .
you are now brothers through saint-simon . apostles of a new christianity .
we saint-simonians , who follow the teachings of our master , the late count of saint-simon , a remarkable economist and philosopher , want to build a new society based on progress .
engineers , polytechnicians and bankers , we 'll spread our message around the world .
let 's leave for africa , for the regency of algiers over which the french flag now flies .
let 's all swear to unite the east 's spiritual values with the material ones of the west .
we swear !
we swear !
hello , ferdinand .
mother , you know ferdinand de lesseps .
mr. de lesseps .
he 's going to egypt with father enfantin to build a canal linking the mediterranean to the red sea .
a canal ?
what ever for ?
so india-bound boats won 't need to go around africa .
those are the pereire brothers , very rich bankers .
mother , this is my friend helie toussaint .
we 're going to algeria together .
he 's an interpreter and i 'll act as medical officer in oran .
we 'll build a new world over there , madam .
all men will be equal , regardless of race or religion .
on the barbary coast ! my god !
have a seat , mother .
excuse me .
- i don 't know that friend . - he 's a new one .
allow me to congratulate you , mrs. hubert .
your son odilon is a good boy and a zealous apostle of our saint-simonian cause .
- i fear for him , sir .
- why is that ?
you 're sending him to algeria , a war- and cholera-ridden land .
of course .
but it 's an exciting mission :
to wake up slumbering islam and create a new society .
my only son with arabs !
- we 're to meet the colonel .
- he 's busy at the moment .
- we 'll wait here .
- as you wish .
did you know colonel lamoriciere was saint-simonian too ?
i 'm not surprised .
he went to the polytechnique , so he must be in favor of progress .
- goodbye , mr. bensimon . - goodbye .
interpreter helie toussaint .
medical officer , major odilon hubert .
at ease .
i know .
father enfantin told me about your coming to algeria .
welcome to this beautiful country where much remains to be done .
follow me .
i 'll brief you .
we 're occupying the ports of algiers , bone and oran .
our only intention , at first , was to occupy the coastline , like the turks .
that isn 't what we saw when we arrived , colonel .
this is clearly a war to conquer and exterminate the arabs .
i know .
some parisian newspapers wrote that we 're more barbarian than the barbarians .
they 're unfortunately right .
but whose fault is it ?
abd el-kader has started a holy war against us .
he swore to throw us into the sea .
he 's waged a vast , cruel and ruthless war against us .
we did invade his land .
we 're dealing with religions fanatics ! we have to dominate them , or they 'll drive us out and the british will take our place .
the french government doesn 't know what it wants .
ten governor-generals in 6 years !
we don 't have enough men to end this once and for all .
barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million arabs in a country 3 times the size of france .
it 's ridiculous !
yet , the saint-simonian mission is clear :
we want to help the arabs , to protect their language and their religion . we wish to let them run their own country and help them gradually take in the values of modern western civilization .
excuse me , colonel ...
how is that different from colonization ?
the land , toussaint .
the land .
we need to leave it to the arabs who are its rightful farmers .
our role is to build factories , roads and railroads .
that 's why i created the first arab offices in this land and why i set up the first zouave regiment , made up of muslim volunteers who are now our brothers in arms .
i would like to volunteer in such a regiment .
not now .
i have more important work for you .
bugeaud will be in oran next week . his mission is to seek peace with abd el-kader .
you speak arabic , toussaint ?
i can pass for egyptian .
very well .
you 'll remain incognito in the native city .
there , you 'll contact abd el-kader 's man .
you want me to spy on the arabs ?
no , we 're doing it for peace , for a good cause .
as for you , hubert , you 'll handle the cholera epidemic , which has hit our troops very hard .
- and the population even harder .
- i know . hubert will treat everyone equally .
be careful , doctor .
the other doctors before you all died of cholera .
- what about you , sister ?
- god is watching over me .
leila ?
this is leila , one of our orphans .
- she speaks arabic and french .
- hello , miss .
hello , doctor .
he 's dehydrated .
tell him to drink a lot . boiled water .
no need to be so formal with me .
i can teach you arabic .
he needs a new bandage .
i will be chaperoning your lessons with leila .
why , sister ?
don 't you trust me ?
i need to learn arabic too .
your convent 's been here over 200 years - and you don 't speak arabic ?
- i need the theory .
cover him up .
he 's in a sorry state .
i 'm discouraged , doctor . they keep dying .
i pray every day , but ...
medicine is making progress .
we now know it spreads through water .
we 'll find a cure .
try turpentine .
your protege is great !
when the poor girl was little , arabs killed her parents before her eyes .
her family 's from spain .
but she looks and speaks arabic .
her grandmother was a " mamma rosa . "
a long time ago , a boat with 10 of our spanish sisters ran aground here .
our sisters were all sold as slaves to kabyle and turkish chiefs .
the mother superior was named maria rosa , so the offspring of those forced marriages were named " mamma rosas . "
you shouldn 't laugh .
- forgive me , sister .
- we raised leila as one of our own .
tell him children have to drink a lot .
- he said , " may allah bless you . "
- get a stretcher .
hurry !
want a woman ?
you had that one yesterday .
she 's no longer a virgin .
let me in . let me in !
- what 're you doing here ?
- you 'll blow my cover .
everyone knows who you are .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission .
that 's not true .
the colonel told me to blend in , so i am .
you 've no idea what delights the east has to offer .
everything is here to please men .
these women have been raised to fulfill our every desire .
odilon , i 'm uniting with the east on a daily basis .
- want to try ?
- have you lost your mind ?
you 'll come around .
this isn 't quite the spiritual union our saint-simonian brothers had in mind .
the colonel sent me .
he hasn 't heard from you in over a month .
you risk getting court martialed .
i found a way to contact abd el-kader .
trust me .
stay .
special tricks , huh ?
i know who you are .
so do i .
why are you spying on us ?
i 'm not spying .
i 'm bringing peace .
we also seek peace .
but peace is worth nothing without freedom .
france is willing to respect your freedom . - if you stop the war . - it 's not up to me .
- tell your leader .
- only allah has the power - to decide
- i know .
allah has a lot of responsibilities .
- i 'm sure he could use our help .
- i 'll do my best .
- tell me about bahia .
- she 's beautiful .
- i know .
i saw her .
- she 's nice .
- haven 't you had enough women ?
- she 's different .
i 'm bahia .
my father , si kaddour , sent me to tell you emir abd el-kader , the leader of the holy war , is ready to broker peace .
thank you .
you 've brought me great news .
you speak french well .
my father didn 't have a son , so he taught me to read and write like a boy .
i have to go .
that means " i love you . "
- excuse me ?
- right .
- it could be useful .
yes .
but more sensuous .
yes , again .
hello , everyone !
i have great news !
- any new developments ?
- i 'm in love .
crazy in love !
what do you think ?
it 's not what you think , odilon .
this is serious .
she 's from a big tent . - excuse me ?
- from a noble family .
she 's beautiful , smart ...
- who is she ?
- si kaddour 's daughter .
- bahia ?
- you know her ?
very well .
we studied together .
that 's fantastic , leila !
you can help me .
go tell her i love her and want to marry her .
- you want to marry an ...
- an arab .
so ?
i won 't be the first .
the wife of the general in constantine is arab .
no , she 's kabyle .
leila ...
you know her , so go see her and tell her i love her .
please . i beg you ! do it for me .
arranging marriages is for old women .
she 's your friend , she 'll listen to you .
fine , i 'll play matchmaker .
just for you !
- and your mission ?
- that 's the other good news .
abd el-kader is ready to negotiate .
i notified lamoriciere , who informed bugeaud .
- there 's going to be a truce .
- you don 't know arabs .
it 's a ruse . they 'll keep fighting .
you 're one to talk , leila .
aren 't you arab ?
not at all . i 'm kabyle .
i 'm not muslim , but christian .
anyway ... religion is all that matters here .
it 's more important than blood , more important than anything !
you think he really loves me ?
he 's been with so many women .
do you love him ? i don 't know .
my father wants to give me to a friend of his .
he may be the love of your life .
all i know is i want to be his wife - and bear his children .
- sounds like love .
you know it 's up to the men .
my father won 't let me marry an infidel .
that can be arranged .
he adores you .
i don 't even know if odilon loves me .
i had to kiss him .
go see old zara for a love potion .
we already have one : this , - this and this .
- leila , you sound like a whore . that 's what we are !
fathers sell us like sheep .
don 't say that .
women serve men and bear their children .
i 'll choose my own husband .
- i 've already chosen .
- you love him ?
i want him . i 'll get him .
so ?
she loves you .
she 'll marry you on one condition .
- anything !
- she can only marry a muslim .
- that doesn 't bode well .
- there 's a way :
become muslim .
why not ?
go see the imam , say , " allah is great , " muhammad is his prophet " and it 's done !
why not ?
i 've already thought about it .
islam is a good religion .
no priests , no bishops , no pope .
just you and god .
anyway , it 's the same god for everyone .
yes , but ... circumcision ?
circumcision .
don 't worry .
the barber will give your willy a clean cut .
plus , he uses an english shaver .
sure you want to get circumcised ?
i have to to become muslim .
let me do it instead of that butcher .
he 's not a butcher , he 's a barber .
that 's worse .
you don 't know the words that need to be said .
i 'm giving a part of myself to god .
want me to go with you ?
helie !
i envied him in a way .
he threw himself into everything , while i , the good jesuit student , weighed the pros and cons for so long , i 'd never decide .
should i marry leila ?
she was beautiful and bewitching , but she scared me like this country did .
done .
- we 're brothers now .
- go !
the brute had to do it 3 times !
told you so .
i 'll bandage you at the hospital .
i 'm muslim like you , si kaddour .
you gave me your word .
" i 'll give you my daughter if you become muslim . "
will you give her to me now ?
i gave you my word , so i will . as long as the uncles agree .
what 's it to them ?
they 're the elders , wise men .
they decide for the family .
it 's tradition .
are you circumcised ?
what i wouldn 't do for you , bahia ...
so , are you done inspecting me ?
they agree .
i 'm grateful .
you can have bahia , but there 's the dowry .
the dowry .
how much ?
- 1,000 francs .
- alright .
and 50 sheep .
fifty sheep ?
where would i find those ?
buy them .
from whom ?
me .
if you want to .
- congratulations ! - thanks .
bugeaud signed a peace treaty with abd el-kader .
the treaty of tafna recognizes his authority over 2 / 3 of algeria .
the emir set up his camp on the tagdempt plateau , between mascara and the ouarsenis mountains .
i 'm worried , hubert .
why , colonel ?
you wanted everyone to stay where they belonged .
i hear he 's a loyal fellow .
he can 't stand our presence on muslim ground .
it 's a question of religion , which is sacred .
don 't forget , hubert , that the emir is a prophet as well as a military man and a poet .
only islam is capable of producing such men .
we sent him a delegation .
he requested a doctor to treat his sick mother .
i appointed you .
go to him . try to get in his good graces and keep me apprised each week .
you can count on me , colonel .
enjoy your dinner , last night ?
yes , colonel .
on behalf of my master , emir abd el-kader , prince of the faithful , defender of the prophet 's religion , welcome .
on behalf of france and science , i came to help the emir and his family .
our emir is sad .
his mother , the holy and revered zohra , is seriously ill .
if you cure her , he 'll shower you with gifts .
i don 't need gifts .
your master 's gratitude will be ample reward .
- she 's burning up !
- it often happens to her .
it 's malaria .
- then it 's up to god .
- there 's a new medication :
quinine .
i prepared a potion with quina bark .
careful . it 's quite bitter .
she must take a sip every 2 hours .
i 'll be back tomorrow .
this is your house .
just ask if you need anything .
the emir will see you tomorrow morning .
i 'll come get you .
rest in peace .
go see the french doc . you 'll do his cooking and cleaning .
the doctor is a spy .
watch his every move .
bring me anything that he writes .
got it ?
what will you give me for that ?
like she said , your uncle wants me for his harem .
your uncle 's rich .
i 'll find you a husband .
young or old , but rich .
you 're pretty , you 'll get your pick .
who are these prisoners ?
the leaders of a rebel tribe .
the ben zetoun .
welcome to my home .
have a seat .
i 'm happy that french science could serve the mother of the prince of the faithful .
it 's a good example of what we can bring your country .
medicine was invented by an arab .
i plan on setting up a university .
our doctors will be as good as french ones .
why waste time when france offered you to skip centuries and enter the modern world .
a new world could come out of the union of the east and the west .
arabs weren 't made to sow wheat and build cities .
- we 're nomads , sons of the wind .
- nothing solid is built on wind .
nothing solid is built without god .
god is with me . i only listen to him .
he forbids me from letting any muslim live - under christian domination .
- we don 't want to dominate you , but to bring you the benefits of civilization and progress .
when god wants to hurt an ant , he gives it wings .
full of pride and joy , it takes to the sky .
then a little bird sees it and swallows it .
we 'll be friends if everyone stays where they belong .
we value freedom ! only a holy war can bring freedom and independence .
a holy war never required anyone butchering their enemy , like i saw at ain temouchent .
we 've made peace .
come see me whenever you please .
you 'll be welcome wherever i am .
this is from the emir .
it 's yours .
i can 't accept it .
refusing a gift is a grave insult .
- who 's she ?
- a servant for you .
- where 's my servant ahmed ?
- he asked to join the army of the faithful .
naouel 's a better cook .
naouel .
you speak french ?
where are you from ?
kabylia .
my father worked for a french lieutenant at the arab office .
the emir 's soldiers came to our village .
they killed the lieutenant , ...
don 't worry , i 'll treat you well .
you 're my father and mother to me .
good night .
where will you sleep ?
- next door .
- there 's no bed .
i sleep on the floor .
call me if you need anything .
wait .
stay a while .
you smell nice .
let me guess ...
close your eyes .
good morning .
so , the coffee 's turkish , the milk is from a goat , but the bread is mine .
happy ?
- don 't kiss me like that .
- you 're my master , i 'm yours .
this is :
naouel was the mistress-servant every man secretly dreams of .
i dove head first into the bewitching world of islam , which mixed nobility , poetry and cruelty , and where god commanded every move .
i was far from everything , elsewhere . i never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life .
the emir had just come back from a long expedition in the sahara .
you were right , colonel .
he 's been taking advantage , these last 2 years , of the false peace to rule over the other tribes .
he 's plundered the kabylia , the ouarsenis , the titteri and now the sahara .
will he ever unite these dispersed tribes ?
if he does , it 'll be in spite of us .
the women at the souk are saying the war with the french is about to start again .
i 'm scared .
if there 's a war , you 'll leave without me .
of course not .
i 'll take you with me .
there 's a rumor that hostilities will resume against the french .
the emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infantry ,
2,000 cavalry , 20 field guns , and 240 gunners .
add to that , 60,000 irregulars armed with french rifles they got off our dead or from their prisoners , and english guns the british consul sold them .
odilon ?
helie ?
- i 'm so happy to see you !
- so am i. how are you ?
well .
have a seat .
- three stripes !
bravo !
- same to you .
haven 't you heard ? you 've been promoted .
this is such a remote place .
- hey ! she 's stealing a letter !
- no , it 's naouel .
she brings my letters to the legation .
your servant ?
- you trust her ?
- of course . well , she 's more than my servant .
she 's my girlfriend .
- are you kidding me ?
- i 'm in love .
good thing i 'm here .
you 're so naive , odilon .
she 's here to spy on you .
that 's what the arabs do !
can we talk about something else ?
what brings you here ?
i 'm here with the major .
we came to see abd el-kader to prevent a new outbreak .
what 's going on ?
our generals have captured constantine .
to join algiers and constantine , they occupied a territory abd el-kader thinks is his .
is he right ?
we 're obviously being dishonest .
so are the arabs .
abd el-kader keeps saying that god willing , he 'll throw the french into the sea .
after all , this is his land not ours .
if we leave , algeria will go back to chaos .
what about the union of the east and the west ?
we need peace first .
and freedom and equality for arabs . not a forced union .
winning is all our generals want .
they want to subdue the natives .
believe me , you should head back to oran .
- leila is waiting for you .
- how 's bahia ?
i forgot to tell you . i have a son .
- really ?
- ishmael .
he 's almost a year old .
i hope you 'll attend his circumcision .
i wouldn 't miss it .
the french didn 't keep their word .
the duke of orleans and marshal valee crossed the iron gates and violated my territory .
it 's an affront to our dignity .
i wrote to louis-philippe , the king of france .
he didn 't even reply .
my men are in favor of a holy war .
the hissing of bullets is worth more than freshwater .
that would be a mistake .
france is stronger .
it has soldiers , canons , ships .
i am not scared .
allah is with me .
my friends and i want freedom and equality for every algerian and french person .
perhaps , but it 's your generals who lay down the law .
winning is like saltwater , the more you drink ,
- the thirstier you get .
- no matter who wins , a lot of men will fall under enemy fire .
it 's fate , not bullets , that kill .
muslims are ready to die for their faith .
the koran says , " heaven lies in the shade of swords . "
i chose the honorable path : war .
warn your people , so they can 't say they weren 't given fair warning .
hadj hamou will take you to the french outpost .
may allah watch over you and your family .
i 'll never forget you saved my mother .
may allah guide you towards fair and honorable peace .
farewell .
naouel ?
- where 's naouel ?
- she 's gone .
- where ?
- back to the harem .
what ?
she 's leaving with me .
you can 't expect a muslim to follow an infidel .
- i want to see her .
- she doesn 't want to see you .
you 're lying !
she wants to leave with me .
you 're naive , lieutenant hubert .
i sent her here to spy on you .
i don 't believe you .
you 're lying .
she showed me all your letters .
" 8,000 infantry , 2,000 cavalry , 20 field guns . "
you 're well informed .
get over it .
you 're a soldier .
you should know that a man who trusts a woman isn 't a real man .
fight me !
you 're the emir 's guest .
he ordered me to see to your safety .
hospitality is sacred to muslims .
you 're my guest .
i have to protect you .
- i owe you my life .
- i 'll kill you next time .
... with sugar , milk , dates and raisins is a delight !
- leila will be eating with us .
- i see , it 's a conspiracy .
you should make up your mind .
she 's perfect for you .
- don 't you like her ?
- of course i do .
so marry her !
don 't be like every single officer here who shacks up with a broad , but won 't be seen in public with her .
sorry , i ... you 're right .
it 's all in the past .
- let 's talk shop .
excuse me , i must take care of ishmael .
i 'll join you .
leila , i wanted to tell you ...
what ?
firstly ... i have something to confess .
the kabyle girl ?
i know .
helie told me .
he should mind his own business .
it 's different between us , isn 't it ?
so you 'd be willing to ...
ladies and gentlemen , i raise my glass to captain hubert who just earned a well-deserved third stripe . to his lovely wife , our hospital 's head nurse , whose beauty and competence will support her husband 's brilliant career .
our best wishes to the newlyweds .
their union is celebrated under favorable auspices .
our troops just crushed the regular army of abd el-kader , who wanted to challenge us to a battle .
but in vain .
his troops were annihilated , thanks to my friend , colonel yusuf .
ladies and gentlemen , to love and victory !
you 're very optimistic , general .
abd el-kader has lost the battle but not the war .
he started a guerilla war and is stirring up the tribes .
here and there , perhaps .
but trust me , he lost face and therefore the game .
it 's only a question of time now .
bugeaud was named governor-general .
he 's bringing 100,000 men .
we 'll be able to pull out all the stops .
things are clear to paris .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
we 'll turn it into a modern country .
what are they doing ?
- how do you like it ?
- it 's sublime .
- thank you .
- want something to drink ? - two granitas .
- two granitas , please .
- where did you get that ?
- in a jewish store .
- it suits you .
- thank you .
i prefer north african dresses . they 're more mysterious .
eroticism relies on mystery .
is it true that abd el-kader is 20 km from algiers ?
he was . he raided the mitidja and vanished without a trace .
we haven 't seen the last of him .
this morning , we met the royal committee for the development of algeria .
there 'll be a railroad from algiers to blida .
the mineralogical map says we have coal ...
we 're late , odilon .
we 're expected at noon .
your kepi .
- wait for us for lunch . - yes .
good day to you , sir .
colonization is at a standstill .
what 's the use of conquering land if no one settles there ?
no one wants to settle on a foreign land that hasn 't been completely pacified .
it will be , lamoriciere , it will be !
i swear we 'll take out the trash by any means necessary !
but i won 't do it for swiss or austrian settlers ! those ignorant drunks !
you 're right , general .
to make the most out of these huge areas the nomadic arabs have neglected , we need big capitalist companies who possess great means .
we recommend it , as the modern and effective way .
fiddlesticks !
that 's typical of your saint-simonian friends .
a bunch of dreamers and visionaries !
you see , lamoriciere , i haven 't been to the polytechnique , unlike yourself .
i 'm a soldier and a farmer .
i learned everything on my limousin farm .
the mitidja isn 't the beauce .
may i respectfully point out , general , that the limousin isn 't the mitidja either .
believe it or not , captain toussaint , i had noticed that .
" ense et aratro . " it 's my motto .
with the sword and plow .
like cincinnatus , the roman farmer-soldier . veterans can settle here after their service is done :
plow , horse , rifle .
i 'll even give them wives .
natives ?
my chief of staff , who 's retired , is now the mayor of toulon .
he can get me servants , widows , single women ... you catch my drift .
germaine , do you take gustave to be your husband , to be faithful unto him and be part of the church ?
- i do .
- gustave , do you take germaine to be your wife , to be faithful unto her and be part of the church ?
- you are now joined in holy matrimony .
here are your rings .
poor girl .
- i hear she 's an orphan .
- who knows , she might be happy .
fat chance !
it 's the luck of the draw .
- germain , do you take ...
- know what they 're doing ?
they 've giving land to young soldiers who 've completed 5 of their 7 years of service .
- so ?
- so they won 't leave .
they 'll have to spend at least 2 more years here .
here is your title of ownership , a plow and a horse to go with it , and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards .
madam , here is the key to your house .
live happily and prosper .
here is your title of ownership , a plow and a horse to go with it , and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards .
- thank you , general .
- madam , here is the key - to your house . - thank you .
live happily and prosper .
friends ! after having conquered this land in the name of france , you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children .
i wish you all the best .
drum roll .
we 're stealing the arabs ' land , general .
no need to exaggerate .
they weren 't using it .
but small-scale farming won 't turn algeria into beauce .
if abd el-kader lets us .
the governor chose to send 3 units after him .
i 'm to command one .
with all due respect , i 'm not sure i 'd like to join the hunt .
you don 't have a choice , toussaint .
i 've just received word you 'll be serving under the young duke of aumale who 'll command yusuf 's unit .
you 'll be his interpreter and hubert , his medical officer .
the king 's son !
that 's rather flattering .
i regret losing you , but it 'll be good for your careers .
colonel yusuf spotted the smalah .
it eluded us twice in 4 days , but we have it now .
it 's here ! by the taguine well . the troops , the women and children .
how on earth can they move camp that quickly ?
i don 't know , my lord .
it 's incredible .
is abd el-kader with them ?
i didn 't want to sound the alarm by getting too close .
- when abd el-kader isn 't there , he leaves 500 men .
we have enough cavalrymen .
let 's go .
we should wait for the infantry . they 're 3 hours away .
sound the charge , lieutenant .
my lord , the duke of aumale told me to inform you that he captured abd el-kader 's smalah at noon on may 16 .
we left with the cavalry at dawn and encountered them at noon .
i 'll never forget this extraordinaire event .
get to the point , my friend .
the african chasseurs went around the smalah to take it from the rear while colonel yusuf launched a frontal attack .
chaos and panic ensued . there was a stampede .
good .
very well indeed .
what about abd el-kader ?
he wasn 't there , general .
general ! we captured 300 notables and warlords , their families , horses and sheep , and abd el-kader 's war chest :
a wonderful booty .
it almost cost the duke of aumale his life .
coming , hubert ?
- so ?
- all hope is lost , my lord .
guard !
move away !
let the women and child go and i 'll surrender !
take them away .
you saved my life , captain .
is there anything you want ?
give me the 3 prisoners .
they 're yours .
she wants to see you .
she 's waiting for you outside .
- why did you abandon me , odilon ?
- abandon you ?
you spied on me and betrayed me .
you believed him ?
i knew it .
hadj hamou kidnapped me and put me in his harem .
and the letters ?
he only managed to get one from me .
i 'm here , odilon , to tell you
i never betrayed you .
but you doubted me .
no .
you didn 't love me enough .
is that your son ?
ours .
aissa .
no one must ever know , otherwise hadj hamou will kill my son and i .
i 'm his wife .
he put me in his harem .
he never asked me anything .
hadj hamou is a good man ,
he 's a good husband and father .
aissa and i are his .
i simply wanted you to know .
helie told me you 're married .
i am .
i had misjudged her .
- she 's a good person .
your worlds are too different .
- you 're one to talk .
- it 's not the same for me .
you think a man can love several women at once ?
muslims can have up to 4 women .
but there 's always a favorite .
some must sometimes love 2 women equally .
i 'm done .
come in .
you wanted to kill me and almost did .
- it wasn 't god 's will .
- i know i owe you my life . so you 're free to go .
- i 'll take up arms again .
- that 's your right .
- i 'm indebted to you .
- no , we 're even now .
set naouel and the child free .
we 're now bound for life , you and i .
it is our destiny .
i thought the battle of the smalah would end the war , but abd el-kader would be on the run for another 4 years .
for 4 years , helie and i witnessed yusuf and lamoriciere 's hellish razzias which were answered by piles of severed french heads .
the emir fled to morocco , where he was followed by bugeaud who won the battle of isly .
the following year , abd el-kader butchered a french battalion at sidi-brahim .
on christmas eve 1847 , after having resisted one of the most powerful countries on earth for 15 years , the emir admitted defeat .
it was god 's will .
budge call !
accept this horse as submission .
it 's the last one i 'll ride .
i will now go on foot .
i accept your homage to france , which grants you its protection , as a sign that the past has been forgiven .
you cured my holy mother .
may god watch over you and yours .
had i had men like yours , i 'd now be in algiers .
since you defeated me , you 're the only person i can entrust with the weapons i used in the last 15 years of fighting you .
i will not be needing them anymore .
i will devote the rest of my life to god .
god is great .
past enemies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart .
you may see me as alive , but i am dead .
squadron leader hubert , on behalf of his majesty louis-philippe , i appoint you knight of the legion of honor .
congratulations , hubert , and thank you again .
squadron leader toussaint , on behalf of his majesty , i appoint you knight of the legion of honor .
congratulations .
end of the proclamation !
- congratulations , dear friends .
- thank you .
you deserve it .
a lot remains to be done in this great country .
we 'll build it instead of destroy it .
you know there 's fighting in paris right now .
there 's talk of a second republic .
so we 'll finally see that republic .
- what will happen to algeria ?
- a republic means liberty , equality and fraternity for every man .
translation :
magenta baribeau epilogue
welcome to algeria , where much remains to be done .
the saint-simonians ' mission is clear :
we want to protect the arabs ' language and religion .
i came to help the emir 's family with french knowledge .
may allah protect them .
i chose the honorable path : war .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission .
i found a way to contact adbelkader .
violence is the only thing arabs respect .
these savages must die !
this is a genocide , not a war .
some parisian newspapers even wrote that we 're the barbarians .
a toast to his lovely wife .
our best wishes to the newlyweds .
you think a man can love several women simultaneously ?
there 's always a favorite .
i never betrayed you .
no one must ever know , otherwise hadj hamou will kill my son and i .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
you 're the only person i can entrust with the weapons i used to fight you these last 15 years .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 2 .
death 's fiancee
mother ...
jeremy ?
emile and jeanne must do the homework that i spent last night preparing .
thank you .
had we stayed in oran , instead of moving to this godforsaken place , our children could go to school and get a normal education .
as soon as we have the money , we 'll send them to the algiers boarding school .
did you know that the boy with typhoid died ?
i know .
i did all i could .
i hope they won 't catch it .
they played with him .
is there any milk , djamila ?
not that one .
i don 't like goat milk .
it 's sour .
there aren 't any cows here , sweetie .
we wouldn 't be here if your father hadn 't left the army .
where is he going , mother ?
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republican and pro-arab .
nothing to be ashamed of .
i was a republican .
the ' 48 revolution hit paris , then oran .
i believed in the new republic . and i still do . and i 'm most certainly pro-arab .
the europeans mixed up revolution and beatings .
i paid the price after napoleon iii 's december ' 51 coup .
don 't stay there . you have plenty of room .
spread it out !
leila wanted us to leave for france .
but leaving algeria was out of the question .
so i rented this farm from a settler from ariege who became disheartened and left with a bad fever .
" these dates are excellent . "
period .
" the umbrella is ... " a nice shade " of red . "
- what 's wrong , jeanne ?
- my stomach hurts .
you don 't have a fever .
yaouled wrote " umprella . "
- with a p !
- stop teasing yaouled .
i 'd like to see you write arabic !
he can 't write arabic either !
don 't listen to him . you 've made tremendous progress .
- he made 15 mistakes yesterday .
- you made 12 !
why isn 't ishem here ?
she 's a girl .
her father won 't allow it .
- why not ?
- she might get ideas .
alright . let 's continue .
the camel has big teeth .
yaouled , make sure your sheep don 't eat my wife 's flowers .
why are you calling me yaouled ?
i 'm ahmed .
you 're oran 's yaouled to me .
go get the others , ahmed , i 've got a surprise .
try them on . you 'll be able to work faster .
against thorns and rocks .
your week 's pay .
kader . cherif .
a gift .
clean the stables and the horses ' bedding like i showed you .
boss ! mr. charmasson is coming .
the delorme farm was attacked this morning .
you 're a doc , - there might be some wounded .
- go get my kit .
antoine ?
marie ?
savages ! madmen !
come .
there 's nothing we can do here .
go get help at the village . we 'll give them a nice burial .
madmen !
what 's the army waiting for ?
you know they hate settlers .
they 're savages !
the only solution is to eradicate them , like the americans did with the indians .
this is their land .
they were wasting it .
don 't make excuses for them !
i 'm not !
i 'm only trying to understand .
there 's nothing to understand , hubert !
their own brothers ...
why ? why !
" hadjouts " kill infidels and traitors
- so they can go to heaven . - bullshit !
that 's what the marabout said .
it 's holy war , " jihad . "
the man who kills goes to heaven .
why are they wearing their shoes around their necks ?
their feet hurt .
they prefer going barefoot .
- but they cost me a fortune !
- good .
they won 't get used .
the workers want to invite you and your wife to thank you .
there 's way too much .
we can 't eat all this .
politeness dictates you have to eat a lot .
then you burp and say that you 're full .
he 'll be pleased .
this is stupid .
they probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning .
- they 're generous and behaving like lords .
it 's delicious .
he has trachoma .
we have to do something .
he can come to the farm whenever he wants .
it 's because of marie . - it 's a race .
- they should close the valve .
that 's right , blame allah .
- you 're not married ?
- i 'm not rich enough .
wash his eyes everyday or he 'll become blind .
always wash children 's hands and faces .
- we don 't have much water .
- come get some at the farm .
not too tired ?
are you due soon ?
mother ...
jeanne is crying .
what 's wrong ?
what 's going on ?
typhoid fever !
i knew it .
she 'll die !
- calm down .
we 'll treat her .
- stop it ! i 'm a nurse !
everyone around is dying of cholera , typhoid and dysentery !
you 're exaggerating .
428 people died at the " funduq " last year .
and 94 in boufarik .
the mitidja is a rotten swamp !
the arabs were right calling it " death 's fiancee . "
if the mosquitoes don 't get us , hadjouts will slit our throats
- and we 'll all die ! - enough !
you 're exhausted .
go to bed .
i 'll take care of jeanne .
yes , i 'm exhausted .
i can 't stand it .
i want to leave .
i 'll leave with the kids if you want to stay .
how will you get by ?
we don 't have any money .
i 'll find work as a nurse or as a maid .
the children will go to school .
i want to leave .
then leave !
i can 't stand your constant whining !
come with us . i beg you !
no .
i belong here .
- hurry , mother !
i 'll go see the chief physician at the mustafa hospital .
he agreed to hire me .
- he 's a good man .
- i hope you 'll enjoy yourself .
algiers is full of thieves and adventurers .
will you come visit ?
i 'll visit the children . time permitting .
take them to blida .
the army has set up convoys to algiers .
goodbye , sweetie .
goodbye , emile .
- bye , djamila .
- we never should have come here .
i know .
take care of yourself .
gee up !
i 've had enough of paris .
it 's so gray and expensive here .
i don 't have any friends .
why don 't we go home to algiers ?
i hear leila and her children are there .
- what about odilon ?
- he stayed on the farm .
i don 't get him .
we always said :
the land is for the arabs , commerce , industry and mines for the french .
you 're not listening to me .
i don 't feel at home here .
the children are teased at school because they 're muslim and the salesgirls don 't respect me .
i 'm fighting for you , the children and the algerians , so people will respect your religion , values and the color of your skin .
algeria 's fate is being decided here in paris .
we 've been here for years and no one listened to you .
the republic no longer exists . the republic no longer exists .
this is an empire , but nothing has changed .
you 're wrong .
remember fleury ?
- the young lieutenant ?
- he 's a general now ,
his majesty 's closest advisor .
i sent him my pamphlets and my book .
he read them to the emperor .
it 'll happen , you 'll see .
then we 'll go home ? i promise .
we 'll go home to algeria .
i love you , bahia .
so it doesn 't matter where we are .
you 're right .
my dear toussaint , we have good news for you .
they 're about to start building the algiers-blida railroad .
our friend fournel is surveying algeria 's mineral resources . - he sent his report .
- quite promising .
- we plan to invest .
- large sums .
thank you , sirs .
with your help , algeria will become
- a modern country .
- apologies for my tardiness .
we 're making headway . the emperor freed adbelkader and authorized him to leave france for turkey .
as the duke of aumale and general lamoriciere had promised him when he surrendered over 5 years ago .
despite this promise , france kept him prisoner - all these years . - i know , i know .
that was during king louis-philippe 's reign .
the emperor made amends .
he brought adbelkader to longchamp races , the opera , awarded him the legion of honor .
we 're now best friends .
won 't his liberation fuel algeria 's holy war ?
he promised never to take up arms against france .
the only way to ensure peace in algeria is to make it an independent colony where all algerians would be equal citizens .
the emperor is in favor of that .
he spent most of his exile in england and admires
- british institutions .
- so what 's he waiting for ? it 's time to give that territory its own statute .
he has other worries :
russia , italy ...
didn 't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that algeria was and would remain a french province ?
isn 't this matter already closed ?
i hope not .
wanting arabs to abide by french rules would be a mistake .
they have different customs and values and another religion .
grab a plate . eat with me .
no , it 's pork .
- i can 't eat it .
- there must be some chicken too .
thank you .
straight ! you want a straight line !
get out of here !
i said leave !
there you are .
can you tell that idiot to leave my land ?
these darn nomads don 't respect private property .
of course .
they don 't know what that is .
what he say ?
that it 's communal land that belongs to everyone .
are you kidding ?
he knows i bought it from the government .
scram !
look at that strange set-up .
it 's a great concept .
the camel is strong , but doesn 't walk straight .
the donkey does .
- it 's quite ingenious .
- i see you 're still pro-arab . they 're bad neighbors .
so you sent your wife and kids to algiers ?
- she wanted to leave .
- can 't blame her .
this is a hard place for women and children .
come see me tomorrow .
i 'll be planting a liberty tree .
we can have a drink .
it 'll take your mind off things .
friends , this liberty tree is just like those we planted in france during the ' 48 revolution , a symbol of our faith in the republic .
napoleon iii desecrated the second republic and deported 12,000 of us to these wild african lands .
why ?
because guerin stood on the highest barricade at the faubourg saint-antoine .
because roucaries refused to use his journalistic talents to serve the usurper .
bravo !
and you , ludovic , because the townspeople had elected you republican mayor !
they wanted to break us , but we and our spanish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this algerian land are capable of !
let 's turn this rotten mitidja into a garden that we can one day transform into a new republic .
i propose the creation of a settlers association and a newspaper , " the settler 's voice , "
that roucaries will manage .
long live the republic !
music !
don 't forget republican principles mean liberty , equality and fraternity for everyone , including arabs .
you must be kidding , hubert .
these savages cut our compatriots ' throats !
you want to turn them into frenchmen ?
you abolished slavery in ' 48 .
be coherent .
arabs are men like you and i. we 're all brothers .
what a sermon !
leave that to the arab representatives .
beni sassen 's kaid is throwing a party next week .
captain audran invited us .
come with , you 'll see .
you 're going ?
it 's id al-adha , an important muslim holiday . we sacrifice sheep to commemorate abraham 's sacrifice .
wasn 't abraham jewish ?
judaism , christianity and islam are sister religions ,
talking about sheep ...
you know it 's the nomads ' main source of income .
they say they don 't have enough grazing fields .
audran , i see what you 're getting at .
their sheep grazing on our land is a real problem .
they trample our seedlings and eat our wheat .
one flock of sheep grazed on your land .
we paid the fine .
they 're nomads . they can go elsewhere .
each tribe follows its own route .
setting foot on another tribe 's land could start a war .
that 's their problem .
you 're not making my job any easier .
we 're trying to build trust with tribes loyal to our country but the encampment policy , which was adopted against the army 's advice and gave you land that belonged to the arabs , is turning the tribes against us and undermining our work .
what work ?
we 're the workers here , not you or them .
you wouldn 't be here without the army !
that 's an entrance !
yes , they know how to fight !
you said it .
you don 't want these horsemen to become our enemies again .
don 't worry , captain .
we know how to defend ourselves .
sure .
like the delormes family .
be careful , boss .
why ?
the marabout said , " the time has come .
" take the frenchman 's land , sheep and wife .
everything ! "
then everyone chanted , " god is great . "
they 've been saying this for 20 years , but we 're still here .
boss !
the workers !
- what about them ?
- they left .
- what do you mean ?
- the workers , sheep ,
- horses and mules , all gone !
- do you know where they went ?
no .
- they 're all gone ?
damn it !
they even took their shoes !
i thought they hurt their feet !
- they can sell them at the souk .
- and the cattle ?
- you think they stole all this ?
the hadjout .
mr. said listened and cheered on the marabout .
- take this and guard the farm .
- where are you going , boss ?
to get a horse - and find them . - be careful , boss .
hadjouts are very mean .
- let me call the army .
- certainly not ! - there 'd be a massacre .
- hadjouts will butcher you .
they know who i am .
thanks for the horse !
what if leila was right ?
i 'm a doctor , not a farmer .
maybe i should give up and leave .
then i realized it 's too late .
we have to stay , change these people , give them laws , civilize them .
i was crazy about algeria .
it 's such a beautiful country .
i come as a friend .
- i 'm not armed !
- where are my workers ?
- they work for us now .
you work your own brothers like slaves ?
punishment for their betrayal .
the hadjouts i met were abdelkader 's best warriors . now they 're just cutthroat murderous cowards !
they violated a saint 's grave ! that 's sacrilege !
they were punished .
it 's god 's law .
- pay !
- i have no money .
heard that ? they want your wife .
we 'll visit your wife . she 'll pay for you .
kill me now .
we 'll show her this and she 'll come get you .
she 'll bring the army .
you 'll all be shot !
aicha ...
i read your articles and pamphlet on algeria .
let me say that i completely disagree with your arabophile views .
you 're entitled to your opinion .
i suppose you 're an arabophobe ?
call it what you will .
as departmental head of the algerian government my views are not theoretical , but based on real things .
i thought we were discussing people - and not things .
- what are your views ?
the cross and the crescent are irreconcilable .
christians and muslims cannot live together unless one dominates the other .
- why should christians dominate ?
- it 's the law of the jungle .
you 're shocked ?
this is how it 's been throughout history .
we 're the masters of algeria .
why can 't the cross and the crescent get along ?
the arabs have refused to cooperate these last 20 years .
they wage wars on us , cut our settlers ' throats , burn our farms , dream of throwing us in the sea .
it 's because we see them as the defeated and not as partners .
what if cossacks or prussians still occupied paris ? if they had burned your family home in normandy , seized your land and destroyed your churches ?
forgive me , general , but i refuse to continue to debate with someone who compares our troops to cossacks !
this is insufferable !
come , darling .
can you believe that fool ?
to think they 're considering him for the secretary general position in algiers .
he treated me like a " moukere . " i put him in his place .
you should have seen the look on his face !
you did well , bahia .
general fleury offered me an assignment in algiers .
my articles and my book are quite popular over there .
- say you 'll take me with you .
- of course i will .
and we 'll visit odilon .
i haven 't heard from him in over a year .
leila wrote me that she 's worried about him .
you smell nice .
do as i say .
- you were with those thieves ?
- when abdelkader surrendered , i took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart .
how is your son ?
- i 'm trying to make him a man .
- may allah watch over him .
abdelkader and i only wished to go to the mecca , but the french didn 't keep their word and kept him prisoner .
so i joined the hadjout . you saw it :
lions became vultures . - murderers .
- it 's not their fault .
the french are stronger .
you fought valiantly .
the time for peace has come .
i 'll speak to governor randon on your behalf .
god willing .
he 's the only one i trust .
it 's up to him .
enough about god !
he helps those who help themselves !
my mind 's made up . i 'm going to algiers .
you 're deserting , hubert .
farming is hard work ,
- but we can 't give up . - my wife was right .
we 're not made to live this way .
you 'll find someone else to lease the farm .
that 's not the problem .
spaniards can work it .
think it over .
need some help ?
boss , i want to go to algiers with you .
i can guard your house , take the children to school , - anything !
- of course .
- your wife will be thrilled .
- you think so ?
she cried a lot when i took her to blida .
you 're part of the family .
you 're like a mother and father to me .
i fell in love with the white city of algiers that embraces the mediterranean shore .
leila had waited for me and forgiven me .
she worked as a nurse , was radiantly happy , had found her place in society .
i finally set up my own practice .
algiers 's european community was expanding by the day .
i had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a french province .
not for military men , but for settlers turning this place into a new country .
odilon !
how are you ?
let me introduce our copy editor , benjamin bensoussan , and jeanne , the " illustration " correspondent .
hello .
excuse me . what do you think of this ?
i went all out .
it 's 4 pages long .
there 's your biography , what happened to you , everything !
you 'll become a hero to the colony !
here 's your tale .
you 're very talented !
i said that before , haven 't i ?
we should team up .
i could sell you half my shares .
- i don 't have any money .
- same here !
buy them on credit .
- let 's shake on it .
- sold . i 'm for the settlers , now i know how they operate .
you finally got it .
it 's all here in my editorial .
" paris 's indifference . " the army 's incompetence and arrogance .
" native laziness . "
read the conclusion ! i showed randon what 's what !
" down with the sword . it 's time for civil power .
" algeria is french ! "
- want to show me around ?
- with pleasure .
children , did you know your father is a hero ?
it 's in all the newspapers .
- don 't exaggerate .
- i heard about it in school .
why are you a hero , father ?
did you kill a lot of arabs ?
- no . why would you think that ?
- when we play cops and robbers , the robbers are always arabs .
ridiculous !
i 'll have a word with your teacher !
they won 't let me be a cop .
- why not ?
- they say i 'm mixed .
what 's that ?
someone who 's half-half .
half french and half arab .
- am i half arab ?
- i don 't wanna be !
you 're not .
you 're a quarter kabyle .
- pass me the jam .
- isn 't that the same ?
not at all !
kabyles are not arabs .
so i can be a cop .
yes .
of course you can play cop , but you can 't kill anyone .
- got it ?
- hurry up , you 'll be late .
- bye .
- have a nice day .
make sure you pay attention .
- bye , sweetie .
- do we understand each other ?
- yes .
- have a nice day .
everyone is talking about you .
i like it here .
i feel like i 'm in france .
- but with arabs .
- we live separately here .
i have to go .
general randon asked me to come see him .
see you tonight .
so , hubert , you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you 're a retired officer , aren 't you ?
- i am , general .
- and you write for this rag , run by roucaries .
a commie !
we should have sent him to new caledonia .
- he 's a republican , general .
- a commie ! an anarchist !
he defends mercenaries , adventurers and deportees who come to algeria to exploit native labor !
let me remind you , general , that the settlers are colonizing and farming this land - on behalf of france .
- land that the army conquered !
we 'll discuss this some other time .
i asked you here because you 're familiar with the mitidja .
i 'm worried . new incidents have been reported .
marabout sidi yacoub travels the area and gets them all worked up .
it 's an epidemic !
reports of so-called marabouts all over the country , calling for " jihad . "
- they have monkeys and goats . - it 's an old tradition .
they capture the imagination of the naive and ignorant who fall for their cheap tricks .
- they 're illusionists .
- exactly .
- ever heard of robert houdin ?
your marabouts couldn 't hold a candle to him .
- i asked paris to send him here .
- i fail to see the connection .
arabs are a superstitious people .
they 're amazed by sleight of hand .
i 'll show them a better magician than all their marabouts .
robert houdin !
general bugeaud once tried to send them false prophets .
they were all murdered .
this is different !
this one 's french !
i 'd bet you anything that he 'll amaze them !
he amazed me , so ...
the arabs want to see wonders , so i 'll show them wonders !
one last thing , i 'm told you 're friends with an author called toussaint , a man turning paris upside down , demanding that arabs
- be considered our equals ?
- i am . he 's here , on a mission for general fleury .
i had to give him an office .
i 'm not sure what he 's up to , but i don 't like it , so i 'm having him followed .
try to get some information out of him and keep me apprized .
want some wine , boss ?
ahmed , i told you to call him " sir . "
sorry .
want some wine , sire ?
- sir .
- no , i 'm fine , yaouled .
and stop calling him yaouled .
his name 's ahmed .
didn 't i tell you ?
i decided we should frenchify our lifestyle .
i ordered restoration armchairs .
i like the sitting room the way it is .
that stuck-up woman at the general 's asked if i was a moor !
that 's why . that 's not an insult .
you 're half spanish , a quarter kabyle and a quarter french .
and the end result is not bad at all .
i 'm french !
i don 't want people thinking i 'm a " moukere ! "
did you know the toussaints were here ?
the moved into one of the best palaces in algiers .
i know . he 's important now .
he 's general fleury 's agent and speaks for parisian arabophiles .
i saw bahia this afternoon .
she 's putting on airs now that she 's lived in paris .
- sauce ?
- please .
she invited us to dinner tomorrow night .
i 'm looking forward to seeing helie .
- isn 't this a bit cold ?
- no .
sorry , but it is .
yaouled ?
ahmed .
ahmed !
could we have forks ?
i don 't eat with my hands anymore .
so ?
i don 't understand why you stopped writing me .
you let me down .
you 'd promised to ask your friends to help me .
- i 'm still waiting .
- sorry , it wasn 't easy with all these changes of regime : first a kingdom , then a republic , and now an empire .
- you don 't know how it is .
- i do .
judging by your stripes , you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
what happened to you ?
you 've changed .
while you were having fun in paris , - i went through hell here !
- why did you become a settler ?
that 's enough .
i 've heard enough .
go see how they live on the mitidja !
i now understand what " bad settlers " are .
excuse me .
- how are your children ?
- well .
and yours ?
well .
i 'd like them to live here .
why ?
they 're lucky enough to study in france .
excuse me .
i 'd like them to know their homeland and to speak arabic .
what for ?
what 's important is that they speak french .
it 's their culture , their roots .
i don 't want them to deny their origins , like others do .
is this why you still wear a " jellaba " ?
i 'm proud to wear it .
and it will never go out of style .
it 's their damn religion that puts them to sleep .
medieval fatalism .
what are you doing to help them ?
touring robert houdin disguised as a marabout ?
you want them to stay ignorant so you can dominate them .
we have to defend ourselves .
your desertion policy would have us all leave within 5 years .
did you forget our dream of uniting the east and the west ?
only equality and progress can give arabs their dignity back .
they don 't want your progress .
ask our saint-simonian brothers . ask talabot .
they 're sabotaging his railroad .
to modernize the country , we need to impose our laws and our better institutions . it 's not only in our interest ,
- but in theirs .
- am i really hearing this ?
you sound like those colonialists i keep meeting here in algiers !
i found more support for algerians in paris !
it 's easy to be pro-arab when you live in paris .
no one is on your side here , not governor , army or settlers .
you 've already lost the battle .
i 'll be frank .
your newspaper is jeopardizing our collaboration with arabs .
this might result in a war .
there 's nothing left to be said .
let 's go .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how sad .
they 're hopeless .
misfortune has made them bitter .
i , hadj hamou , give you my horse as well as this sword with which i 've always fought fairly .
my life is in your hands .
you can have my son as a symbol of my sincerity .
may god help you decide our fate .
as a show of faith , i 'll let you keep your sword and horse , but i 'll take care of your son .
he can serve france when he 's older .
go back to your people and live peacefully .
drum roll !
i 'll only use it to defend my new friends if they 're attacked .
i 'll see to it that he goes to a good school , so he can follow in his father 's footsteps .
france 's flag is wide and can shelter all those who seek refuge and protection .
i spent 20 years of my life fighting , killing and destroying .
i will now devote myself to peace and rebuilding .
i could take care of him and his studies .
under one condition .
which is ?
that you let him be muslim .
i swear to your god and mine to do so .
i 'll care for him as if he were my own .
how long will that boy stay in our home ?
i don 't know .
it 'll depend on his studies .
he eats with his hands . he doesn 't know how to use a fork .
he 'll learn .
this is what we 're here for .
you treat that child better than your own .
- good night , father .
good night , mother .
- good night , mother .
- good night , sidi baba .
- good night .
you 're not his father .
he 's only repeating what he 's heard .
you 've got a new nightgown .
where did you get it ?
i got some proper clothes .
why do you always hide that you 're kind-hearted ?
- i want to see father . - go on .
- stop touching my things !
don 't mind him . he 's just mean .
you can play with me .
a pearl .
- a chair .
- a table .
- a girl .
- a pearl .
not a pearl .
a girl .
" a girl . "
a boy .
" a boy . " a girl . a boy .
go to bed .
but say your prayers first .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee , blessed art thou amongst women ...
i was a medical officer , he , an interpreter .
it was a mythical algeria .
wanting arabs to abide by french rules would be a mistake .
they 're our partners , ...
the doc is a spy .
watch his every move .
- bring me all his letters .
- i 'm in love .
she 's here to spy on you .
that 's what the arabs do !
this is a war of conquest and extermination of arabs .
some parisian newspapers even wrote that we 're the barbarians .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republican and pro-arab .
after having conquered this land in the name of france , you will now farm it . and make it your new home !
can 't the cross and the crescent get along ?
they have different customs and values .
they 're savages !
you 'll all be shot !
you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you write for this rag ?
you sound like those colonialists i keep meeting here in algiers !
it 's easy to be pro-arab when you live in paris .
i never betrayed you .
no one must ever know .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
i couldn 't show my happiness .
i hope we won 't regret raising this child as ours .
why would we ?
my son aissa looked so much like naouel , whom i had loved so much .
what was in store for him ?
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 3 .
the arab kingdom
you 're so handsome and strong , my son .
you 're the one who 's beautiful , mom .
- you are .
- no .
i 'm old now .
your father doesn 't look at me anymore .
- he took a new wife . very young .
- another one ?
since you joined the french , he took 2 wives to sire children .
i 'm not a good mare .
i only had one son .
you .
i think polygamy is barbaric .
you sound like a frenchman .
it 's the " kaida . " the prophet had 9 wives .
- what 's the new wife 's name ?
- she 's from a noble clan .
she is jealous of me .
wanted me sent to the kitchen .
no way !
you 're coming to algiers , to stay with me .
no !
be reassured , son .
your father respects and protects me .
besides , i don 't want to be a burden on you .
it 's time for you to get married .
i chose a nice girl for you from a good family . very pretty and sweet .
sixteen . nice hips , not like me .
she 'll give you beautiful kids .
- no .
- you don 't want to get married ?
your brothers are already engaged , but your father won 't let them marry because you 're the eldest .
i want to choose my own wife .
you love someone else .
yes .
a french woman ?
yes .
- who is she ?
- i can 't tell you .
not even to your mother ?
i don 't know if her parents will allow it .
- it 's because you 're an arab .
- no .
it 's more complicated .
no , it isn 't .
be careful aissa .
the french are hypocrites .
they 're against polygamy , but they all have mistresses .
they won 't give you their daughter .
love can break all barriers .
you 're young .
time erases all ... even love .
your old mother ... knows .
abdallah seems to be managing well .
i 'm not used to it anymore .
you can study here .
i slowly built up a nice library .
i even found manuscripts that belonged to emir abdelkader .
may god protect him in exile .
france stole you from us , aissa .
you forgot that you gave me to france .
it made me into an officer .
it 's like a mother to me .
there are 2 france , aissa .
that 's what i learned .
in paris , france made you an officer and freed italy . here , france keeps algeria under its yoke .
the governor is seizing our land to give to the colonists .
what do they want ?
herd us in the sahara ?
i 'm certain napoleon iii is against confinement .
five tribal elders and i are to meet him in compiegne .
we 'll see if he 's on our side .
- we must trust him .
- may god hear you ... and inspire him truth and justice .
aissa was back .
what joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence , now a grown man covered in glory under the french banner .
- at magenta and solferino ?
- yes .
- you lucky devil . - emile .
war is no joke , except for kings and emperors . victory in solferino cost thousands of lives .
yes , but we saved the italians from austrian occupation .
what a beautiful uniform .
you look handsome .
- dinner is ready .
- let 's go .
tell us all about it .
to aissa .
i looked at aissa .
he was proof that one could be a good frenchman and a good a muslim .
did he embody the successful union of the east and the west ?
i started to believe in it again .
i don 't like the way aissa looks at jeanne .
- going out ?
with those goo goo eyes of his .
- didn 't you notice ?
- no . why ?
- suppose he 's in love with her .
- what are you talking about ?
i hope we won 't regret raising this child as ours .
on the contrary .
he 's the perfect example of integration .
- he 's like a frenchman .
- perhaps . but he isn 't .
he is by the blood he spilled , fighting for france .
that 's fine , but i don 't want him to touch my daughter .
don 't worry .
he 's staying in town and wants to be his own man .
i hope so .
i have something to tell you , jeanne .
i love war .
i discovered a new homeland :
in the army , barriers fall .
i 'm not a muslim among catholics or an arab among french .
i 'm a soldier among soldiers . all equal before death .
only one rule : courage .
- do you understand ?
- i don 't know . it 's a male world where women have no place .
i 'm bored , aissa .
i need to do something useful , exciting , unique .
sometimes i envy the fate of colonist women .
it 's dangerous but so exciting .
jeanne . will you marry me ?
of course .
when we were little , we said we 'd get married .
will your parents let their daughter marry a muslim ?
i don 't know about dad .
mother won 't .
but i don 't care .
- where is miss jeanne ?
- outside .
how are you feeling ?
well .
why ?
you 've been odd , lately .
you can trust me .
among women , we can understand each other .
nothing is troubling me .
a mother feels such things .
you 're a big girl , jeanne .
it 's time to think about your future .
there 're many young officers from good families in algiers .
i 'll invite some for you to meet .
- i 'm not in a hurry to marry .
- then you 'll be an old maid .
mother !
what are you driving at ?
i don 't want you to fall for just anyone .
that 's all .
- that 's what it is . - yes .
that 's what it is .
you 've changed since aissa 's return .
- you have a soft spot for him .
- not a soft spot .
we 're in love .
we want to get married .
what ?
marry an arab ?
a muslim ?
no way !
marriage is something serious .
you marry someone with the same religion and background .
i forbid you to see this boy .
understood ?
i forbid you .
understood ?
yes .
- i knew it .
i told you . - thank you .
and you thought they were like brother and sister .
i 'll call the police if he sets foot in here again .
what 's gotten into you ?
we raised him as one or ours .
unfortunately , yes .
anyway you always had a soft spot for him .
- i don 't want him to touch her .
he won 't have the chance anyway .
his regiment is leaving for france , then mexico .
- when ?
- i don 't know .
the emperor wants maximilian of austria in mexico .
very good .
how can you say that .
it 's war over there .
just as well .
maybe he 'll get killed .
is jeanne there ?
get out !
beat it !
never set foot in this house !
go away !
- you had no right to stop him .
- you do what you 're told .
you can 't stop me .
i 'll leave , come what may .
i 'll join him , become a muslim if need be .
- go to your room !
- don 't touch me !
don 't you ever , again .
- what are you doing here ?
- i escaped from home .
- are you out of your mind ?
- i came to say goodbye .
- what are you doing ?
- i want to be yours .
i can 't believe it !
look at this !
see the news ?
your circumcised pal is taking 5 elders to see the emperor .
- did you know ?
- no .
- we 're not close anymore .
- they are plotting in compiegne , with general fleury and the saint-simonians .
- what do they want ?
- arabize us .
said , come with me .
take care of yourself !
don 't worry .
this trip is very important for me .
the emperor has decided .
he read my books .
he plans a new algeria policy , my policy .
can you understand that ?
- you 'll see the kids at least . - of course .
i 'll write every day and tell you what 's happening .
" dear bahia , you can 't imagine how lavishly
" the emperor received our arab friends at compiegne . "
" everything is so wonderful .
" the emperor held long talks with the elders .
" he promised complete equality between europeans and arabs .
" ' that 's but fair , honorable and right , ' he told them . " who were delighted , you can imagine .
" it 's truly a revolution . "
" the native chiefs gave the emperor a black stallion , " a magnificent offspring of the famous godolphin arabian , " father of all thoroughbreds .
" his majesty has a special place for it .
" ' we 'll be able to compete with the british , ' gen. fleury said .
" her majesty the empress and the imperial prince " showed our friends consideration and appreciation .
" the emperor recognized aissa , whom he decorated at magenta . " he also introduced him to the empress .
" his father , hadj hamou , was filled with pride .
" finally , his majesty did me the honor
" to explain in detail his project to our friends " to turn algeria into an arab kingdom . "
dear friends , here 's the man whose works have inspired the emperor 's policy .
no one can better explain it to you .
i 'll give him the floor .
the emperor asked me to tell you that we didn 't come to algeria to oppress or plunder , but to bring you the blessings of civilization .
he wants to make algeria an arab kingdom .
henceforth , he 'll protect you , as he does the french .
he is both emperor of the french and king of the arabs .
- in practice , what does it mean ?
- firstly ... the emperor will end the confinement policy .
your title to traditional tribal lands will be recognized .
no more despoliation .
- will land be ours ?
- it will belong to the tribes .
later , everyone will have a share .
secondly ... following the proclamation of full european-arab equality , the emperor shall grant french citizenship to jews and arabs who so desire .
we know france brings progress and we are grateful .
but we 'd rather live according to our own laws and customs .
for us muslims , religion rules everything .
you know that .
the koran is our civil code , our book of science and medicine , the word of god .
i assure you , all your views will be taken into account .
let us begin .
what 's your impression ?
they are delighted by their stay .
they were also charmed by his majesty .
i think they 'll agree with the arab kingdom model , except for si kadour , my father-in-law .
we have to handle him carefully .
he 's very influential in kabylia .
in any event , it 's imperative for his majesty to come to algeria to launch his policy .
it will provoke colonist and military opposition .
he 'll come .
it 's only a question of timing .
if pelissier doesn 't like it , we 'll replace him .
there you are .
talabot has been waiting for you for half an hour .
- paulin , i 'm happy to see you .
- odilon .
- what are you doing in algiers ?
- big news , old pal .
next week , we 'll be laying down the last railroad track . we 're also inaugurating the new blida station .
marshal pelissier ...
everyone will be there .
i hope you 'll write a nice article .
is the paper yours ?
i bought 50 % from roucaries , but it 's not doing well .
no .
i have to meet pelissier .
i gave roucaries all the details .
- see you later at the cafe .
- agreed .
is mr. talabot a saint-simonian ?
i heard you were too .
does this sect still exist ?
they 're scattered , but still have influence at the court , among university students and bankers .
here 's the article . lately , they 've become like the freemasons .
what do they want ?
the utopians like toussaint believe in santa claus .
the others believe in progress , thinking that with money , factories , mines and railroads , they can solve everything .
the paradox is that they began as socialists , and now they 're big capitalists .
i saw helie yesterday .
we spoke about you and old times .
it seems you had a falling out ?
we have nothing to say to each other .
he 's gen. fleury 's man . he heads the pro-arab camp that wants to sell out algeria .
we disagree about the future of this country .
you 're both wrong .
helie thinks that the french and arabs can live as equals .
you want to turn them into frenchmen .
that 's an illusion .
and you ?
what 's your solution ? i ... build .
i build railroads and roads , dig the ground , plant trees .
i represent progress , a sort of charity .
i deal with reality , not dreams .
do you know what arabs say about your railroad ?
" al-rabat sheitan , " the devil 's cart .
i 'm hungry .
let 's have lunch .
good piece , benjamin !
you 'll do the next on the army 's anti-confinement action .
- look !
nice layout .
- yes .
boy , come here .
it 's time i tell him .
i have bad news .
- i can guess .
- i can 't pay you .
you haven 't paid him in 2 months .
it 's not my fault if we don 't have money .
half the colonists are spanish and can 't read french .
- i got an idea .
- really ?
struck gold ?
- maybe .
- serious ?
- where ?
- here in algiers . - what is it ?
- my dad 's pockets .
we 're always ready to help our french friends .
from the start of conquest we offered france our services .
we know the turks and arabs well , mr. hubert .
we 've dealt with them for 2 centuries , since my ancestors came from leghorn to trade between barbary coast pirates and italian merchants .
please , sit down .
we know your father advises gen. bugeaud on arab affairs .
benjamin told me about your paper 's financial difficulties .
that shouldn 't be a problem . my eldest son david , who runs our bank , can help you .
did you hear me ?
with a special rate for friends .
thank you very much . let me also say how much we appreciate benjamin 's intelligence , skills and talents .
yes , benjamin .
i sent him to law school in montpellier . it cost a bundle , but we wanted him to be our lawyer .
but in france , he caught the political bug .
politics seals the fate of nations .
it 's very important .
trade is safer .
business is business , whoever is in power .
since your paper deals with politics , i 've a favor to ask .
please , tell me .
as head of the jewish council , i 'm host to a french member of parliament who is concerned about our small community . his name is adolphe cremieux .
i hope he gets french citizenship for algerian jews .
i thought you weren 't interested in politics .
it 's , let 's say , about religion .
we 'll be glad to interview him .
tell him to come to the paper .
thank you .
actually , thank you for what you 're doing for the paper .
it 's for a good cause , that of a french algeria where jews will play an important role .
since that is the case , could you arrange a meeting between myself as head of the jewish council , and the governor-general ?
the army and i aren 't ...
you can see to it with my son daniel .
perhaps .
- see you tomorrow ... 8 am ?
- yes .
bahia ?
- had a good trip ?
- a bit long .
- i missed you .
- you too . - come !
- you 're still as beautiful .
tell me about the kids .
they 're well .
they send their love and miss you .
ahmed got his ph.d. in law with honors .
good !
now he can practice in algiers .
- i 'm not sure he wants to .
- you 'll get upset .
- tell me !
he thinks he won 't make it in algiers .
he 's decided to stay in paris and changed his name .
- he now calls himself amedee .
- my son ahmed ?
don 't be upset !
i don 't like it , but i can understand him .
in paris , an arab name sticks out like a turban .
many jews and poles took french names .
he won 't be the first .
then , why aren 't french taking arab names here ?
it 's a religious thing .
the french take saints ' names .
- i won 't have it .
- bahia !
i 'll write him what i think .
calm down .
things will change .
ahmed might too .
the emperor accepted our proposals .
algeria will be an arab kingdom with equal citizens .
it will be a tough sell .
everyone is against you .
- you must be hungry .
- a bit .
marshal pelissier will see you .
- some port as you wait ?
- no , thanks .
i don 't drink .
a cigar ?
i don 't smoke .
besides , it 's ramadan .
sorry !
i forgot .
the governor is in a foul mood .
he got orders from paris , he doesn 't like .
i think i know what they are .
so you 're here .
did you put all this nonsense in his majesty 's head ?
my respects , marshal .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
don 't be so coy !
this letter of instructions from his majesty ,
which he personally signed .
it talks about the end of the confinement policy , about the arab kingdom ,
and arab-european equality .
did you put him up to it ?
it 's full of your books ' subversive language ... and that of your friends , fleury , david ...
you flatter me thinking i have such influence on his majesty .
no doubletalk .
hear this , little fellow !
i was on the beach when we landed .
i didn 't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the arabs who 'll mess it up .
i won 't ever accept that !
do you hear me ?
ever !
may i remind you , sir . the country belongs to the arabs .
no more .
we took it with our blood .
and especially with theirs .
listen , toussaint !
we aren 't dreamers , visionaries .
we build .
we 're turning algeria into a modern country bringing comfort to the colonists and progress to the natives .
there is no other viable plan .
all else is idle talk for frustrated intellectuals a bit like you .
you won 't build anything without the algerians .
toussaint ...
you might be the smartest , but i warn you ... i shall stop you .
god be my witness ! i 'm the strongest .
i too have connections in the court .
perhaps you forget that my wife is the empress ' cousin .
- may i go , marshal ?
- get out !
and don 't get in my way or you 'll regret it .
my respects , marshal .
what arrogance !
i asked the emperor to remove this good-for-nothing .
he 's general fleury 's man and he 's backed by the emperor .
by jove , we 'll see who 's the strongest .
keep your smooth talk for paris .
when we came here , there was nothing but desert , swamps , flies and dwarf palms .
one third of us died of cholera .
one third gave up and rented the land to the arabs .
we are the last third .
we survived massacres , disease , drought , grasshoppers .
we won 't give in to your arab kingdom .
listen ! why end confinement ?
algeria has 3.5 million people . it can feed 20 .
we have 12 million hectares of uncultivated land . and you want to stop colonization .
thousands of colonists can come .
why leave good land to the arabs ?
either their herds destroy it , or they badly farm it .
- we produce 6 times they do .
- he 's right .
it 's our land .
we created a new france here .
friends , the land belongs to the natives , the colonists and the army .
the emperor declared it an arab kingdom , a european colony and a military camp .
arrant nonsense .
it 's crystal clear to me .
first , we 're not your friends , toussaint . ruling means choosing .
it 's either us or them .
tell your emperor that no one will throw us out .
this is our home .
our enemies want to give power to the arabs .
if they win , that 'll toll the bell for us .
- do you want to become arab ?
we 'll remain french . we won 't bow to napoleon the puny ... king of the arabs !
we are now 200,000 europeans .
we can 't be dismissed .
we 've rallied the colonists , and all true republicans :
printers , masons , merchants , and architects .
- are the jews with us ?
- of course . they might not dare come out , but i 'm here .
we 'll mobilize the women and demonstrate with you .
down with the emperor !
long live the republic !
we had a feverish month .
algiers was under siege . every day , people heard our call . women too .
- french algeria !
french algeria ! - present arms !
get ready !
let us through .
we 're going to the government house .
- the street is closed .
- let us through !
aim !
- forward !
- french algeria !
take it easy !
i 'm not unhappy about the protests .
they show paris the futility of its abandonment policy .
even women are getting into the act .
that 's too much .
these people are hotheads a bit quick-tempered , but they cool down as quickly .
don 't forget !
we 're south of marseille .
anyway , make sure the troops aren 't trigger-happy .
break some skulls if you must , but no fire .
that 's an order .
i don 't want any violence .
understood ?
no more violence .
it cooled down after a month .
mar. pelissier died from pneumonia . the arab kingdom policy had its first setback .
neither jews nor arabs wanted to give up their special status in exchange for french citizenship .
only 200 arabs out of 3 million applied for it . aissa was one of them and had his own reasons .
- thanks but i don 't drink .
- of course .
i came to ask you for jeanne 's hand , officially .
my regiment leaves for mexico and we would like to be engaged before i leave .
aissa . you and jeanne cannot marry .
why ?
you 're too young , practically brother and sister .
a kabyle proverb says , " marry within your tribe ,
" within your village , and if possible , within your family . "
you belong to different worlds .
what ?
i 'm french now .
yes , but you 're also muslim .
do you know the obstacles you 'll be facing ?
jeanne will want a church wedding .
what will your family say ?
- there 're other mixed couples .
- they 're the exception .
your friend helie toussaint married a muslim woman .
yes , but he converted , and now stands disowned by his family .
listen !
let 's not beat around the bush . is it yes or no ?
aissa . i 'd like to say yes but it 's impossible .
believe me .
trust me .
it 's no , then .
what if we eloped without your permission ?
i forbid you .
i get it .
my arab blood was acceptable on the battlefield .
in paris , they saw fit to grant me french citizenship .
but they forgot to tell me it was a second class passport , because here in algiers , i 'm always an outsider , a native .
even for you .
it 's all clear now .
i 'll wait for you .
when you return , i 'll be of age .
i 'll leave home .
we 'll marry and live in france .
we still have to wait .
i 'll wait for as long as it takes .
napoleon iii came to algeria twice to proclaim himself king of the arabs .
he was delighted .
he ate ostrich eggs , roasted gazelle and lion meat .
everywhere , huge arab crowds cheered him .
our paper had to concede his great success , organized , it must be said , by the arab office .
helie acted as his interpreter throughout his stay .
it was his hour of glory .
he thought he 'd seen the dawn of the arab kingdom . history decided otherwise .
look at this !
four years of drought , famine , cholera , and grasshoppers .
all at once in just 4 years .
look !
they 're eating grass , roots and even leaves .
people are dropping like flies from hunger and cholera .
where are the french doctors ?
cholera isn 't racist . frenchmen have died from it too .
even bugeaud died from it in paris .
did you see how the peasant treated me ?
when you privatized collective land , you broke up the tribe ,
it 's the price of progress and of a fairer , modern society .
do you know what they did with the arid land you gave them ?
they sold it to the colonists for a pittance .
people here are superstitious .
they 're saying the arab kingdom has the evil eye .
i 'm sorry , but all you 've done for us is turning against us .
all the same , you can 't blame us for drought , grasshoppers , and disease .
bad luck hounds us .
people say it 's god 's vengeance because we didn 't defend our land against the infidels .
tell the governor that if france does nothing , there 'll be war .
- warn him .
- i will .
tell him that i lost a son ... to cholera , and that my youngest might go into the mountains .
- you know what that means ?
- how is she ?
- it 's cholera .
quick . she 's being waiting for you for 2 days .
my son ... apple of my eye .
- you came to say farewell .
- i 'm here .
you 'll pull through .
it 's too late .
god picks the hour and mine has come .
i 've a secret to tell you .
a secret ?
yes , aissa . one that i 've carried in my heart since you were born .
odilon is your father .
you mustn 't marry jeanne .
forgive me , aissa !
i mixed infidel blood ... with that of the true warriors of the faith .
i was young , a harem slave .
during the tafna peace ,
odilon was abdelkader 's doctor .
you were born after that .
hadj hamou raised you . he taught you to walk , to ride a horse , and to use a sword and rifle .
he taught you right from wrong , and courage .
he taught you the true religion .
he 's your father too .
stay with me !
stay !
i had made a promise .
i will always be fond of jeanne .
promise me never to tell her .
i promise .
if it does , i 'll fight by your side .
you can 't , aissa .
that 'd give you away .
have you forsaken your religion ?
i haven 't .
one day , france will allow its citizens to be catholic , jewish or muslim .
france ... maybe .
but we won 't here , son , not on muslim soil .
you 're french now .
you must leave and fulfill your destiny .
i am french .
but my heart will forever be in algeria .
you 're hiding something .
what 's going on ?
is it another woman ?
is that it ?
be honest .
i 'm getting married .
what ?
my mother has chosen my future wife .
i cannot refuse .
it 's tradition , you see .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't care .
what 'll you do , all alone in paris ?
where will you stay ?
with aunt ines .
i 'll take a job as a nurse .
i 'll treat the wounded on the front .
i 'll defend france .
you 're lying .
you want to go with him .
you want to be with your arab !
throwing yourself at him like that !
how dare you ?
look at yourself .
a kabyle raped your grandmother !
you 're an arab too !
the bad arabs like raping women like you !
jeanne ...
our armies are getting defeated everywhere :
wissembourg , reichshoffen-froeschwiller ...
what a disgrace !
what possessed the emperor to wage war on prussia ?
bismarck was waiting for it .
new headline !
the emperor was captured and abdicated .
gambetta declared a new republic .
a new republic , my friends !
follow me !
said ? i couldn 't believe it .
the emperor had been captured .
they 'd declared a new republic .
my old dream had finally come true !
i 'm the lieutenant commander !
you should leave before my friends get here .
listen to them . they 're jubilant .
don 't be a hero , it 's best you flee .
where 's toussaint ?
where 's that sly fox ?
vanished .
we 'll get him sooner or later .
while the french are fighting each other ,
- let 's throw them into the sea .
we must save the arab kingdom .
they say they 're republicans , but you know them .
they 're colonialists , arabophobes ...
let 's rouse the tribes and drive the french out !
- cowards !
- listen to me !
we 've talked enough .
i 'll rouse my troops and fight !
come with me to oran , bahia .
you can 't stay in algiers .
bahia ...
i beg you ...
do this for me .
are you the little scamp my daughter went crazy over ?
anyway , he 's a good boy .
and very polite if you can believe it .
we 'll see .
he 's one of the best blacksmiths in the country .
okay , grandpa .
ah .
there you are .
- this one ?
- yes , it will stir the fire .
in 2 months , you 'll have man 's muscles !
you can stop now , olivier .
you should tour the stable and say hi to the cows .
you 'll find 3 . they 're kind .
there 's dourade , the most assured .
then , la marcade , and finally , poumerade , the one with the spots . - where is the stable ?
- in the back .
you can go .
hello cows !
how are you ?
and you , la marcade . and you are la dourade .
how are you , poumerade ?
let me introduce myself .
normally i live in montmartre .
what are you doing here ?
get out of here , you hear me ?
he knows what to expect , now . if that bandit ever comes near the farm again .
what is the sense of adding misery to misery ?
come on , now . he provoked me , right ? i didn 't start anything .
- we must understand him . - understand him !
if you can understand a criminal , you can understand me as well .
if he ever comes close to the lad he knows what to expect .
i thought your god was the god of forgiveness .
leave my god alone ! i 'm taking the animals to the fields .
make sure the boy doesn 't leave the farm unaccompanied .
why not ? he 's not in prison , here .
you read what victoria wrote in her letter :
you must never leave that little scoundrel out of your sight !
you 'd think victoria makes the rules in my home !
could you please call " pitchou " ?
olivier ! go see your grandfather .
right , read me that article .
" the nazi party stated that the germans have rallied in great numbers ...
" by adolf hitler to burn all books deemed subversive ...
" and decadent in the public square .
" several million books were reduced to ashes on the morning of may 5 . "
you see , olivier , when the world 's train leaves its tracks , no one knows where it will stop .
why would anyone want to burn books ?
they bring no harm . they don 't want people to think ! they 're being groomed to be like machines .
but tell me , you read very well , how can you be doing so poorly in class , at least according to your aunt victoria ?
- i don 't know , grandpa . - you don 't know ...
furthermore , it seems you sneak out of the college at night . you 're a real escoulas !
in our family we always had rebels .
look at me : i 'm the only red in this country of whites !
say , grandpa ?
yes ?
the sanatorium where marceau is staying , it 's in this region , right ?
i say , you go straight to the point .
you 've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanatorium .
tell me , did you come here to see marceau ?
- yes , grandpa . - it 's good to tell the truth . but ...
victoria was very clear that under no circumstance ... you were to go to the sanatorium .
but why would she object ?
she must have her reasons . you see , we 're alike .
you think so ?
and why is that ?
because i want to see marceau too ! i really miss my grandson .
he grew up here .
always running after girls in the hills , and fishing for trout or crayfish .
we had some great times , him and me .
but now , it only hurts to know he 's there .
the doctor told me i couldn 't go , that i could catch his illness .
but mark my words :
we 're going to see him together ! - really ? - as real as i am an escoulas .
i looked at the map , it 's about 50 km .
we 're not going to take the road .
the mountain trails will save us at least 10 km .
we 'll take a horse and buggy , and i 'll tell them i 'm taking you to the animal fair in langeac .
will they let us go ?
they 'll say i 'm crazy . but i 'm head of this family . - i can do what i want , right ?
- yes , grandpa ! hold on .
don 't get your spirits too high .
i need to know if you can keep a secret .
with victor and grannie , you have to act a bit , show them you 're not really thrilled about coming with me .
- right . - good .
we shouldn 't arouse their suspicions .
we 'll leave sunday at dawn .
but until then ...
that means we won 't arrive before nightfall . they 'll figure out we didn 't go to langeac .
so what ?
once i 've seen marceau , they can think what they want .
i don 't care .
at least we 're lucky , the weather 's on our side .
hopefully we won 't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass .
let 's go , nono . let 's go !
that 's it , grandpa !
- i gave him some oats . - that 's good .
- here .
let 's have a little feast !
some ham , bread and wine .
that 's my holy trinity .
you see , whatever victoria might think ,
i wouldn 't trade a single tree from these mountains ... for all the lights in paris .
say , grandpa ? why doesn 't grannie like being kissed ? you must understand her .
she lost 2 children .
that made her a little colder .
if you had known her when she was in her 20s , she was beautiful . a real eye-popper .
you know , for our marriage , we undertook the white stick ceremony .
the white stick ceremony ?
what 's that ? if the fiancee placed a broom on its flip-side against her door , it meant she didn 't want you .
- that is so funny .
- you think so ? damn it ! i didn 't sleep all night .
but the next morning , grannie had turned all the brooms on the farm on the right side .
and even the filthy ones .
if only she could hear me !
at the time , she just loved clinging to my arm as we danced .
what are you wishing for , young mountaineer ? what did you hope to acquire if you are unwilling to dance ?
que volio cerca , jovo de la montagna ?
que volio cerca , si volio pas danser ? if you didn 't want to dance , you should not have come .
aie ! grandpa !
- i tripped , olivier .
- come , come . come , it 's nothing .
it 's nothing .
just give me a hand .
serves me right for playing the young man .
there .
i 'm breathing better and i 'll be alright .
we still have ... 2 km uphill .
the road will be easier after that .
and what if it 's m 'sieur privat ?
we 'll say hi anyway .
- but he tried to kill my parents !
- so what ? you don 't fire a gun at people without a reason .
have you ever asked yourself why he did that ?
grandpa ! it 's uncle victor .
that 's a different matter .
- you think i don 't see through this ?
you 'll never get to the sanatorium before nightfall .
it 's madness . what do you mean ?
is it madness to want to see my grandson ?
- you 're the one that 's crazy !
- i might be crazy ... but you 're turning around and i come with you .
and you , olivier , don 't try that again or i 'll bust your ass .
and not a word to your grandma , she 'll gouge your eyes out .
i bought a 6 lb ham at fayet 's .
let 's go .
you see , the word solitude , it only takes one " l " .
because it 's all alone , you see !
you didn 't conjugate correctly the past tense of the verb " shoot . "
tell me why ! because it 's an exception . it 's an irregular verb .
then why couldn 't you get that right ? i forgot .
on top of that you misspelled the proper name of the bandit .
if you work hard , you 'll soon become an ace .
but ... when you go back to school , you 'll have to go back to paris .
- but , grandpa ... - it 's sad to say , but nowadays , the future of youth lies within the cities .
it breaks my heart to say it because , as you know , i would love it if you could stay here with me .
i would love to stay here with you too . don 't be silly !
after a few months , you 'd get bored .
no . i 'm happy , here .
i 'm happy like ... - like ...
- like with your mother ?
so much the better .
you should join your grannie out in the fields .
today , she 's at devil 's abyss .
you know where that is ?
what will grannie say ? you 'll soon find out .
don 't forget to greet the folks you encounter .
here people talk to each other .
" parlez-moi d 'amour
" redites-moi des choses tendres
" votre beau discours ... " mon coeur n 'est pas las de l 'entendre
besides , you wanted to kill my parents !
you said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you !
but you fired a gun at them .
that 's why you went to jail !
it 's your aunt who told you that ?
let me tell you what happened .
i don 't want to hear it .
leave me alone !
what are you up to , olivier ?
you came directly ?
no , i swear it , grannie .
- did you meet anyone on the way ? - no .
actually , yes . i saw louison flandin .
he asked me to go to a soccer game with him .
- i told him i was coming to see you .
- very well , then .
good . well , i 'm off to see the cows .
what are you doing ?
you can tell you 're from paris !
cows don 't care for sugar . they like salt !
give the sugar to the dog .
it 's not good for his eyes , but over here , we don 't let anything go to waste .
here , doggy , come boy .
good , huh ? that 's good .
how can you tell when it 's time to go back to the farm , then ?
look at the shadow cast by the shed .
when it reaches the boulder , it 's time to bring the cows home .
looks like you have a heat stroke . go freshen up at the river .
- the river looks pretty deep .
- " devil 's abyss " ?
- a long time ago , there was a man who bragged about not believing in either god or devil .
well , the poor bastard got his punishment .
the river swallowed him .
- really ? - obviously ! he made a point to come and work here on the lord 's day .
one stormy day , as he was driving his cart along the banks , he surely came too close to the precipice .
then the two hands of the devil lunged from the river , his long claws grasped him fiercely so he couldn 't move , and down he went to the bottom with his two horses !
- that 's not true . it 's a legend . - you 're like your grandfather .
climb up on the rock ... and bend over the precipice .
you 'll see the remains of the cart at the bottom !
- see it ?
- not sure .
the water isn 't clear .
look again !
ah yes ! i see it .
i see the cart with bones and a skeleton !
did you notice , grannie ?
the shadow has set on the boulder .
well done , you 're a fast learner .
soon , you 'll be able to lead the cows to the pasture all by yourself .
if you like . here .
take my stick and lead them toward the trail .
go on ! we 'll see how well you do .
come on cows ! let 's go .
where are you going , poumerade ?
it 's pretty obvious you pealed chunks off her hoof .
i 'm not selling her to you . ( speaking patois )
patois with a parisian accent . very comical .
he 's making progress in this area too !
- olivier ! it 's great that you can now smith , but you can 't neglect your studies .
wait !
we 're not done yet .
an automobile !
she did well for herself , our victoria .
that 's for sure .
she went to paris and paris went to her head .
she 's ashamed of us .
she avoids telling her friends that we are blacksmiths . instead , she says we 're ironwork artists .
i think being a blacksmith is a more noble trade .
you plan to stay with us ?
no , no . i came in like the wind , just to drop off julienne .
i thought you dropped in to say hi .
that too , of course .
my god ; this heat ! tell me ,
marceau , my grandson .
how 's he doing ?
his condition is stable the doctors tell me .
but they may have to perform a thoraco .
- a thoracoplasty .
it 's an operation consisting of compressing the diseased lung by removing some ribs .
- in his case , 6 .
- that 's terrible !
- are you going back ? - no .
he 's asked us to leave .
one-eyed bitch !
i would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health .
children should not have to suffer . and how is your leg doing ?
a bit of pain , that 's all .
the real burden is inaction . lucky for me , i have olivier .
- he seems well acclimatised . - yes .
he 's very happy , here .
but you must take him back to paris .
oh no .
that 's out of the question !
victoria !
i am your father . this is my home . i 'm in charge .
and you 'll listen to me , for god 's sake !
i worked with him almost every day .
he 's a very bright boy .
he 's inquisitive , devours books .
with a bit of help , he 'll become someone .
he must be allowed to further his studies .
you have no right to condemn him to ignorance .
sometimes i wonder if perhaps i wasn 't too hard on him .
well , speak of the devil . - good day , aunt .
- i am happy to see you again .
- likewise , aunt .
your grandfather tells me you like it here .
yes , aunt .
you know what would make him happy ?
- going up to see marceau .
- that won 't happen .
it 's true ! show her the letter .
your aunt was clear : he doesn 't want to see anyone .
he 's was cruel toward me , this morning .
- i 'm sure he 'll want to see me .
- listen ,
victoria , it would do marceau a lot of good !
well .
if you 're ready in 5 minutes , i 'll drop you off at the sanatorium .
there is an evening coach .
- thank you , aunt . - remember : 5 minutes ! - i 'll be ready .
- hey !
olivier , before you go , drink a bit of wine and chew on some garlic .
it will give you strength .
and repel evil .
guillaume , please ! stop the car at the next curve .
marceau is lost , olivier .
the doctors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope .
you must not tell anyone . do you understand ?
- i swear , aunt . ah !
my god .
it 's not fair !
he suffers immensely .
you 'll see , he 's changed .
but he mustn 't find out .
anyway , who knows .
perhaps there is still a chance .
i 'm sure of it , my aunt .
i 'm sure of it .
i don 't have the courage .
he 's inside that building .
room 18 . second floor .
you 'll have to sneak in , children are not allowed .
don 't worry .
thank you , aunt .
i know you . you 're his cousin .
you can 't stay here . he 's not in his room .
he 's outside , in the solarium .
- go on !
- thanks .
- it 's you , my little outcast .
i knew you would come .
- how did you get here ? - your mother brought me .
you see , the divine isn 't that bad .
have a seat .
by the way , bravo for the stunt you pulled at the college .
your letter cracked me up . a work of art !
how are you feeling ?
i hope you didn 't come for a medical report .
it boils down to one word : irrecoverable .
that 's not true .
after your operation , things will improve .
that 's right ...
hope that everything will go well after losing half your ribs !
i must admit , i 'm a little pessimistic .
you see , olivier .
i would have preferred dying in new york .
or on the bridge of a transatlantic .
much better than here , don 't you think ?
olivier , i beg you .
you remember ... ?
the concert by louis armstrong ?
we share so many memories you and i .
we do indeed !
grandpa embraces you warmly .
tell him i 'm doing well .
how is he ?
his leg still hurts .
you know , we almost succeeded to come see you .
- we were forced to turn back , though .
- darn escoulas , hasn 't changed a bit .
well , here comes my guardian angel .
as you can see , i have nothing to complain about .
i was rude with julienne this morning .
i would like you to watch over her . extend her the love i was incapable of giving her .
okay ? - do you promise ?
- i promise , marceau .
alright , time to go .
and please ...
- don 't come back to see me .
- why ? - please .
- you can 't stay , olivier .
i told you already .
children are not allowed .
don 't be angry with him .
you 'll see , you 'll like it up here .
this is the best mattress ever .
so put your mind at rest .
have you seen these old books ?
" le tour de la france by two children . "
- of course it 's good . with that i learned to read to my wife .
- may i open it ?
look at this beautiful medal .
it was your father 's . with palms .
and what 's this ?
belongs to my daughter .
- aunt victoria ?
- yes .
long ago , with only an orange , you could celebrate christmas eve .
oh yes ! back then , we didn 't have the luxury of going ... to the hospital in a carriage .
life was really harsh ... and money was hard to come by . we would fight over it .
have you seen this funny boot ?
all bloated and with an enormous sole .
that shoe belonged to your dad .
you see , we send boys to their death before they can experience life .
your poor father .
when he came back to this country , after he was injured ,
i didn 't recognize him . all i could say was : " there you are . "
he wept .
he walked between two crutches , still bore shrapnel in his skin ,
his lungs burnt by the gas .
to think he was once as swift as a squirrel , only to stagger into a cloud .
he would raise his eyes , as if to prepare an answer , but he said nothing .
your mother restored his taste for life .
just enough time to make a little darling .
and now he 's gone .
i can 't sleep .
marceau is always on my mind .
it is so unfair .
we were planning on getting married .
i would do anything for him to be cured .
don 't worry .
soon , he 'll be well again .
he told me that even if he was to recover , he would no longer marry me .
he said that only because he doesn 't want to leave you with any regrets . - you think so ?
- i 'm sure .
this illness has really changed him .
besides , there 's this other girl , the nurse .
don 't cry , julienne . don 't .
you know , he doesn 't really care about charlotte .
- i don 't know .
i don 't know anymore . - it 's true !
he told me .
don 't worry .
kiss me , olivier .
not like that , you idiot .
marceau !
- not really , no .
i think i 'll go back to paris .
i thought you were going to stay here a few days .
i 'm too close to marceau , here .
victor ?
would you mind taking me to the station ?
i 'm really busy with work , you know . olivier could take you .
he can steer a buggy .
you must not loiter on the way .
you will come home right after .
- you know , i can go by myself . - no .
a young girl should never travel alone .
he 's right .
by the way , the other day in langeac , i saw a used wireless .
- for a good price . - no music in my house !
why not ?
- a bit of music , here and there .
- no , no .
novelties are bearers of misfortune .
it seems you like to dwell in it .
you don 't want water springing from a pipe , so you carry a bucket .
you don 't want music that could uplift our spirits .
you can 't live in the past or among the dead forever , mother .
i can live with mine , thank you .
line 24 , arriving from puy-en-velay , en route to paris via clermont-ferrand , immediate departure , platform 1 .
it was sweet of you to accompany me , olivier .
we 'll meet again in paris , some day ?
victor was right , it 's a pity you are leaving .
- we were happy together .
- you 're a sweetie . - marceau asked me to watch over you .
- and you 've succeeded nicely .
are you crazy , you little pervert !
- what 's the matter ? the other night ... - quiet !
warm-blooded , just like your mother .
- you have no right to say that !
- oh yeah ?
how do you call a woman who had lovers ?
none of your business .
she did as she pleased .
victoria said your mother was a small-time goddess .
it 's not her fault if privat tried to shoot her .
not her fault ? well there 's a good one !
why do you say that ?
my poor olivier !
if you only knew what your mother did to privat .
what did she do to him ?
- tell me , julienne ! - i can 't tell you .
attention , now departing .
go and see privat .
he lives on a big estate called les bruyeres .
he 'll tell you what really happened .
we 'll meet again .
later .
giddy-up !
come on , faster !
giddy-up !
hue , nono !
easy , easy , nono .
whoa !
i 'd like to speak to mr. privat .
it 's very important . yes , i see .
he shouldn 't be long .
you can wait in the living room .
follow me .
it 's your mother , olivier .
a friend of mine made that bust .
she was about to turn 18 .
i thought you wouldn 't want to see me again .
i didn 't come for you .
i need to know something .
- it 's very important .
- i 'm listening .
why did you want to kill my parents .
what did they do to you ?
i was your ... your mother 's first husband . my mother 's first husband ?
your mother couldn 't bring herself to tell you she was divorced . she didn 't want you troubled by that .
we got married before the war .
we were living together and then i was called to the front .
at the same time your father was .
we were childhood friends , all three of us .
when he got injured , in october of 1914 , and was released from duty , your mother took care of him .
i thought they met when father came back wounded from the war ? no . no .
but your mother was indeed his nurse .
months and years went by .
then one day , i received a disheartening letter ... from your mother . she was leaving for paris , with your father .
- it 's not true .
you 're lying ! - no .
you 'll be the only one to know the truth .
a truth i have never revealed . to anyone .
upon reading the letter , i was shattered , forlorn .
i wanted to find your mother .
in the spring of 1917 , during general nivell 's offensives ,
i had volunteered to perform inspections on a fort we had retaken .
i picked up a grenade , unpinned it , then i pushed my arm through a gun slit ,
and held it until my arm blew off .
that 's how i became a war hero .
weeks later , i left the hospital and headed for paris .
with the intent of killing your parents , and turning the gun on myself . there it is .
olivier !
- i hope you 'll forgive me .
- my parents would never have done that !
it 's not their fault , olivier . it 's the war that created this mess .
this can 't be true .
i will never forgive them !
they 're no longer my mother nor my father !
you have no right to judge them !
you 'll understand this later on .
it is possible to love ... and then no longer love .
we 're not masters ...
- shut up !
olivier !
move on , nono ! move on !
giddy-up !
giddy-up !
giddy-up !
olivier ! charlotte ?
what 's going on ? it 's marceau ?
marceau ?
no . don 't worry .
he 's over there , in the car .
how is he ?
they wouldn 't let him go out , but he persuaded the director . he wanted to see you .
they will operate tomorrow .
you 'll see .
he 's weakened , but keeps in good spirits .
so , my little outcast ? - you 're now a shepherd ?
- you 're crazy , marceau .
you should be resting !
but i am resting , here .
don 't say anything to your grandpa ?
let him cherish the image of a young man in perfect health , rather than one of deterioration .
besides , i came for you .
i got your letter .
i needed to talk to you ..
- you didn 't have to come . - i know that .
i wanted to ask you something .
what is it ?
you must forgive your parents , olivier .
do not judge them , as i often did with mine .
since i 've been living with death , i find these judgments so ludicrous .
your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them ? no .
- but look at what they did to mr. privat !
- it 's all the same .
the love they had for each other ... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same medal .
you cannot split them apart .
do you understand ?
remember , olivier .
one day , you said that my life and death wouldn 't have meaning just for me .
so now , i want you to trust me .
it 's the last time ...
you 're crazy , marceau !
we 'll see each other after the operation !
don 't be silly .
do what i say .
promised ?
i know you 're going back to school in paris .
but before you go , i want you to visit your parents ' grave .
and tell them that you love them .
how can i tell them ?
if you put your heart into it , they 'll hear you .
really ?
yes .
i have a book on the language of flowers .
i 'll offer them a rose .
a red rose .
it 's a symbol of love .
crazy love .
bravo .
you see , when you want to .
now , now .
don 't start that again .
we 'll see each other again !
we 'll travel to america .
we 'll go cheer louis armstrong at the cotton club .
we 'll have a great time !
- what do you say , my olive ?
- let 's do it !
courage , my little urchin !
you old fart !
i 'm the editor of " l 'illustration . "
i 'm here for odilon hubert , the algerian mp .
he 's over there .
thank you .
mr. hubert ?
i 'm camille bruyere .
as the first man to represent frenchmen in algeria , my newspaper would like to devote an article to you .
- about algeria ?
- no , about you .
about me ?
a shakespearean tragedy with blood and violence ?
our readers love that , sir .
is that so ?
it 's another country , young man . another world . a land of extremes .
scalding days , freezing nights . the choking smell of goat and jasmine .
let me take notes .
it 's about other religions and peoples .
it 's about arabs , fanatical muslim warriors who only love horses and arms .
that 's great .
how will you explain to your readers the new race of french settlers , the truly exotic mix of corsicans , people from the rouergue , the ariege , the spaniards , jews and maltese ?
let 's give it a try and start at the beginning .
when did you get to algeria ?
i arrived in oran in 1837 with my friend helie toussaint .
i was a medical officer and he was an interpreter .
algeria was a world filled with wild dreams .
everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this newly conquered land .
we 'd been fighting for 7 years .
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 1 .
the emir 's doctor
he 's the guy on the black stallion .
and i , jean-baptiste fremond , will get abd el-kader !
the colonel wanted you to see the interior of algeria .
you 'll have your fill .
wait for my signal to shoot .
i 've been in the field for 3 years and i haven 't killed a single arab yet !
if you shoot , you 'll get court martialed !
crap !
shit !
the sly old dog !
curse your mother 's religion !
let him die , doc !
take care of our wounded .
- he 's a man like you and me .
- maybe like you , not me .
you 're naive .
you won 't live long if you keep this up .
hey interpreter , ask this guy where they spent the night .
who gave them food and shelter ?
tell him i 'll shoot him in the head if he lies .
- temouchent . - shit !
- let 's go .
- what about him ?
bring him .
i 'll show him what i 'm made of .
breteuil !
dumas !
shit !
savages !
burn that damn village !
set the whole town ablaze !
cut down the trees !
burn their crops !
those brutes must die !
- take them all !
- even the women ?
i said " them all , " lieutenant !
women and children too ! - why the women ?
- arabs buy and sell women like cattle .
the ugly ones become slaves .
they invented razzias , lieutenant , not us .
the only thing arabs respect is strength .
that 's the only thing those fanatics understand .
strength .
imagine our despair .
helie and i were saint-simonians .
we hadn 't come to algeria for this , but to unite the east and the west like we 'd sworn to do a few months earlier in paris .
you are now brothers through saint-simon . apostles of a new christianity .
we saint-simonians , who follow the teachings of our master , the late count of saint-simon , a remarkable economist and philosopher , want to build a new society based on progress .
engineers , polytechnicians and bankers , we 'll spread our message around the world .
let 's leave for africa , for the regency of algiers over which the french flag now flies .
let 's all swear to unite the east 's spiritual values with the material ones of the west .
we swear !
we swear !
hello , ferdinand .
mother , you know ferdinand de lesseps .
mr. de lesseps .
he 's going to egypt with father enfantin to build a canal linking the mediterranean to the red sea .
a canal ?
what ever for ?
so india-bound boats won 't need to go around africa .
those are the pereire brothers , very rich bankers .
mother , this is my friend helie toussaint .
we 're going to algeria together .
he 's an interpreter and i 'll act as medical officer in oran .
we 'll build a new world over there , madam .
all men will be equal , regardless of race or religion .
on the barbary coast ! my god !
have a seat , mother .
excuse me .
- i don 't know that friend . - he 's a new one .
allow me to congratulate you , mrs. hubert .
your son odilon is a good boy and a zealous apostle of our saint-simonian cause .
- i fear for him , sir .
- why is that ?
you 're sending him to algeria , a war- and cholera-ridden land .
of course .
but it 's an exciting mission :
to wake up slumbering islam and create a new society .
my only son with arabs !
- we 're to meet the colonel .
- he 's busy at the moment .
- we 'll wait here .
- as you wish .
did you know colonel lamoriciere was saint-simonian too ?
i 'm not surprised .
he went to the polytechnique , so he must be in favor of progress .
- goodbye , mr. bensimon . - goodbye .
interpreter helie toussaint .
medical officer , major odilon hubert .
at ease .
i know .
father enfantin told me about your coming to algeria .
welcome to this beautiful country where much remains to be done .
follow me .
i 'll brief you .
we 're occupying the ports of algiers , bone and oran .
our only intention , at first , was to occupy the coastline , like the turks .
that isn 't what we saw when we arrived , colonel .
this is clearly a war to conquer and exterminate the arabs .
i know .
some parisian newspapers wrote that we 're more barbarian than the barbarians .
they 're unfortunately right .
but whose fault is it ?
abd el-kader has started a holy war against us .
he swore to throw us into the sea .
he 's waged a vast , cruel and ruthless war against us .
we did invade his land .
we 're dealing with religions fanatics ! we have to dominate them , or they 'll drive us out and the british will take our place .
the french government doesn 't know what it wants .
ten governor-generals in 6 years !
we don 't have enough men to end this once and for all .
barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million arabs in a country 3 times the size of france .
it 's ridiculous !
yet , the saint-simonian mission is clear :
we want to help the arabs , to protect their language and their religion . we wish to let them run their own country and help them gradually take in the values of modern western civilization .
excuse me , colonel ...
how is that different from colonization ?
the land , toussaint .
the land .
we need to leave it to the arabs who are its rightful farmers .
our role is to build factories , roads and railroads .
that 's why i created the first arab offices in this land and why i set up the first zouave regiment , made up of muslim volunteers who are now our brothers in arms .
i would like to volunteer in such a regiment .
not now .
i have more important work for you .
bugeaud will be in oran next week . his mission is to seek peace with abd el-kader .
you speak arabic , toussaint ?
i can pass for egyptian .
very well .
you 'll remain incognito in the native city .
there , you 'll contact abd el-kader 's man .
you want me to spy on the arabs ?
no , we 're doing it for peace , for a good cause .
as for you , hubert , you 'll handle the cholera epidemic , which has hit our troops very hard .
- and the population even harder .
- i know . hubert will treat everyone equally .
be careful , doctor .
the other doctors before you all died of cholera .
- what about you , sister ?
- god is watching over me .
leila ?
this is leila , one of our orphans .
- she speaks arabic and french .
- hello , miss .
hello , doctor .
he 's dehydrated .
tell him to drink a lot . boiled water .
no need to be so formal with me .
i can teach you arabic .
he needs a new bandage .
i will be chaperoning your lessons with leila .
why , sister ?
don 't you trust me ?
i need to learn arabic too .
your convent 's been here over 200 years - and you don 't speak arabic ?
- i need the theory .
cover him up .
he 's in a sorry state .
i 'm discouraged , doctor . they keep dying .
i pray every day , but ...
medicine is making progress .
we now know it spreads through water .
we 'll find a cure .
try turpentine .
your protege is great !
when the poor girl was little , arabs killed her parents before her eyes .
her family 's from spain .
but she looks and speaks arabic .
her grandmother was a " mamma rosa . "
a long time ago , a boat with 10 of our spanish sisters ran aground here .
our sisters were all sold as slaves to kabyle and turkish chiefs .
the mother superior was named maria rosa , so the offspring of those forced marriages were named " mamma rosas . "
you shouldn 't laugh .
- forgive me , sister .
- we raised leila as one of our own .
tell him children have to drink a lot .
- he said , " may allah bless you . "
- get a stretcher .
hurry !
want a woman ?
you had that one yesterday .
she 's no longer a virgin .
let me in . let me in !
- what 're you doing here ?
- you 'll blow my cover .
everyone knows who you are .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission .
that 's not true .
the colonel told me to blend in , so i am .
you 've no idea what delights the east has to offer .
everything is here to please men .
these women have been raised to fulfill our every desire .
odilon , i 'm uniting with the east on a daily basis .
- want to try ?
- have you lost your mind ?
you 'll come around .
this isn 't quite the spiritual union our saint-simonian brothers had in mind .
the colonel sent me .
he hasn 't heard from you in over a month .
you risk getting court martialed .
i found a way to contact abd el-kader .
trust me .
stay .
special tricks , huh ?
i know who you are .
so do i .
why are you spying on us ?
i 'm not spying .
i 'm bringing peace .
we also seek peace .
but peace is worth nothing without freedom .
france is willing to respect your freedom . - if you stop the war . - it 's not up to me .
- tell your leader .
- only allah has the power - to decide
- i know .
allah has a lot of responsibilities .
- i 'm sure he could use our help .
- i 'll do my best .
- tell me about bahia .
- she 's beautiful .
- i know .
i saw her .
- she 's nice .
- haven 't you had enough women ?
- she 's different .
i 'm bahia .
my father , si kaddour , sent me to tell you emir abd el-kader , the leader of the holy war , is ready to broker peace .
thank you .
you 've brought me great news .
you speak french well .
my father didn 't have a son , so he taught me to read and write like a boy .
i have to go .
that means " i love you . "
- excuse me ?
- right .
- it could be useful .
yes .
but more sensuous .
yes , again .
hello , everyone !
i have great news !
- any new developments ?
- i 'm in love .
crazy in love !
what do you think ?
it 's not what you think , odilon .
this is serious .
she 's from a big tent . - excuse me ?
- from a noble family .
she 's beautiful , smart ...
- who is she ?
- si kaddour 's daughter .
- bahia ?
- you know her ?
very well .
we studied together .
that 's fantastic , leila !
you can help me .
go tell her i love her and want to marry her .
- you want to marry an ...
- an arab .
so ?
i won 't be the first .
the wife of the general in constantine is arab .
no , she 's kabyle .
leila ...
you know her , so go see her and tell her i love her .
please . i beg you ! do it for me .
arranging marriages is for old women .
she 's your friend , she 'll listen to you .
fine , i 'll play matchmaker .
just for you !
- and your mission ?
- that 's the other good news .
abd el-kader is ready to negotiate .
i notified lamoriciere , who informed bugeaud .
- there 's going to be a truce .
- you don 't know arabs .
it 's a ruse . they 'll keep fighting .
you 're one to talk , leila .
aren 't you arab ?
not at all . i 'm kabyle .
i 'm not muslim , but christian .
anyway ... religion is all that matters here .
it 's more important than blood , more important than anything !
you think he really loves me ?
he 's been with so many women .
do you love him ? i don 't know .
my father wants to give me to a friend of his .
he may be the love of your life .
all i know is i want to be his wife - and bear his children .
- sounds like love .
you know it 's up to the men .
my father won 't let me marry an infidel .
that can be arranged .
he adores you .
i don 't even know if odilon loves me .
i had to kiss him .
go see old zara for a love potion .
we already have one : this , - this and this .
- leila , you sound like a whore . that 's what we are !
fathers sell us like sheep .
don 't say that .
women serve men and bear their children .
i 'll choose my own husband .
- i 've already chosen .
- you love him ?
i want him . i 'll get him .
so ?
she loves you .
she 'll marry you on one condition .
- anything !
- she can only marry a muslim .
- that doesn 't bode well .
- there 's a way :
become muslim .
why not ?
go see the imam , say , " allah is great , " muhammad is his prophet " and it 's done !
why not ?
i 've already thought about it .
islam is a good religion .
no priests , no bishops , no pope .
just you and god .
anyway , it 's the same god for everyone .
yes , but ... circumcision ?
circumcision .
don 't worry .
the barber will give your willy a clean cut .
plus , he uses an english shaver .
sure you want to get circumcised ?
i have to to become muslim .
let me do it instead of that butcher .
he 's not a butcher , he 's a barber .
that 's worse .
you don 't know the words that need to be said .
i 'm giving a part of myself to god .
want me to go with you ?
helie !
i envied him in a way .
he threw himself into everything , while i , the good jesuit student , weighed the pros and cons for so long , i 'd never decide .
should i marry leila ?
she was beautiful and bewitching , but she scared me like this country did .
done .
- we 're brothers now .
- go !
the brute had to do it 3 times !
told you so .
i 'll bandage you at the hospital .
i 'm muslim like you , si kaddour .
you gave me your word .
" i 'll give you my daughter if you become muslim . "
will you give her to me now ?
i gave you my word , so i will . as long as the uncles agree .
what 's it to them ?
they 're the elders , wise men .
they decide for the family .
it 's tradition .
are you circumcised ?
what i wouldn 't do for you , bahia ...
so , are you done inspecting me ?
they agree .
i 'm grateful .
you can have bahia , but there 's the dowry .
the dowry .
how much ?
- 1,000 francs .
- alright .
and 50 sheep .
fifty sheep ?
where would i find those ?
buy them .
from whom ?
me .
if you want to .
- congratulations ! - thanks .
bugeaud signed a peace treaty with abd el-kader .
the treaty of tafna recognizes his authority over 2 / 3 of algeria .
the emir set up his camp on the tagdempt plateau , between mascara and the ouarsenis mountains .
i 'm worried , hubert .
why , colonel ?
you wanted everyone to stay where they belonged .
i hear he 's a loyal fellow .
he can 't stand our presence on muslim ground .
it 's a question of religion , which is sacred .
don 't forget , hubert , that the emir is a prophet as well as a military man and a poet .
only islam is capable of producing such men .
we sent him a delegation .
he requested a doctor to treat his sick mother .
i appointed you .
go to him . try to get in his good graces and keep me apprised each week .
you can count on me , colonel .
enjoy your dinner , last night ?
yes , colonel .
on behalf of my master , emir abd el-kader , prince of the faithful , defender of the prophet 's religion , welcome .
on behalf of france and science , i came to help the emir and his family .
our emir is sad .
his mother , the holy and revered zohra , is seriously ill .
if you cure her , he 'll shower you with gifts .
i don 't need gifts .
your master 's gratitude will be ample reward .
- she 's burning up !
- it often happens to her .
it 's malaria .
- then it 's up to god .
- there 's a new medication :
quinine .
i prepared a potion with quina bark .
careful . it 's quite bitter .
she must take a sip every 2 hours .
i 'll be back tomorrow .
this is your house .
just ask if you need anything .
the emir will see you tomorrow morning .
i 'll come get you .
rest in peace .
go see the french doc . you 'll do his cooking and cleaning .
the doctor is a spy .
watch his every move .
bring me anything that he writes .
got it ?
what will you give me for that ?
like she said , your uncle wants me for his harem .
your uncle 's rich .
i 'll find you a husband .
young or old , but rich .
you 're pretty , you 'll get your pick .
who are these prisoners ?
the leaders of a rebel tribe .
the ben zetoun .
welcome to my home .
have a seat .
i 'm happy that french science could serve the mother of the prince of the faithful .
it 's a good example of what we can bring your country .
medicine was invented by an arab .
i plan on setting up a university .
our doctors will be as good as french ones .
why waste time when france offered you to skip centuries and enter the modern world .
a new world could come out of the union of the east and the west .
arabs weren 't made to sow wheat and build cities .
- we 're nomads , sons of the wind .
- nothing solid is built on wind .
nothing solid is built without god .
god is with me . i only listen to him .
he forbids me from letting any muslim live - under christian domination .
- we don 't want to dominate you , but to bring you the benefits of civilization and progress .
when god wants to hurt an ant , he gives it wings .
full of pride and joy , it takes to the sky .
then a little bird sees it and swallows it .
we 'll be friends if everyone stays where they belong .
we value freedom ! only a holy war can bring freedom and independence .
a holy war never required anyone butchering their enemy , like i saw at ain temouchent .
we 've made peace .
come see me whenever you please .
you 'll be welcome wherever i am .
this is from the emir .
it 's yours .
i can 't accept it .
refusing a gift is a grave insult .
- who 's she ?
- a servant for you .
- where 's my servant ahmed ?
- he asked to join the army of the faithful .
naouel 's a better cook .
naouel .
you speak french ?
where are you from ?
kabylia .
my father worked for a french lieutenant at the arab office .
the emir 's soldiers came to our village .
they killed the lieutenant , ...
don 't worry , i 'll treat you well .
you 're my father and mother to me .
good night .
where will you sleep ?
- next door .
- there 's no bed .
i sleep on the floor .
call me if you need anything .
wait .
stay a while .
you smell nice .
let me guess ...
close your eyes .
good morning .
so , the coffee 's turkish , the milk is from a goat , but the bread is mine .
happy ?
- don 't kiss me like that .
- you 're my master , i 'm yours .
this is :
naouel was the mistress-servant every man secretly dreams of .
i dove head first into the bewitching world of islam , which mixed nobility , poetry and cruelty , and where god commanded every move .
i was far from everything , elsewhere . i never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life .
the emir had just come back from a long expedition in the sahara .
you were right , colonel .
he 's been taking advantage , these last 2 years , of the false peace to rule over the other tribes .
he 's plundered the kabylia , the ouarsenis , the titteri and now the sahara .
will he ever unite these dispersed tribes ?
if he does , it 'll be in spite of us .
the women at the souk are saying the war with the french is about to start again .
i 'm scared .
if there 's a war , you 'll leave without me .
of course not .
i 'll take you with me .
there 's a rumor that hostilities will resume against the french .
the emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infantry ,
2,000 cavalry , 20 field guns , and 240 gunners .
add to that , 60,000 irregulars armed with french rifles they got off our dead or from their prisoners , and english guns the british consul sold them .
odilon ?
helie ?
- i 'm so happy to see you !
- so am i. how are you ?
well .
have a seat .
- three stripes !
bravo !
- same to you .
haven 't you heard ? you 've been promoted .
this is such a remote place .
- hey ! she 's stealing a letter !
- no , it 's naouel .
she brings my letters to the legation .
your servant ?
- you trust her ?
- of course . well , she 's more than my servant .
she 's my girlfriend .
- are you kidding me ?
- i 'm in love .
good thing i 'm here .
you 're so naive , odilon .
she 's here to spy on you .
that 's what the arabs do !
can we talk about something else ?
what brings you here ?
i 'm here with the major .
we came to see abd el-kader to prevent a new outbreak .
what 's going on ?
our generals have captured constantine .
to join algiers and constantine , they occupied a territory abd el-kader thinks is his .
is he right ?
we 're obviously being dishonest .
so are the arabs .
abd el-kader keeps saying that god willing , he 'll throw the french into the sea .
after all , this is his land not ours .
if we leave , algeria will go back to chaos .
what about the union of the east and the west ?
we need peace first .
and freedom and equality for arabs . not a forced union .
winning is all our generals want .
they want to subdue the natives .
believe me , you should head back to oran .
- leila is waiting for you .
- how 's bahia ?
i forgot to tell you . i have a son .
- really ?
- ishmael .
he 's almost a year old .
i hope you 'll attend his circumcision .
i wouldn 't miss it .
the french didn 't keep their word .
the duke of orleans and marshal valee crossed the iron gates and violated my territory .
it 's an affront to our dignity .
i wrote to louis-philippe , the king of france .
he didn 't even reply .
my men are in favor of a holy war .
the hissing of bullets is worth more than freshwater .
that would be a mistake .
france is stronger .
it has soldiers , canons , ships .
i am not scared .
allah is with me .
my friends and i want freedom and equality for every algerian and french person .
perhaps , but it 's your generals who lay down the law .
winning is like saltwater , the more you drink ,
- the thirstier you get .
- no matter who wins , a lot of men will fall under enemy fire .
it 's fate , not bullets , that kill .
muslims are ready to die for their faith .
the koran says , " heaven lies in the shade of swords . "
i chose the honorable path : war .
warn your people , so they can 't say they weren 't given fair warning .
hadj hamou will take you to the french outpost .
may allah watch over you and your family .
i 'll never forget you saved my mother .
may allah guide you towards fair and honorable peace .
farewell .
naouel ?
- where 's naouel ?
- she 's gone .
- where ?
- back to the harem .
what ?
she 's leaving with me .
you can 't expect a muslim to follow an infidel .
- i want to see her .
- she doesn 't want to see you .
you 're lying !
she wants to leave with me .
you 're naive , lieutenant hubert .
i sent her here to spy on you .
i don 't believe you .
you 're lying .
she showed me all your letters .
" 8,000 infantry , 2,000 cavalry , 20 field guns . "
you 're well informed .
get over it .
you 're a soldier .
you should know that a man who trusts a woman isn 't a real man .
fight me !
you 're the emir 's guest .
he ordered me to see to your safety .
hospitality is sacred to muslims .
you 're my guest .
i have to protect you .
- i owe you my life .
- i 'll kill you next time .
... with sugar , milk , dates and raisins is a delight !
- leila will be eating with us .
- i see , it 's a conspiracy .
you should make up your mind .
she 's perfect for you .
- don 't you like her ?
- of course i do .
so marry her !
don 't be like every single officer here who shacks up with a broad , but won 't be seen in public with her .
sorry , i ... you 're right .
it 's all in the past .
- let 's talk shop .
excuse me , i must take care of ishmael .
i 'll join you .
leila , i wanted to tell you ...
what ?
firstly ... i have something to confess .
the kabyle girl ?
i know .
helie told me .
he should mind his own business .
it 's different between us , isn 't it ?
so you 'd be willing to ...
ladies and gentlemen , i raise my glass to captain hubert who just earned a well-deserved third stripe . to his lovely wife , our hospital 's head nurse , whose beauty and competence will support her husband 's brilliant career .
our best wishes to the newlyweds .
their union is celebrated under favorable auspices .
our troops just crushed the regular army of abd el-kader , who wanted to challenge us to a battle .
but in vain .
his troops were annihilated , thanks to my friend , colonel yusuf .
ladies and gentlemen , to love and victory !
you 're very optimistic , general .
abd el-kader has lost the battle but not the war .
he started a guerilla war and is stirring up the tribes .
here and there , perhaps .
but trust me , he lost face and therefore the game .
it 's only a question of time now .
bugeaud was named governor-general .
he 's bringing 100,000 men .
we 'll be able to pull out all the stops .
things are clear to paris .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
we 'll turn it into a modern country .
what are they doing ?
- how do you like it ?
- it 's sublime .
- thank you .
- want something to drink ? - two granitas .
- two granitas , please .
- where did you get that ?
- in a jewish store .
- it suits you .
- thank you .
i prefer north african dresses . they 're more mysterious .
eroticism relies on mystery .
is it true that abd el-kader is 20 km from algiers ?
he was . he raided the mitidja and vanished without a trace .
we haven 't seen the last of him .
this morning , we met the royal committee for the development of algeria .
there 'll be a railroad from algiers to blida .
the mineralogical map says we have coal ...
we 're late , odilon .
we 're expected at noon .
your kepi .
- wait for us for lunch . - yes .
good day to you , sir .
colonization is at a standstill .
what 's the use of conquering land if no one settles there ?
no one wants to settle on a foreign land that hasn 't been completely pacified .
it will be , lamoriciere , it will be !
i swear we 'll take out the trash by any means necessary !
but i won 't do it for swiss or austrian settlers ! those ignorant drunks !
you 're right , general .
to make the most out of these huge areas the nomadic arabs have neglected , we need big capitalist companies who possess great means .
we recommend it , as the modern and effective way .
fiddlesticks !
that 's typical of your saint-simonian friends .
a bunch of dreamers and visionaries !
you see , lamoriciere , i haven 't been to the polytechnique , unlike yourself .
i 'm a soldier and a farmer .
i learned everything on my limousin farm .
the mitidja isn 't the beauce .
may i respectfully point out , general , that the limousin isn 't the mitidja either .
believe it or not , captain toussaint , i had noticed that .
" ense et aratro . " it 's my motto .
with the sword and plow .
like cincinnatus , the roman farmer-soldier . veterans can settle here after their service is done :
plow , horse , rifle .
i 'll even give them wives .
natives ?
my chief of staff , who 's retired , is now the mayor of toulon .
he can get me servants , widows , single women ... you catch my drift .
germaine , do you take gustave to be your husband , to be faithful unto him and be part of the church ?
- i do .
- gustave , do you take germaine to be your wife , to be faithful unto her and be part of the church ?
- you are now joined in holy matrimony .
here are your rings .
poor girl .
- i hear she 's an orphan .
- who knows , she might be happy .
fat chance !
it 's the luck of the draw .
- germain , do you take ...
- know what they 're doing ?
they 've giving land to young soldiers who 've completed 5 of their 7 years of service .
- so ?
- so they won 't leave .
they 'll have to spend at least 2 more years here .
here is your title of ownership , a plow and a horse to go with it , and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards .
madam , here is the key to your house .
live happily and prosper .
here is your title of ownership , a plow and a horse to go with it , and a rifle to defend yourself against those bastards .
- thank you , general .
- madam , here is the key - to your house . - thank you .
live happily and prosper .
friends ! after having conquered this land in the name of france , you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children .
i wish you all the best .
drum roll .
we 're stealing the arabs ' land , general .
no need to exaggerate .
they weren 't using it .
but small-scale farming won 't turn algeria into beauce .
if abd el-kader lets us .
the governor chose to send 3 units after him .
i 'm to command one .
with all due respect , i 'm not sure i 'd like to join the hunt .
you don 't have a choice , toussaint .
i 've just received word you 'll be serving under the young duke of aumale who 'll command yusuf 's unit .
you 'll be his interpreter and hubert , his medical officer .
the king 's son !
that 's rather flattering .
i regret losing you , but it 'll be good for your careers .
colonel yusuf spotted the smalah .
it eluded us twice in 4 days , but we have it now .
it 's here ! by the taguine well . the troops , the women and children .
how on earth can they move camp that quickly ?
i don 't know , my lord .
it 's incredible .
is abd el-kader with them ?
i didn 't want to sound the alarm by getting too close .
- when abd el-kader isn 't there , he leaves 500 men .
we have enough cavalrymen .
let 's go .
we should wait for the infantry . they 're 3 hours away .
sound the charge , lieutenant .
my lord , the duke of aumale told me to inform you that he captured abd el-kader 's smalah at noon on may 16 .
we left with the cavalry at dawn and encountered them at noon .
i 'll never forget this extraordinaire event .
get to the point , my friend .
the african chasseurs went around the smalah to take it from the rear while colonel yusuf launched a frontal attack .
chaos and panic ensued . there was a stampede .
good .
very well indeed .
what about abd el-kader ?
he wasn 't there , general .
general ! we captured 300 notables and warlords , their families , horses and sheep , and abd el-kader 's war chest :
a wonderful booty .
it almost cost the duke of aumale his life .
coming , hubert ?
- so ?
- all hope is lost , my lord .
guard !
move away !
let the women and child go and i 'll surrender !
take them away .
you saved my life , captain .
is there anything you want ?
give me the 3 prisoners .
they 're yours .
she wants to see you .
she 's waiting for you outside .
- why did you abandon me , odilon ?
- abandon you ?
you spied on me and betrayed me .
you believed him ?
i knew it .
hadj hamou kidnapped me and put me in his harem .
and the letters ?
he only managed to get one from me .
i 'm here , odilon , to tell you
i never betrayed you .
but you doubted me .
no .
you didn 't love me enough .
is that your son ?
ours .
aissa .
no one must ever know , otherwise hadj hamou will kill my son and i .
i 'm his wife .
he put me in his harem .
he never asked me anything .
hadj hamou is a good man ,
he 's a good husband and father .
aissa and i are his .
i simply wanted you to know .
helie told me you 're married .
i am .
i had misjudged her .
- she 's a good person .
your worlds are too different .
- you 're one to talk .
- it 's not the same for me .
you think a man can love several women at once ?
muslims can have up to 4 women .
but there 's always a favorite .
some must sometimes love 2 women equally .
i 'm done .
come in .
you wanted to kill me and almost did .
- it wasn 't god 's will .
- i know i owe you my life . so you 're free to go .
- i 'll take up arms again .
- that 's your right .
- i 'm indebted to you .
- no , we 're even now .
set naouel and the child free .
we 're now bound for life , you and i .
it is our destiny .
i thought the battle of the smalah would end the war , but abd el-kader would be on the run for another 4 years .
for 4 years , helie and i witnessed yusuf and lamoriciere 's hellish razzias which were answered by piles of severed french heads .
the emir fled to morocco , where he was followed by bugeaud who won the battle of isly .
the following year , abd el-kader butchered a french battalion at sidi-brahim .
on christmas eve 1847 , after having resisted one of the most powerful countries on earth for 15 years , the emir admitted defeat .
it was god 's will .
budge call !
accept this horse as submission .
it 's the last one i 'll ride .
i will now go on foot .
i accept your homage to france , which grants you its protection , as a sign that the past has been forgiven .
you cured my holy mother .
may god watch over you and yours .
had i had men like yours , i 'd now be in algiers .
since you defeated me , you 're the only person i can entrust with the weapons i used in the last 15 years of fighting you .
i will not be needing them anymore .
i will devote the rest of my life to god .
god is great .
past enemies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart .
you may see me as alive , but i am dead .
squadron leader hubert , on behalf of his majesty louis-philippe , i appoint you knight of the legion of honor .
congratulations , hubert , and thank you again .
squadron leader toussaint , on behalf of his majesty , i appoint you knight of the legion of honor .
congratulations .
end of the proclamation !
- congratulations , dear friends .
- thank you .
you deserve it .
a lot remains to be done in this great country .
we 'll build it instead of destroy it .
you know there 's fighting in paris right now .
there 's talk of a second republic .
so we 'll finally see that republic .
- what will happen to algeria ?
- a republic means liberty , equality and fraternity for every man .
translation :
magenta baribeau epilogue
welcome to algeria , where much remains to be done .
the saint-simonians ' mission is clear :
we want to protect the arabs ' language and religion .
i came to help the emir 's family with french knowledge .
may allah protect them .
i chose the honorable path : war .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in brothels and have forgotten your mission .
i found a way to contact adbelkader .
violence is the only thing arabs respect .
these savages must die !
this is a genocide , not a war .
some parisian newspapers even wrote that we 're the barbarians .
a toast to his lovely wife .
our best wishes to the newlyweds .
you think a man can love several women simultaneously ?
there 's always a favorite .
i never betrayed you .
no one must ever know , otherwise hadj hamou will kill my son and i .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
you 're the only person i can entrust with the weapons i used to fight you these last 15 years .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 2 .
death 's fiancee
mother ...
jeremy ?
emile and jeanne must do the homework that i spent last night preparing .
thank you .
had we stayed in oran , instead of moving to this godforsaken place , our children could go to school and get a normal education .
as soon as we have the money , we 'll send them to the algiers boarding school .
did you know that the boy with typhoid died ?
i know .
i did all i could .
i hope they won 't catch it .
they played with him .
is there any milk , djamila ?
not that one .
i don 't like goat milk .
it 's sour .
there aren 't any cows here , sweetie .
we wouldn 't be here if your father hadn 't left the army .
where is he going , mother ?
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republican and pro-arab .
nothing to be ashamed of .
i was a republican .
the ' 48 revolution hit paris , then oran .
i believed in the new republic . and i still do . and i 'm most certainly pro-arab .
the europeans mixed up revolution and beatings .
i paid the price after napoleon iii 's december ' 51 coup .
don 't stay there . you have plenty of room .
spread it out !
leila wanted us to leave for france .
but leaving algeria was out of the question .
so i rented this farm from a settler from ariege who became disheartened and left with a bad fever .
" these dates are excellent . "
period .
" the umbrella is ... " a nice shade " of red . "
- what 's wrong , jeanne ?
- my stomach hurts .
you don 't have a fever .
yaouled wrote " umprella . "
- with a p !
- stop teasing yaouled .
i 'd like to see you write arabic !
he can 't write arabic either !
don 't listen to him . you 've made tremendous progress .
- he made 15 mistakes yesterday .
- you made 12 !
why isn 't ishem here ?
she 's a girl .
her father won 't allow it .
- why not ?
- she might get ideas .
alright . let 's continue .
the camel has big teeth .
yaouled , make sure your sheep don 't eat my wife 's flowers .
why are you calling me yaouled ?
i 'm ahmed .
you 're oran 's yaouled to me .
go get the others , ahmed , i 've got a surprise .
try them on . you 'll be able to work faster .
against thorns and rocks .
your week 's pay .
kader . cherif .
a gift .
clean the stables and the horses ' bedding like i showed you .
boss ! mr. charmasson is coming .
the delorme farm was attacked this morning .
you 're a doc , - there might be some wounded .
- go get my kit .
antoine ?
marie ?
savages ! madmen !
come .
there 's nothing we can do here .
go get help at the village . we 'll give them a nice burial .
madmen !
what 's the army waiting for ?
you know they hate settlers .
they 're savages !
the only solution is to eradicate them , like the americans did with the indians .
this is their land .
they were wasting it .
don 't make excuses for them !
i 'm not !
i 'm only trying to understand .
there 's nothing to understand , hubert !
their own brothers ...
why ? why !
" hadjouts " kill infidels and traitors
- so they can go to heaven . - bullshit !
that 's what the marabout said .
it 's holy war , " jihad . "
the man who kills goes to heaven .
why are they wearing their shoes around their necks ?
their feet hurt .
they prefer going barefoot .
- but they cost me a fortune !
- good .
they won 't get used .
the workers want to invite you and your wife to thank you .
there 's way too much .
we can 't eat all this .
politeness dictates you have to eat a lot .
then you burp and say that you 're full .
he 'll be pleased .
this is stupid .
they probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning .
- they 're generous and behaving like lords .
it 's delicious .
he has trachoma .
we have to do something .
he can come to the farm whenever he wants .
it 's because of marie . - it 's a race .
- they should close the valve .
that 's right , blame allah .
- you 're not married ?
- i 'm not rich enough .
wash his eyes everyday or he 'll become blind .
always wash children 's hands and faces .
- we don 't have much water .
- come get some at the farm .
not too tired ?
are you due soon ?
mother ...
jeanne is crying .
what 's wrong ?
what 's going on ?
typhoid fever !
i knew it .
she 'll die !
- calm down .
we 'll treat her .
- stop it ! i 'm a nurse !
everyone around is dying of cholera , typhoid and dysentery !
you 're exaggerating .
428 people died at the " funduq " last year .
and 94 in boufarik .
the mitidja is a rotten swamp !
the arabs were right calling it " death 's fiancee . "
if the mosquitoes don 't get us , hadjouts will slit our throats
- and we 'll all die ! - enough !
you 're exhausted .
go to bed .
i 'll take care of jeanne .
yes , i 'm exhausted .
i can 't stand it .
i want to leave .
i 'll leave with the kids if you want to stay .
how will you get by ?
we don 't have any money .
i 'll find work as a nurse or as a maid .
the children will go to school .
i want to leave .
then leave !
i can 't stand your constant whining !
come with us . i beg you !
no .
i belong here .
- hurry , mother !
i 'll go see the chief physician at the mustafa hospital .
he agreed to hire me .
- he 's a good man .
- i hope you 'll enjoy yourself .
algiers is full of thieves and adventurers .
will you come visit ?
i 'll visit the children . time permitting .
take them to blida .
the army has set up convoys to algiers .
goodbye , sweetie .
goodbye , emile .
- bye , djamila .
- we never should have come here .
i know .
take care of yourself .
gee up !
i 've had enough of paris .
it 's so gray and expensive here .
i don 't have any friends .
why don 't we go home to algiers ?
i hear leila and her children are there .
- what about odilon ?
- he stayed on the farm .
i don 't get him .
we always said :
the land is for the arabs , commerce , industry and mines for the french .
you 're not listening to me .
i don 't feel at home here .
the children are teased at school because they 're muslim and the salesgirls don 't respect me .
i 'm fighting for you , the children and the algerians , so people will respect your religion , values and the color of your skin .
algeria 's fate is being decided here in paris .
we 've been here for years and no one listened to you .
the republic no longer exists . the republic no longer exists .
this is an empire , but nothing has changed .
you 're wrong .
remember fleury ?
- the young lieutenant ?
- he 's a general now ,
his majesty 's closest advisor .
i sent him my pamphlets and my book .
he read them to the emperor .
it 'll happen , you 'll see .
then we 'll go home ? i promise .
we 'll go home to algeria .
i love you , bahia .
so it doesn 't matter where we are .
you 're right .
my dear toussaint , we have good news for you .
they 're about to start building the algiers-blida railroad .
our friend fournel is surveying algeria 's mineral resources . - he sent his report .
- quite promising .
- we plan to invest .
- large sums .
thank you , sirs .
with your help , algeria will become
- a modern country .
- apologies for my tardiness .
we 're making headway . the emperor freed adbelkader and authorized him to leave france for turkey .
as the duke of aumale and general lamoriciere had promised him when he surrendered over 5 years ago .
despite this promise , france kept him prisoner - all these years . - i know , i know .
that was during king louis-philippe 's reign .
the emperor made amends .
he brought adbelkader to longchamp races , the opera , awarded him the legion of honor .
we 're now best friends .
won 't his liberation fuel algeria 's holy war ?
he promised never to take up arms against france .
the only way to ensure peace in algeria is to make it an independent colony where all algerians would be equal citizens .
the emperor is in favor of that .
he spent most of his exile in england and admires
- british institutions .
- so what 's he waiting for ? it 's time to give that territory its own statute .
he has other worries :
russia , italy ...
didn 't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that algeria was and would remain a french province ?
isn 't this matter already closed ?
i hope not .
wanting arabs to abide by french rules would be a mistake .
they have different customs and values and another religion .
grab a plate . eat with me .
no , it 's pork .
- i can 't eat it .
- there must be some chicken too .
thank you .
straight ! you want a straight line !
get out of here !
i said leave !
there you are .
can you tell that idiot to leave my land ?
these darn nomads don 't respect private property .
of course .
they don 't know what that is .
what he say ?
that it 's communal land that belongs to everyone .
are you kidding ?
he knows i bought it from the government .
scram !
look at that strange set-up .
it 's a great concept .
the camel is strong , but doesn 't walk straight .
the donkey does .
- it 's quite ingenious .
- i see you 're still pro-arab . they 're bad neighbors .
so you sent your wife and kids to algiers ?
- she wanted to leave .
- can 't blame her .
this is a hard place for women and children .
come see me tomorrow .
i 'll be planting a liberty tree .
we can have a drink .
it 'll take your mind off things .
friends , this liberty tree is just like those we planted in france during the ' 48 revolution , a symbol of our faith in the republic .
napoleon iii desecrated the second republic and deported 12,000 of us to these wild african lands .
why ?
because guerin stood on the highest barricade at the faubourg saint-antoine .
because roucaries refused to use his journalistic talents to serve the usurper .
bravo !
and you , ludovic , because the townspeople had elected you republican mayor !
they wanted to break us , but we and our spanish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this algerian land are capable of !
let 's turn this rotten mitidja into a garden that we can one day transform into a new republic .
i propose the creation of a settlers association and a newspaper , " the settler 's voice , "
that roucaries will manage .
long live the republic !
music !
don 't forget republican principles mean liberty , equality and fraternity for everyone , including arabs .
you must be kidding , hubert .
these savages cut our compatriots ' throats !
you want to turn them into frenchmen ?
you abolished slavery in ' 48 .
be coherent .
arabs are men like you and i. we 're all brothers .
what a sermon !
leave that to the arab representatives .
beni sassen 's kaid is throwing a party next week .
captain audran invited us .
come with , you 'll see .
you 're going ?
it 's id al-adha , an important muslim holiday . we sacrifice sheep to commemorate abraham 's sacrifice .
wasn 't abraham jewish ?
judaism , christianity and islam are sister religions ,
talking about sheep ...
you know it 's the nomads ' main source of income .
they say they don 't have enough grazing fields .
audran , i see what you 're getting at .
their sheep grazing on our land is a real problem .
they trample our seedlings and eat our wheat .
one flock of sheep grazed on your land .
we paid the fine .
they 're nomads . they can go elsewhere .
each tribe follows its own route .
setting foot on another tribe 's land could start a war .
that 's their problem .
you 're not making my job any easier .
we 're trying to build trust with tribes loyal to our country but the encampment policy , which was adopted against the army 's advice and gave you land that belonged to the arabs , is turning the tribes against us and undermining our work .
what work ?
we 're the workers here , not you or them .
you wouldn 't be here without the army !
that 's an entrance !
yes , they know how to fight !
you said it .
you don 't want these horsemen to become our enemies again .
don 't worry , captain .
we know how to defend ourselves .
sure .
like the delormes family .
be careful , boss .
why ?
the marabout said , " the time has come .
" take the frenchman 's land , sheep and wife .
everything ! "
then everyone chanted , " god is great . "
they 've been saying this for 20 years , but we 're still here .
boss !
the workers !
- what about them ?
- they left .
- what do you mean ?
- the workers , sheep ,
- horses and mules , all gone !
- do you know where they went ?
no .
- they 're all gone ?
damn it !
they even took their shoes !
i thought they hurt their feet !
- they can sell them at the souk .
- and the cattle ?
- you think they stole all this ?
the hadjout .
mr. said listened and cheered on the marabout .
- take this and guard the farm .
- where are you going , boss ?
to get a horse - and find them . - be careful , boss .
hadjouts are very mean .
- let me call the army .
- certainly not ! - there 'd be a massacre .
- hadjouts will butcher you .
they know who i am .
thanks for the horse !
what if leila was right ?
i 'm a doctor , not a farmer .
maybe i should give up and leave .
then i realized it 's too late .
we have to stay , change these people , give them laws , civilize them .
i was crazy about algeria .
it 's such a beautiful country .
i come as a friend .
- i 'm not armed !
- where are my workers ?
- they work for us now .
you work your own brothers like slaves ?
punishment for their betrayal .
the hadjouts i met were abdelkader 's best warriors . now they 're just cutthroat murderous cowards !
they violated a saint 's grave ! that 's sacrilege !
they were punished .
it 's god 's law .
- pay !
- i have no money .
heard that ? they want your wife .
we 'll visit your wife . she 'll pay for you .
kill me now .
we 'll show her this and she 'll come get you .
she 'll bring the army .
you 'll all be shot !
aicha ...
i read your articles and pamphlet on algeria .
let me say that i completely disagree with your arabophile views .
you 're entitled to your opinion .
i suppose you 're an arabophobe ?
call it what you will .
as departmental head of the algerian government my views are not theoretical , but based on real things .
i thought we were discussing people - and not things .
- what are your views ?
the cross and the crescent are irreconcilable .
christians and muslims cannot live together unless one dominates the other .
- why should christians dominate ?
- it 's the law of the jungle .
you 're shocked ?
this is how it 's been throughout history .
we 're the masters of algeria .
why can 't the cross and the crescent get along ?
the arabs have refused to cooperate these last 20 years .
they wage wars on us , cut our settlers ' throats , burn our farms , dream of throwing us in the sea .
it 's because we see them as the defeated and not as partners .
what if cossacks or prussians still occupied paris ? if they had burned your family home in normandy , seized your land and destroyed your churches ?
forgive me , general , but i refuse to continue to debate with someone who compares our troops to cossacks !
this is insufferable !
come , darling .
can you believe that fool ?
to think they 're considering him for the secretary general position in algiers .
he treated me like a " moukere . " i put him in his place .
you should have seen the look on his face !
you did well , bahia .
general fleury offered me an assignment in algiers .
my articles and my book are quite popular over there .
- say you 'll take me with you .
- of course i will .
and we 'll visit odilon .
i haven 't heard from him in over a year .
leila wrote me that she 's worried about him .
you smell nice .
do as i say .
- you were with those thieves ?
- when abdelkader surrendered , i took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart .
how is your son ?
- i 'm trying to make him a man .
- may allah watch over him .
abdelkader and i only wished to go to the mecca , but the french didn 't keep their word and kept him prisoner .
so i joined the hadjout . you saw it :
lions became vultures . - murderers .
- it 's not their fault .
the french are stronger .
you fought valiantly .
the time for peace has come .
i 'll speak to governor randon on your behalf .
god willing .
he 's the only one i trust .
it 's up to him .
enough about god !
he helps those who help themselves !
my mind 's made up . i 'm going to algiers .
you 're deserting , hubert .
farming is hard work ,
- but we can 't give up . - my wife was right .
we 're not made to live this way .
you 'll find someone else to lease the farm .
that 's not the problem .
spaniards can work it .
think it over .
need some help ?
boss , i want to go to algiers with you .
i can guard your house , take the children to school , - anything !
- of course .
- your wife will be thrilled .
- you think so ?
she cried a lot when i took her to blida .
you 're part of the family .
you 're like a mother and father to me .
i fell in love with the white city of algiers that embraces the mediterranean shore .
leila had waited for me and forgiven me .
she worked as a nurse , was radiantly happy , had found her place in society .
i finally set up my own practice .
algiers 's european community was expanding by the day .
i had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a french province .
not for military men , but for settlers turning this place into a new country .
odilon !
how are you ?
let me introduce our copy editor , benjamin bensoussan , and jeanne , the " illustration " correspondent .
hello .
excuse me . what do you think of this ?
i went all out .
it 's 4 pages long .
there 's your biography , what happened to you , everything !
you 'll become a hero to the colony !
here 's your tale .
you 're very talented !
i said that before , haven 't i ?
we should team up .
i could sell you half my shares .
- i don 't have any money .
- same here !
buy them on credit .
- let 's shake on it .
- sold . i 'm for the settlers , now i know how they operate .
you finally got it .
it 's all here in my editorial .
" paris 's indifference . " the army 's incompetence and arrogance .
" native laziness . "
read the conclusion ! i showed randon what 's what !
" down with the sword . it 's time for civil power .
" algeria is french ! "
- want to show me around ?
- with pleasure .
children , did you know your father is a hero ?
it 's in all the newspapers .
- don 't exaggerate .
- i heard about it in school .
why are you a hero , father ?
did you kill a lot of arabs ?
- no . why would you think that ?
- when we play cops and robbers , the robbers are always arabs .
ridiculous !
i 'll have a word with your teacher !
they won 't let me be a cop .
- why not ?
- they say i 'm mixed .
what 's that ?
someone who 's half-half .
half french and half arab .
- am i half arab ?
- i don 't wanna be !
you 're not .
you 're a quarter kabyle .
- pass me the jam .
- isn 't that the same ?
not at all !
kabyles are not arabs .
so i can be a cop .
yes .
of course you can play cop , but you can 't kill anyone .
- got it ?
- hurry up , you 'll be late .
- bye .
- have a nice day .
make sure you pay attention .
- bye , sweetie .
- do we understand each other ?
- yes .
- have a nice day .
everyone is talking about you .
i like it here .
i feel like i 'm in france .
- but with arabs .
- we live separately here .
i have to go .
general randon asked me to come see him .
see you tonight .
so , hubert , you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you 're a retired officer , aren 't you ?
- i am , general .
- and you write for this rag , run by roucaries .
a commie !
we should have sent him to new caledonia .
- he 's a republican , general .
- a commie ! an anarchist !
he defends mercenaries , adventurers and deportees who come to algeria to exploit native labor !
let me remind you , general , that the settlers are colonizing and farming this land - on behalf of france .
- land that the army conquered !
we 'll discuss this some other time .
i asked you here because you 're familiar with the mitidja .
i 'm worried . new incidents have been reported .
marabout sidi yacoub travels the area and gets them all worked up .
it 's an epidemic !
reports of so-called marabouts all over the country , calling for " jihad . "
- they have monkeys and goats . - it 's an old tradition .
they capture the imagination of the naive and ignorant who fall for their cheap tricks .
- they 're illusionists .
- exactly .
- ever heard of robert houdin ?
your marabouts couldn 't hold a candle to him .
- i asked paris to send him here .
- i fail to see the connection .
arabs are a superstitious people .
they 're amazed by sleight of hand .
i 'll show them a better magician than all their marabouts .
robert houdin !
general bugeaud once tried to send them false prophets .
they were all murdered .
this is different !
this one 's french !
i 'd bet you anything that he 'll amaze them !
he amazed me , so ...
the arabs want to see wonders , so i 'll show them wonders !
one last thing , i 'm told you 're friends with an author called toussaint , a man turning paris upside down , demanding that arabs
- be considered our equals ?
- i am . he 's here , on a mission for general fleury .
i had to give him an office .
i 'm not sure what he 's up to , but i don 't like it , so i 'm having him followed .
try to get some information out of him and keep me apprized .
want some wine , boss ?
ahmed , i told you to call him " sir . "
sorry .
want some wine , sire ?
- sir .
- no , i 'm fine , yaouled .
and stop calling him yaouled .
his name 's ahmed .
didn 't i tell you ?
i decided we should frenchify our lifestyle .
i ordered restoration armchairs .
i like the sitting room the way it is .
that stuck-up woman at the general 's asked if i was a moor !
that 's why . that 's not an insult .
you 're half spanish , a quarter kabyle and a quarter french .
and the end result is not bad at all .
i 'm french !
i don 't want people thinking i 'm a " moukere ! "
did you know the toussaints were here ?
the moved into one of the best palaces in algiers .
i know . he 's important now .
he 's general fleury 's agent and speaks for parisian arabophiles .
i saw bahia this afternoon .
she 's putting on airs now that she 's lived in paris .
- sauce ?
- please .
she invited us to dinner tomorrow night .
i 'm looking forward to seeing helie .
- isn 't this a bit cold ?
- no .
sorry , but it is .
yaouled ?
ahmed .
ahmed !
could we have forks ?
i don 't eat with my hands anymore .
so ?
i don 't understand why you stopped writing me .
you let me down .
you 'd promised to ask your friends to help me .
- i 'm still waiting .
- sorry , it wasn 't easy with all these changes of regime : first a kingdom , then a republic , and now an empire .
- you don 't know how it is .
- i do .
judging by your stripes , you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
what happened to you ?
you 've changed .
while you were having fun in paris , - i went through hell here !
- why did you become a settler ?
that 's enough .
i 've heard enough .
go see how they live on the mitidja !
i now understand what " bad settlers " are .
excuse me .
- how are your children ?
- well .
and yours ?
well .
i 'd like them to live here .
why ?
they 're lucky enough to study in france .
excuse me .
i 'd like them to know their homeland and to speak arabic .
what for ?
what 's important is that they speak french .
it 's their culture , their roots .
i don 't want them to deny their origins , like others do .
is this why you still wear a " jellaba " ?
i 'm proud to wear it .
and it will never go out of style .
it 's their damn religion that puts them to sleep .
medieval fatalism .
what are you doing to help them ?
touring robert houdin disguised as a marabout ?
you want them to stay ignorant so you can dominate them .
we have to defend ourselves .
your desertion policy would have us all leave within 5 years .
did you forget our dream of uniting the east and the west ?
only equality and progress can give arabs their dignity back .
they don 't want your progress .
ask our saint-simonian brothers . ask talabot .
they 're sabotaging his railroad .
to modernize the country , we need to impose our laws and our better institutions . it 's not only in our interest ,
- but in theirs .
- am i really hearing this ?
you sound like those colonialists i keep meeting here in algiers !
i found more support for algerians in paris !
it 's easy to be pro-arab when you live in paris .
no one is on your side here , not governor , army or settlers .
you 've already lost the battle .
i 'll be frank .
your newspaper is jeopardizing our collaboration with arabs .
this might result in a war .
there 's nothing left to be said .
let 's go .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how sad .
they 're hopeless .
misfortune has made them bitter .
i , hadj hamou , give you my horse as well as this sword with which i 've always fought fairly .
my life is in your hands .
you can have my son as a symbol of my sincerity .
may god help you decide our fate .
as a show of faith , i 'll let you keep your sword and horse , but i 'll take care of your son .
he can serve france when he 's older .
go back to your people and live peacefully .
drum roll !
i 'll only use it to defend my new friends if they 're attacked .
i 'll see to it that he goes to a good school , so he can follow in his father 's footsteps .
france 's flag is wide and can shelter all those who seek refuge and protection .
i spent 20 years of my life fighting , killing and destroying .
i will now devote myself to peace and rebuilding .
i could take care of him and his studies .
under one condition .
which is ?
that you let him be muslim .
i swear to your god and mine to do so .
i 'll care for him as if he were my own .
how long will that boy stay in our home ?
i don 't know .
it 'll depend on his studies .
he eats with his hands . he doesn 't know how to use a fork .
he 'll learn .
this is what we 're here for .
you treat that child better than your own .
- good night , father .
good night , mother .
- good night , mother .
- good night , sidi baba .
- good night .
you 're not his father .
he 's only repeating what he 's heard .
you 've got a new nightgown .
where did you get it ?
i got some proper clothes .
why do you always hide that you 're kind-hearted ?
- i want to see father . - go on .
- stop touching my things !
don 't mind him . he 's just mean .
you can play with me .
a pearl .
- a chair .
- a table .
- a girl .
- a pearl .
not a pearl .
a girl .
" a girl . "
a boy .
" a boy . " a girl . a boy .
go to bed .
but say your prayers first .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee , blessed art thou amongst women ...
i was a medical officer , he , an interpreter .
it was a mythical algeria .
wanting arabs to abide by french rules would be a mistake .
they 're our partners , ...
the doc is a spy .
watch his every move .
- bring me all his letters .
- i 'm in love .
she 's here to spy on you .
that 's what the arabs do !
this is a war of conquest and extermination of arabs .
some parisian newspapers even wrote that we 're the barbarians .
algeria is and must remain a french province .
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republican and pro-arab .
after having conquered this land in the name of france , you will now farm it . and make it your new home !
can 't the cross and the crescent get along ?
they have different customs and values .
they 're savages !
you 'll all be shot !
you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you write for this rag ?
you sound like those colonialists i keep meeting here in algiers !
it 's easy to be pro-arab when you live in paris .
i never betrayed you .
no one must ever know .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
i couldn 't show my happiness .
i hope we won 't regret raising this child as ours .
why would we ?
my son aissa looked so much like naouel , whom i had loved so much .
what was in store for him ?
l 'algerie des chimeres a dream of algeria 3 .
the arab kingdom
you 're so handsome and strong , my son .
you 're the one who 's beautiful , mom .
- you are .
- no .
i 'm old now .
your father doesn 't look at me anymore .
- he took a new wife . very young .
- another one ?
since you joined the french , he took 2 wives to sire children .
i 'm not a good mare .
i only had one son .
you .
i think polygamy is barbaric .
you sound like a frenchman .
it 's the " kaida . " the prophet had 9 wives .
- what 's the new wife 's name ?
- she 's from a noble clan .
she is jealous of me .
wanted me sent to the kitchen .
no way !
you 're coming to algiers , to stay with me .
no !
be reassured , son .
your father respects and protects me .
besides , i don 't want to be a burden on you .
it 's time for you to get married .
i chose a nice girl for you from a good family . very pretty and sweet .
sixteen . nice hips , not like me .
she 'll give you beautiful kids .
- no .
- you don 't want to get married ?
your brothers are already engaged , but your father won 't let them marry because you 're the eldest .
i want to choose my own wife .
you love someone else .
yes .
a french woman ?
yes .
- who is she ?
- i can 't tell you .
not even to your mother ?
i don 't know if her parents will allow it .
- it 's because you 're an arab .
- no .
it 's more complicated .
no , it isn 't .
be careful aissa .
the french are hypocrites .
they 're against polygamy , but they all have mistresses .
they won 't give you their daughter .
love can break all barriers .
you 're young .
time erases all ... even love .
your old mother ... knows .
abdallah seems to be managing well .
i 'm not used to it anymore .
you can study here .
i slowly built up a nice library .
i even found manuscripts that belonged to emir abdelkader .
may god protect him in exile .
france stole you from us , aissa .
you forgot that you gave me to france .
it made me into an officer .
it 's like a mother to me .
there are 2 france , aissa .
that 's what i learned .
in paris , france made you an officer and freed italy . here , france keeps algeria under its yoke .
the governor is seizing our land to give to the colonists .
what do they want ?
herd us in the sahara ?
i 'm certain napoleon iii is against confinement .
five tribal elders and i are to meet him in compiegne .
we 'll see if he 's on our side .
- we must trust him .
- may god hear you ... and inspire him truth and justice .
aissa was back .
what joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence , now a grown man covered in glory under the french banner .
- at magenta and solferino ?
- yes .
- you lucky devil . - emile .
war is no joke , except for kings and emperors . victory in solferino cost thousands of lives .
yes , but we saved the italians from austrian occupation .
what a beautiful uniform .
you look handsome .
- dinner is ready .
- let 's go .
tell us all about it .
to aissa .
i looked at aissa .
he was proof that one could be a good frenchman and a good a muslim .
did he embody the successful union of the east and the west ?
i started to believe in it again .
i don 't like the way aissa looks at jeanne .
- going out ?
with those goo goo eyes of his .
- didn 't you notice ?
- no . why ?
- suppose he 's in love with her .
- what are you talking about ?
i hope we won 't regret raising this child as ours .
on the contrary .
he 's the perfect example of integration .
- he 's like a frenchman .
- perhaps . but he isn 't .
he is by the blood he spilled , fighting for france .
that 's fine , but i don 't want him to touch my daughter .
don 't worry .
he 's staying in town and wants to be his own man .
i hope so .
i have something to tell you , jeanne .
i love war .
i discovered a new homeland :
in the army , barriers fall .
i 'm not a muslim among catholics or an arab among french .
i 'm a soldier among soldiers . all equal before death .
only one rule : courage .
- do you understand ?
- i don 't know . it 's a male world where women have no place .
i 'm bored , aissa .
i need to do something useful , exciting , unique .
sometimes i envy the fate of colonist women .
it 's dangerous but so exciting .
jeanne . will you marry me ?
of course .
when we were little , we said we 'd get married .
will your parents let their daughter marry a muslim ?
i don 't know about dad .
mother won 't .
but i don 't care .
- where is miss jeanne ?
- outside .
how are you feeling ?
well .
why ?
you 've been odd , lately .
you can trust me .
among women , we can understand each other .
nothing is troubling me .
a mother feels such things .
you 're a big girl , jeanne .
it 's time to think about your future .
there 're many young officers from good families in algiers .
i 'll invite some for you to meet .
- i 'm not in a hurry to marry .
- then you 'll be an old maid .
mother !
what are you driving at ?
i don 't want you to fall for just anyone .
that 's all .
- that 's what it is . - yes .
that 's what it is .
you 've changed since aissa 's return .
- you have a soft spot for him .
- not a soft spot .
we 're in love .
we want to get married .
what ?
marry an arab ?
a muslim ?
no way !
marriage is something serious .
you marry someone with the same religion and background .
i forbid you to see this boy .
understood ?
i forbid you .
understood ?
yes .
- i knew it .
i told you . - thank you .
and you thought they were like brother and sister .
i 'll call the police if he sets foot in here again .
what 's gotten into you ?
we raised him as one or ours .
unfortunately , yes .
anyway you always had a soft spot for him .
- i don 't want him to touch her .
he won 't have the chance anyway .
his regiment is leaving for france , then mexico .
- when ?
- i don 't know .
the emperor wants maximilian of austria in mexico .
very good .
how can you say that .
it 's war over there .
just as well .
maybe he 'll get killed .
is jeanne there ?
get out !
beat it !
never set foot in this house !
go away !
- you had no right to stop him .
- you do what you 're told .
you can 't stop me .
i 'll leave , come what may .
i 'll join him , become a muslim if need be .
- go to your room !
- don 't touch me !
don 't you ever , again .
- what are you doing here ?
- i escaped from home .
- are you out of your mind ?
- i came to say goodbye .
- what are you doing ?
- i want to be yours .
i can 't believe it !
look at this !
see the news ?
your circumcised pal is taking 5 elders to see the emperor .
- did you know ?
- no .
- we 're not close anymore .
- they are plotting in compiegne , with general fleury and the saint-simonians .
- what do they want ?
- arabize us .
said , come with me .
take care of yourself !
don 't worry .
this trip is very important for me .
the emperor has decided .
he read my books .
he plans a new algeria policy , my policy .
can you understand that ?
- you 'll see the kids at least . - of course .
i 'll write every day and tell you what 's happening .
" dear bahia , you can 't imagine how lavishly
" the emperor received our arab friends at compiegne . "
" everything is so wonderful .
" the emperor held long talks with the elders .
" he promised complete equality between europeans and arabs .
" ' that 's but fair , honorable and right , ' he told them . " who were delighted , you can imagine .
" it 's truly a revolution . "
" the native chiefs gave the emperor a black stallion , " a magnificent offspring of the famous godolphin arabian , " father of all thoroughbreds .
" his majesty has a special place for it .
" ' we 'll be able to compete with the british , ' gen. fleury said .
" her majesty the empress and the imperial prince " showed our friends consideration and appreciation .
" the emperor recognized aissa , whom he decorated at magenta . " he also introduced him to the empress .
" his father , hadj hamou , was filled with pride .
" finally , his majesty did me the honor
" to explain in detail his project to our friends " to turn algeria into an arab kingdom . "
dear friends , here 's the man whose works have inspired the emperor 's policy .
no one can better explain it to you .
i 'll give him the floor .
the emperor asked me to tell you that we didn 't come to algeria to oppress or plunder , but to bring you the blessings of civilization .
he wants to make algeria an arab kingdom .
henceforth , he 'll protect you , as he does the french .
he is both emperor of the french and king of the arabs .
- in practice , what does it mean ?
- firstly ... the emperor will end the confinement policy .
your title to traditional tribal lands will be recognized .
no more despoliation .
- will land be ours ?
- it will belong to the tribes .
later , everyone will have a share .
secondly ... following the proclamation of full european-arab equality , the emperor shall grant french citizenship to jews and arabs who so desire .
we know france brings progress and we are grateful .
but we 'd rather live according to our own laws and customs .
for us muslims , religion rules everything .
you know that .
the koran is our civil code , our book of science and medicine , the word of god .
i assure you , all your views will be taken into account .
let us begin .
what 's your impression ?
they are delighted by their stay .
they were also charmed by his majesty .
i think they 'll agree with the arab kingdom model , except for si kadour , my father-in-law .
we have to handle him carefully .
he 's very influential in kabylia .
in any event , it 's imperative for his majesty to come to algeria to launch his policy .
it will provoke colonist and military opposition .
he 'll come .
it 's only a question of timing .
if pelissier doesn 't like it , we 'll replace him .
there you are .
talabot has been waiting for you for half an hour .
- paulin , i 'm happy to see you .
- odilon .
- what are you doing in algiers ?
- big news , old pal .
next week , we 'll be laying down the last railroad track . we 're also inaugurating the new blida station .
marshal pelissier ...
everyone will be there .
i hope you 'll write a nice article .
is the paper yours ?
i bought 50 % from roucaries , but it 's not doing well .
no .
i have to meet pelissier .
i gave roucaries all the details .
- see you later at the cafe .
- agreed .
is mr. talabot a saint-simonian ?
i heard you were too .
does this sect still exist ?
they 're scattered , but still have influence at the court , among university students and bankers .
here 's the article . lately , they 've become like the freemasons .
what do they want ?
the utopians like toussaint believe in santa claus .
the others believe in progress , thinking that with money , factories , mines and railroads , they can solve everything .
the paradox is that they began as socialists , and now they 're big capitalists .
i saw helie yesterday .
we spoke about you and old times .
it seems you had a falling out ?
we have nothing to say to each other .
he 's gen. fleury 's man . he heads the pro-arab camp that wants to sell out algeria .
we disagree about the future of this country .
you 're both wrong .
helie thinks that the french and arabs can live as equals .
you want to turn them into frenchmen .
that 's an illusion .
and you ?
what 's your solution ? i ... build .
i build railroads and roads , dig the ground , plant trees .
i represent progress , a sort of charity .
i deal with reality , not dreams .
do you know what arabs say about your railroad ?
" al-rabat sheitan , " the devil 's cart .
i 'm hungry .
let 's have lunch .
good piece , benjamin !
you 'll do the next on the army 's anti-confinement action .
- look !
nice layout .
- yes .
boy , come here .
it 's time i tell him .
i have bad news .
- i can guess .
- i can 't pay you .
you haven 't paid him in 2 months .
it 's not my fault if we don 't have money .
half the colonists are spanish and can 't read french .
- i got an idea .
- really ?
struck gold ?
- maybe .
- serious ?
- where ?
- here in algiers . - what is it ?
- my dad 's pockets .
we 're always ready to help our french friends .
from the start of conquest we offered france our services .
we know the turks and arabs well , mr. hubert .
we 've dealt with them for 2 centuries , since my ancestors came from leghorn to trade between barbary coast pirates and italian merchants .
please , sit down .
we know your father advises gen. bugeaud on arab affairs .
benjamin told me about your paper 's financial difficulties .
that shouldn 't be a problem . my eldest son david , who runs our bank , can help you .
did you hear me ?
with a special rate for friends .
thank you very much . let me also say how much we appreciate benjamin 's intelligence , skills and talents .
yes , benjamin .
i sent him to law school in montpellier . it cost a bundle , but we wanted him to be our lawyer .
but in france , he caught the political bug .
politics seals the fate of nations .
it 's very important .
trade is safer .
business is business , whoever is in power .
since your paper deals with politics , i 've a favor to ask .
please , tell me .
as head of the jewish council , i 'm host to a french member of parliament who is concerned about our small community . his name is adolphe cremieux .
i hope he gets french citizenship for algerian jews .
i thought you weren 't interested in politics .
it 's , let 's say , about religion .
we 'll be glad to interview him .
tell him to come to the paper .
thank you .
actually , thank you for what you 're doing for the paper .
it 's for a good cause , that of a french algeria where jews will play an important role .
since that is the case , could you arrange a meeting between myself as head of the jewish council , and the governor-general ?
the army and i aren 't ...
you can see to it with my son daniel .
perhaps .
- see you tomorrow ... 8 am ?
- yes .
bahia ?
- had a good trip ?
- a bit long .
- i missed you .
- you too . - come !
- you 're still as beautiful .
tell me about the kids .
they 're well .
they send their love and miss you .
ahmed got his ph.d. in law with honors .
good !
now he can practice in algiers .
- i 'm not sure he wants to .
- you 'll get upset .
- tell me !
he thinks he won 't make it in algiers .
he 's decided to stay in paris and changed his name .
- he now calls himself amedee .
- my son ahmed ?
don 't be upset !
i don 't like it , but i can understand him .
in paris , an arab name sticks out like a turban .
many jews and poles took french names .
he won 't be the first .
then , why aren 't french taking arab names here ?
it 's a religious thing .
the french take saints ' names .
- i won 't have it .
- bahia !
i 'll write him what i think .
calm down .
things will change .
ahmed might too .
the emperor accepted our proposals .
algeria will be an arab kingdom with equal citizens .
it will be a tough sell .
everyone is against you .
- you must be hungry .
- a bit .
marshal pelissier will see you .
- some port as you wait ?
- no , thanks .
i don 't drink .
a cigar ?
i don 't smoke .
besides , it 's ramadan .
sorry !
i forgot .
the governor is in a foul mood .
he got orders from paris , he doesn 't like .
i think i know what they are .
so you 're here .
did you put all this nonsense in his majesty 's head ?
my respects , marshal .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
don 't be so coy !
this letter of instructions from his majesty ,
which he personally signed .
it talks about the end of the confinement policy , about the arab kingdom ,
and arab-european equality .
did you put him up to it ?
it 's full of your books ' subversive language ... and that of your friends , fleury , david ...
you flatter me thinking i have such influence on his majesty .
no doubletalk .
hear this , little fellow !
i was on the beach when we landed .
i didn 't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the arabs who 'll mess it up .
i won 't ever accept that !
do you hear me ?
ever !
may i remind you , sir . the country belongs to the arabs .
no more .
we took it with our blood .
and especially with theirs .
listen , toussaint !
we aren 't dreamers , visionaries .
we build .
we 're turning algeria into a modern country bringing comfort to the colonists and progress to the natives .
there is no other viable plan .
all else is idle talk for frustrated intellectuals a bit like you .
you won 't build anything without the algerians .
toussaint ...
you might be the smartest , but i warn you ... i shall stop you .
god be my witness ! i 'm the strongest .
i too have connections in the court .
perhaps you forget that my wife is the empress ' cousin .
- may i go , marshal ?
- get out !
and don 't get in my way or you 'll regret it .
my respects , marshal .
what arrogance !
i asked the emperor to remove this good-for-nothing .
he 's general fleury 's man and he 's backed by the emperor .
by jove , we 'll see who 's the strongest .
keep your smooth talk for paris .
when we came here , there was nothing but desert , swamps , flies and dwarf palms .
one third of us died of cholera .
one third gave up and rented the land to the arabs .
we are the last third .
we survived massacres , disease , drought , grasshoppers .
we won 't give in to your arab kingdom .
listen ! why end confinement ?
algeria has 3.5 million people . it can feed 20 .
we have 12 million hectares of uncultivated land . and you want to stop colonization .
thousands of colonists can come .
why leave good land to the arabs ?
either their herds destroy it , or they badly farm it .
- we produce 6 times they do .
- he 's right .
it 's our land .
we created a new france here .
friends , the land belongs to the natives , the colonists and the army .
the emperor declared it an arab kingdom , a european colony and a military camp .
arrant nonsense .
it 's crystal clear to me .
first , we 're not your friends , toussaint . ruling means choosing .
it 's either us or them .
tell your emperor that no one will throw us out .
this is our home .
our enemies want to give power to the arabs .
if they win , that 'll toll the bell for us .
- do you want to become arab ?
we 'll remain french . we won 't bow to napoleon the puny ... king of the arabs !
we are now 200,000 europeans .
we can 't be dismissed .
we 've rallied the colonists , and all true republicans :
printers , masons , merchants , and architects .
- are the jews with us ?
- of course . they might not dare come out , but i 'm here .
we 'll mobilize the women and demonstrate with you .
down with the emperor !
long live the republic !
we had a feverish month .
algiers was under siege . every day , people heard our call . women too .
- french algeria !
french algeria ! - present arms !
get ready !
let us through .
we 're going to the government house .
- the street is closed .
- let us through !
aim !
- forward !
- french algeria !
take it easy !
i 'm not unhappy about the protests .
they show paris the futility of its abandonment policy .
even women are getting into the act .
that 's too much .
these people are hotheads a bit quick-tempered , but they cool down as quickly .
don 't forget !
we 're south of marseille .
anyway , make sure the troops aren 't trigger-happy .
break some skulls if you must , but no fire .
that 's an order .
i don 't want any violence .
understood ?
no more violence .
it cooled down after a month .
mar. pelissier died from pneumonia . the arab kingdom policy had its first setback .
neither jews nor arabs wanted to give up their special status in exchange for french citizenship .
only 200 arabs out of 3 million applied for it . aissa was one of them and had his own reasons .
- thanks but i don 't drink .
- of course .
i came to ask you for jeanne 's hand , officially .
my regiment leaves for mexico and we would like to be engaged before i leave .
aissa . you and jeanne cannot marry .
why ?
you 're too young , practically brother and sister .
a kabyle proverb says , " marry within your tribe ,
" within your village , and if possible , within your family . "
you belong to different worlds .
what ?
i 'm french now .
yes , but you 're also muslim .
do you know the obstacles you 'll be facing ?
jeanne will want a church wedding .
what will your family say ?
- there 're other mixed couples .
- they 're the exception .
your friend helie toussaint married a muslim woman .
yes , but he converted , and now stands disowned by his family .
listen !
let 's not beat around the bush . is it yes or no ?
aissa . i 'd like to say yes but it 's impossible .
believe me .
trust me .
it 's no , then .
what if we eloped without your permission ?
i forbid you .
i get it .
my arab blood was acceptable on the battlefield .
in paris , they saw fit to grant me french citizenship .
but they forgot to tell me it was a second class passport , because here in algiers , i 'm always an outsider , a native .
even for you .
it 's all clear now .
i 'll wait for you .
when you return , i 'll be of age .
i 'll leave home .
we 'll marry and live in france .
we still have to wait .
i 'll wait for as long as it takes .
napoleon iii came to algeria twice to proclaim himself king of the arabs .
he was delighted .
he ate ostrich eggs , roasted gazelle and lion meat .
everywhere , huge arab crowds cheered him .
our paper had to concede his great success , organized , it must be said , by the arab office .
helie acted as his interpreter throughout his stay .
it was his hour of glory .
he thought he 'd seen the dawn of the arab kingdom . history decided otherwise .
look at this !
four years of drought , famine , cholera , and grasshoppers .
all at once in just 4 years .
look !
they 're eating grass , roots and even leaves .
people are dropping like flies from hunger and cholera .
where are the french doctors ?
cholera isn 't racist . frenchmen have died from it too .
even bugeaud died from it in paris .
did you see how the peasant treated me ?
when you privatized collective land , you broke up the tribe ,
it 's the price of progress and of a fairer , modern society .
do you know what they did with the arid land you gave them ?
they sold it to the colonists for a pittance .
people here are superstitious .
they 're saying the arab kingdom has the evil eye .
i 'm sorry , but all you 've done for us is turning against us .
all the same , you can 't blame us for drought , grasshoppers , and disease .
bad luck hounds us .
people say it 's god 's vengeance because we didn 't defend our land against the infidels .
tell the governor that if france does nothing , there 'll be war .
- warn him .
- i will .
tell him that i lost a son ... to cholera , and that my youngest might go into the mountains .
- you know what that means ?
- how is she ?
- it 's cholera .
quick . she 's being waiting for you for 2 days .
my son ... apple of my eye .
- you came to say farewell .
- i 'm here .
you 'll pull through .
it 's too late .
god picks the hour and mine has come .
i 've a secret to tell you .
a secret ?
yes , aissa . one that i 've carried in my heart since you were born .
odilon is your father .
you mustn 't marry jeanne .
forgive me , aissa !
i mixed infidel blood ... with that of the true warriors of the faith .
i was young , a harem slave .
during the tafna peace ,
odilon was abdelkader 's doctor .
you were born after that .
hadj hamou raised you . he taught you to walk , to ride a horse , and to use a sword and rifle .
he taught you right from wrong , and courage .
he taught you the true religion .
he 's your father too .
stay with me !
stay !
i had made a promise .
i will always be fond of jeanne .
promise me never to tell her .
i promise .
if it does , i 'll fight by your side .
you can 't , aissa .
that 'd give you away .
have you forsaken your religion ?
i haven 't .
one day , france will allow its citizens to be catholic , jewish or muslim .
france ... maybe .
but we won 't here , son , not on muslim soil .
you 're french now .
you must leave and fulfill your destiny .
i am french .
but my heart will forever be in algeria .
you 're hiding something .
what 's going on ?
is it another woman ?
is that it ?
be honest .
i 'm getting married .
what ?
my mother has chosen my future wife .
i cannot refuse .
it 's tradition , you see .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't care .
what 'll you do , all alone in paris ?
where will you stay ?
with aunt ines .
i 'll take a job as a nurse .
i 'll treat the wounded on the front .
i 'll defend france .
you 're lying .
you want to go with him .
you want to be with your arab !
throwing yourself at him like that !
how dare you ?
look at yourself .
a kabyle raped your grandmother !
you 're an arab too !
the bad arabs like raping women like you !
jeanne ...
our armies are getting defeated everywhere :
wissembourg , reichshoffen-froeschwiller ...
what a disgrace !
what possessed the emperor to wage war on prussia ?
bismarck was waiting for it .
new headline !
the emperor was captured and abdicated .
gambetta declared a new republic .
a new republic , my friends !
follow me !
said ? i couldn 't believe it .
the emperor had been captured .
they 'd declared a new republic .
my old dream had finally come true !
i 'm the lieutenant commander !
you should leave before my friends get here .
listen to them . they 're jubilant .
don 't be a hero , it 's best you flee .
where 's toussaint ?
where 's that sly fox ?
vanished .
we 'll get him sooner or later .
while the french are fighting each other ,
- let 's throw them into the sea .
we must save the arab kingdom .
they say they 're republicans , but you know them .
they 're colonialists , arabophobes ...
let 's rouse the tribes and drive the french out !
- cowards !
- listen to me !
we 've talked enough .
i 'll rouse my troops and fight !
come with me to oran , bahia .
you can 't stay in algiers .
bahia ...
i beg you ...
do this for me .
