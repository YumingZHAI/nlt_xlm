the producers ?
i think she thinks that i could 've been trying to scare her , play a sick joke on her .
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person .
for all i know , johnny took it .
( carolina ) johnny took it ?
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
i don 't know .
( carolina ) oh , now johnny does everything ?
not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
hopefully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here .
i don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
why are you always defending him ?
why are you always defending him ?
i 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
you need to watch yourself !
i 'm kind of baffled where it 's gone , you know , ' cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
it would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
it 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
got some traps set up along this way somewhere .
i found some deer trails i scouted earlier .
hope they catch something .
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome , actually .
had a nice little fire .
weather was nice .
you know , wrapped up .
it was nice being on my own .
it 's what i wanted to do originally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and i got that , so pretty content .
what the hell did this , man ?
this thing 's ...
i mean , it , obviously , it ripped the deer while it was standing here .
it was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
( crack )
what do you want ?
what are you doing ?
( johnny ) i 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
what do you want ?
i just came to try to convince you to come back .
( johnny ) try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
yeah , i don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
i think it 's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accusations .
just , whatever happened , i don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here .
well , you know what ?
i really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
i 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
i can take care of myself .
y 'all try taking care of yourselves , too , all right ?
( carolina ) okay , fine .
if that 's how you want to be , then fine .
( johnny ) fine .
nah , that 's-- that 's not good enough .
that ain 't good enough .
( daniel ) hey , irene .
hey , dan .
whatcha doing ?
collecting some acorns .
- oh .
- yeah .
if you mash them up , you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it .
- really ?
- yeah .
is it-- does it taste good ?
i think so .
you want me to help ?
oh , sure .
that 'd be great . yeah .
they 're kind of scattered all over .
daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit ,
i guess you can say .
hey .
it 's a siberian squill .
( irene ) i 'm not really big on flowers .
why not ?
well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower ' cause it 's like , " oh , you know , i like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
it never really made sense to me .
( chuckles )
something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
( daniel ) she 's got so much complexity to her , you know ?
i find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that i would 've never expected out of her .
it 's ... ( chuckles )
she 's just-- she 's amazing .
( both chuckle )
where are we ?
i can 't find the path .
we 're lost .
- we 're not lost .
- no , we 're lost .
i don 't know where we 're going .
( miljan ) in the middle of the wood , very close to the river ,
i found this really weird-looking tree .
i mean , it wasn 't a tree .
it was something different .
it had a face shape .
it had hair .
what ?
my name is miljan .
it 's really nice to meet you . ( chuckles )
what is your name ?
ogdee ?
( laughs )
this is my friend ogdee .
we go way back , man .
( laughs )
he 's so bad .
i spoke to it .
we had a little conversation .
ogdee is my old friend from high school .
( laughs )
i 'm kidding .
- ( man ) esther .
esther .
- what ?
( esther ) hey .
where have you been ?
out .
out ?
where do you go all day , anyway ?
( whispering ) okay .
i can 't believe you got us so lost .
we 're not lost .
yes , we are .
where are we ?
do you know where we are ?
we 're in siberia .
not funny .
oh , god !
what is that ?
did you hear that ?
i heard it .
come on .
there might be something out here .
come on .
oh !
oh , god !
what are you doing out here ?
sorry .
i 'm going to get water .
where are you going ?
home-- where the hell is it ?
that way .
why is she being such a bitch ?
why are you here , by the way , alone ?
no reason .
uh-huh .
that 's suspicious .
( annie ) shut up , miljan .
( chuckles )
( neeko ) guys , have you seen carolina ?
( sam ) no .
she hasn 't come back .
you mean she 's not back yet ?
she 's not back .
i have no idea where she is .
i haven 't seen her .
you do know she 's out there with johnny ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i know .
well , i don 't know about you , but i feel like i should go and look for her .
i don 't-- i don 't feel comfortable with her with johnny .
( sam ) before it gets too late , i think we should .
i 'm game , yeah .
( neeko ) - you 're gonna come with me ?
- yeah .
( miljan ) gentlemen .
where the hell were you ?
i was in the woods .
have you seen carolina ?
( neeko ) she 's out there with johnny .
( miljan ) oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- come on .
- are you serious ?
( miljan ) yes .
they 're probably having sex or something .
oh , you 're a funny guy .
don 't be naive . you didn 't notice the chemistry they had ?
( neeko ) hey , guys , listen .
i 'm gonna look for her .
i don 't know about you .
just sitting here talking .
( miljan ) hey , it 's dark outside .
( rumbling )
oh , fuck !
( neeko ) get on the bed .
get onto the bed !
the bed ?
( miljan ) oh , my god .
what is this ?
the cab started shaking ...
ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that i 've never seen in my life , and i 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
what is it ?
it 's like-- it 's like the sky 's on fire .
what ?
it 's like the sky 's on fire .
( daniel ) the sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like victoria said .
if this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
i don 't understand how they could pull it off .
( sam ) i feel like i 'm on another planet .
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and nobody-- nobody has any answers .
i don 't have an answer .
i could sit here all day long and just-- it 's way above my pay scale .
- is it moving ?
- it just keeps moving .
carolina never came back today , did she ?
( woman ) yeah .
where-- where are they ?
( miljan ) she 's still in the woods-- the forest .
well , this can 't stop us .
we still have to find her .
we can 't leave her out there .
we better go now .
we 're just gonna go look for her-- me and sam , daniel , miljan as well .
oh , my god .
carolina ?
carolina .
are you okay ?
( indistinct shouting )
( woman ) what happened ?
oh , my god .
carolina !
- what happened ?
are you okay ?
- are you okay ?
then we see carolina stumbling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rushing over to her .
are you hurt somewhere ?
- ( sam ) what happened ?
- ( woman ) look at all the blood .
what happened ?
she 's bleeding .
guys , don 't , don 't-- don 't go to her .
oh , my god , look at her arm .
look at her arm .
( sam ) what happened to you ?
you 're okay .
( neeko ) carolina , what happened ?
( daniel ) carolina shows up , and she 's battered and disoriented .
she couldn 't even speak .
she 's trembling .
( carolina ) i don 't ...
she doesn 't remember .
- ( woman ) you don 't remember ? - ( carolina cries )
( sam ) what do you remember ?
( natalie ) she didn 't know what was going on .
she was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
she was just talking nonsense , and it was really jolting to see her come back like that .
_
( woman ) you were with john ?
- ( sam ) and what happened ?
- ( woman ) where is he ?
what were you doing with johnny ?
get her some water .
get her some help .
( neeko ) carolina , were you with johnny ?
( sam ) she said she was .
what were you doing with johnny ?
( neeko ) she said the name " johnny . "
at that point , i just , you know , lost it .
listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
( neeko ) for what ?
here , just come here .
come here .
i want to say something to you .
- what ?
- listen to me !
it 's important .
you got to make sure .
you look at his hands .
( neeko ) okay .
his hands are a tell-tale sign , okay ?
his hands will tell you if he did something .
( daniel ) what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
stay here with the girls .
stay here with the girls !
( neeko ) i 'm not wasting any more time with this guy .
everyone wants to keep him around , thinking ,
" oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
no , i don 't think so .
i 'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- she 's been through a lot .
- yeah .
we 're gonna look after you , okay ?
don 't worry .
( esther ) we don 't know where johnny is .
carolina sort of-- she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and johnny were fighting .
and then , now she looks like this , so johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because sam and neeko went after him .
let 's just keep moving .
( rustling )
move .
move .
_
( rustling continues )
the whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that , you know--
we stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
it 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
i haven 't slept very well , you know .
so i 'm just-- you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
you always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
i don 't know .
( animal screeches )
well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
( rustling )
yes .
you keep saying " he , " " he . "
look how thick the brush is here .
if there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
we hear other things .
all of a sudden , something goes flying .
i think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
i 'll go see if the water 's boiled .
thank you .
( natalie ) i don 't want to die .
i didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show , and every day that i 'm here ,
i feel like i 'm an idiot for staying , that i am gonna end up like tommy .
( cries )
i don 't deal well with-- abuse is not something that ...
i can handle right now .
i 'm scared .
( daniel ) and johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food .
i just-- how could he do that to her ?
it didn 't make sense .
she 's such a nice lady .
( footsteps )
johnny .
hey .
what did you do ?
- huh ?
- what did you do to carolina ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
what do you mean you don 't know what i 'm talking about ?
- what 'd you do to her ?
- i didn 't--
she 's all cut up and shit .
i don 't-
- i don 't know .
i ...
what 's wrong with you ?
i don 't know . i just-
- i kind of came to .
i was walking around , and ...
i don 't know .
i was- - i saw her .
you saw her where ?
you got to tell me what happened .
we were in the woods , and ...
i don 't really-- i don 't really remember .
i get approached by daniel , and basically started accusing me of hurting carolina .
i didn 't know what to say .
( natalie ) what did you to do her ? !
the last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
i don 't .
( natalie ) then what happened to her ?
i don 't know .
that 's not a very good answer right now , man .
i don 't-- trust me .
that 's not a very good answer .
( indistinct shouting in distance )
hey .
you hear that ?
at the camp .
let 's go .
i don 't know .
are you serious ?
you don 't know ?
you 're such a scumbag .
oh , what ?
so she just fell down and ended up that way ?
are you kidding me ?
i was in a complete haze .
i had no recollection .
i was like blacked out , like i drank too much .
( daniel ) he doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on .
( johnny ) i don 't .
- then what happened to her ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
i don 't know .
( woman ) you were together , weren 't you ?
- you said that .
- shit !
neeko !
neeko !
( indistinct shouting )
( daniel ) guys , he doesn 't know !
( neeko )
- motherfucker !
( daniel )
- come on !
stop it !
- ( carolina ) stop !
stop it !
- ( neeko ) come on !
stop it !
neeko , stop it !
he didn 't do it !
carolina starts screaming , " it 's not him .
he didn 't do it . "
stop it !
what do you mean ?
you said you don 't remember .
you said you don 't remember .
( neeko ) you 're a dead man .
you 're a fucking dead man .
( daniel ) listen .
listen .
hey , hey .
hey !
calm down .
listen .
- what happened ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
talk to me .
i don 't know .
johnny doesn 't know anything ?
he doesn 't remember anything .
it was just her and him in the forest .
i know that .
i know that .
i saw it in his eyes , okay ?
all i remember is i talked to her .
we were arguing .
and then i-i came here , and i started getting accused , and i don 't even know what the fuck is going on .
( sam ) if we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
when i saw that look in his eyes ,
i just felt that i needed to take a step back .
remember the way she came into camp ?
he 's got the same look on his face .
( johnny ) does she remember anything ?
( woman ) show us your hands .
( woman ) ( gasps )
( natalie ) oh , yeah .
i 've seen that before .
( woman ) what 's that from ?
( sam ) nothing 's making sense here .
and just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
we can 't go killing each other .
we 're still human beings .
( hiss )
( talking indistinctly )
( birds chirping )
i don 't like things that i can 't explain and that i don 't have at least some sort of control over .
the sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers , the show can 't do that .
we 're talking supernatural stuff now .
regardless of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
( johnny ) it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her .
i 've never hit a woman in my life .
i don 't know why i would .
i don 't remember anything , but ...
i can 't say that i didn 't ' cause i don 't--
i don 't know what happened .
but i know in my heart i wouldn 't do that .
( carolina ) i don 't remember anything .
all i remember is that i was ... with--
went to get johnny .
he was in the woods .
i found him , and i ...
it 's all one big blur , like one big blackout .
i have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and i don 't remember .
i don 't understand .
so you 're telling me this is real .
( sabina ) yes .
it looks like it 's native , handmade .
it looks like it 's just a prop to me .
well , if it 's a prop , it 's really well-made ' cause you see the barbs .
they 're curved .
that 's exactly how it should look .
this is ox .
it 's real ox .
and it 's balanced for throwing .
it just looks perfect .
it 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
i don 't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true , what is not .
i have to know the environment i 'm in .
i have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
look at this .
so , i found this symbol that is really strange .
it has four lines and little triangles on the ends .
then i found another one and another one , and i realized it 's a path .
i should follow them .
at the end , it was very close to the settlement .
i found the last one .
and i found this box .
it was a metal box .
i opened it , and it was a book .
i didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
i would assume it 's russian because it 's cyrillic letters .
( miljan ) in the middle of me looking at it , somebody was watching at me .
it was a person .
he 's staring at me .
and he just disappeared in a second .
so there are people out there .
hey .
i was just gonna try and make things better , and , like , apologize , and just wanted to let her know that i didn 't , you know ,
i didn 't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her .
i guess i was in a weird mood , and i just want to apologize because i don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because i 'm really glad you 're--
( natalie ) when i realized what annie 's real feelings were for me ,
i just thought ...
" i 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
so i kissed her .
( chuckles )
which i kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
( laughs )
don 't worry about it .
hey .
hey .
can i have a seat ?
how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
you ?
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing ' cause i knew she had scratches and stuff on her , and she was sure freaked out like i was .
( carolina ) do you remember anything from last night ?
no .
i don 't remember a thing .
i don 't remember anything either .
but i know you didn 't hurt me .
i would never hurt you .

( johnny ) can i ask you something , though ?
why 'd you set me up ?
with the shed and the food ?
she couldn 't even look me in the eye .
and i was like , " well ... "
i was like , " it tells me all i need to know , "
so i was like-- got the hell out of there .
johnny .
johnny .
( spanish ) stop , please .
johnny , wait for me .
- give me a break . ( spanish ) oh , my god . - ( daniel ) hey .
i know that .
i know that .
- johnny .
- i know that .
you 're an actress .
she said , like , this slogan .
like , " i know that .
i know that from somewhere . "
and then it just-- the light bulb went off .
yeah , that 's like your slogan .
she 's that actress from that show that--
i 'm like , " that 's how i know you . "
i didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't want-
- i asked them .
you didn 't want to do what ?
i didn 't want to burn it down .
i didn 't want to set you up .
they told me to .
who 's they ?
the producers .
so you 're-- you 're helping the show ?
- mom , may i please go to the toilet ?
david !
it 's me .
olivier ! what are you doing here ?
you thought you were going to america without me ?
you 're coming with us ?
wow ! i 'm so happy !
- but how can we do it ?
- don 't worry , i planned everything .
i have my health card .
i even pinched some money from jean and elodie ... for the train .
see , i still have some left .
you can 't pay the boat fare with that .
i 'll try to get hired as a cabin boy , or a dishwasher .
or hide with you as a stowaway .
i saw that in a movie .
i 'll feed you .
in america , samuel will help me cross the border .
now that you 're an orphan , my parents could adopt you .
oh yeah !
that would be swell .
we 'd be brothers !
come on .
let 's go see my parents .
wouldn 't it be better to meet on the boat ?
but no . they 'll be really happy to see you .
they were awfully worried .
isaac !
olivier !
what are you doing here ?
is elodie with you ?
no . she doesn 't know i 'm coming with you .
coming with us ?
now what is this all about ?
we could take him to america .
but these children are utterly out of their minds !
olivier , we would gladly take you if we could , but we 're not your parents .
we can adopt him !
david , look .
we can 't just adopt someone .
and then , olivier has a family , an aunt who has the means to give him a good education .
i don 't want to go to aunt victoria 's .
she 's a cow ! listen .
once we get to havre , i 'll call elodie .
i 'll buy a ticket for your return , and she 'll come ... pick you up at the saint-lazare station .
i can 't !
i pinched money from her to take the train .
no .
it 's okay .
i will explain ... and she 'll understand .
if he can 't come with us , then i 'm staying with him .
isaac , tell them it 's not possible !
listen , olivier ...
we understand your sorrow but please , be reasonable .
no . it 's not true .
you understand nothing !
you only think of yourself !
no , olivier .
olivier , wait for me !
i 'm coming with you !
david , come back !
hurry david , hurry up !
children , come back !
ouch !
my leg !
- i got one . - olivier !
it wasn 't my son who pulled the alarm .
it was a friend who wanted to come with us .
he 's all alone . you must find him !
- come here , david .
- i 'll see what i can do .
i don 't want to go with you .
david !
come back , kid .
what happened ?
a kid pulled the alarm .
he ran away .
you should put a flare on the track for the next train .
we don 't have time .
olivier !
olivier !
olivier !
david !
david !
david .
- where are you 're going , boy ?
paris ?
that 's pretty far off !
i had planned to take the train .
i 'm going to paris as well . i 'll take you .
besides , i don 't like traveling alone , so we 'll be doing each other a favor .
agreed ?
anyone in the back ?
no . i 'm going back empty .
- so , okay .
- where in paris do you live ?
i 'm not from paris , i 'm from the hill .
a real urchin , hey .
your parents just let you go ?
yeah .
my parents are really cool .
they trust me .
okay .
get in .
- so ?
- so .... so ...
zilch .
nothing .
the police have issued an apb .
zober was the last to see him .
since then , not a trace .
and that 's not all !
they want to fine him for pulling the alarm .
and for the money he 's stolen ?
- did you tell them ?
- no .
i 'm waiting for them to find him .
i hope he didn 't do anything stupid .
him ? what do you think !
just wait . he 'll get what 's coming to him .
i want him out of here .
he 's a sack of shit !
- listen .
- i don 't want to hear it !
i 'll kick his ass straight to the reformatory !
anybody here ?
what is it ?
what do you want , lad ?
i 'd like to talk to mr. privat .
he should be here .
no . he 's at home now , in auvergne .
can i call him ?
my mother often called him from here .
so you are the son of mrs. chateauneuf ?
everyone is looking for you , even the police .
- i beg you .
i must talk to him .
it 's important .
i 'll call .
good evening , miss .
could you ring number 3 at saugues , please .
it 's in haute-loire .
you won 't tell the cops , eh ?
hello ?
mr. privat ?
excuse me . this is hotel du cantal .
i have mrs. chateauneuf 's son here .
he wants to talk to you .
i 'll put him on .
hello .
mr. privat ?
yes , this is olivier .
you must help me . i did something stupid .
i ran away and stole money from elodie .
i 'm really scared .
yes .
yes , okay .
thank you .
i 'll put him on .
hello , mr. privat ?
yes .
good .
see you tomorrow morning .
come with me .
you 'll sleep here .
olivier !
olivier !
hello !
wake up .
- good morning .
- good morning , sir .
this breakfast should give you a boost .
thank you .
but first ... i must tell you what happened .
don 't worry .
i know all about it .
everything 's been sorted out .
i 've already been to the police station and have spoken to elodie .
she 's waiting for you .
- she 's glad you 're in good health .
- she won 't send me to reform school ?
nothing of the sort .
everyone knows what you 're going through right now .
elodie even has a surprise for you .
come on , eat up .
then we 'll go see her .
okay , sir .
this is so good !
i 'm coming !
olivier , i 'm so glad to see you .
you 're okay ?
- you 're not too tired ?
- no , no .
i 'm fine .
i 'm fine .
elodie ... i wanted to apologize .
for the money and for the scare i 've given you .
you know , we all make mistakes .
it wasn 't too serious .
and we understand you .
without your mom , and also with david 's departure ...
this is why mister privat and we decided to make you a big surprise .
what is it ?
you 'll go with him to saugues .
you 'll see , there you 'll be very , very happy .
you 'll have a big bedroom all to yourself .
you 'll learn to ride a horse .
and then the mountain air , there 's nothing better for a child !
and i don 't live far from your grandparents .
you can see them when you want .
and there 's also a very good school .
your studies will be better there .
what does aunt victoria say ?
she wouldn 't let me see you !
who does she think she is ?
it 's none of her business .
well , don 't stand there .
sit down , mr. privat .
after all , it was your mother 's idea , to go with mr. privat .
if you want to , of course .
when 's that gonna be ?
well , today .
you see , i finished packing your suitcase .
so you can catch the 2 pm train .
you 'll see , you 'll be better off there than here .
- why so fast ?
- aunt victoria could make trouble .
trouble ?
yes . by law i don 't have the right to take you .
i 'll have a lawyer if necessary .
i 'll say that it was your mother 's wish and yours as well .
don 't you worry olivier .
you 'd only get miserable here .
there are too many memories .
i wonder if i have time to say goodbye to mado .
you and your mado , i tell you !
better hurry , you don 't want to miss the 2 pm train .
get on with it .
olivier !
i 'm so happy to see you .
you gave us such a scare !
when did you get back ?
this morning .
- well , come in !
- no , no .
i came to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
yes .
i 'm going to auvergne with a friend of my mother 's .
it may be the best for you .
olivier !
- hurry up !
- yes .
i 'm coming !
i 'll have to go .
by the way ...
i just wanted to tell you that ...
i 'll never forget you .
goodbye , olivier .
- don 't forget to write me !
- yes , mado .
hey , artilleryman !
hitting the road without saying goodbye ?
yeah . i 'm going to auvergne .
give my regards to the volcanoes !
- okay .
- right , shall we go ?
where you 're going with that suitcase ?
well , i 'm leaving .
- for long ?
- i don 't know .
maybe for good .
don 't forget me too fast , okay ?
come on , oliver .
come .
olivier !
olivier .
i made you some pancakes .
i know you like them so much .
you can eat them on the train .
you were always so sweet .
don 't change too much over there .
okay , i 'll leave you here because ... farewells makes me too sad .
olivier , it 's for your own good , you know that don 't you ?
come on , give me a kiss .
now don 't you worry .
i 'll see you soon .
- thank you , mr. privat .
- goodbye . let 's go .
i say , you 're a real celebrity around here .
have you ever been to saugues , before the funeral ?
no , sir . never .
call me andre .
gare d 'orsay .
get in .
no . i can 't .
i can 't .
what 's the matter ?
i can 't leave my street .
it 's not because of you , but i want to stay here .
- why did you call me , then ?
i thought ... - i know .
it 's my fault .
but i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave bougras , mado ,
capdeverre , loulou ...
i don 't even want to leave i 'araignee .
don 't worry , olivier .
i understand completely .
we will do what you want .
anyway , think about it .
if you need me , write me .
well , goodbye .
olivier !
what 's going on ?
where is mr. privat ?
well , he took a taxi .
how so ?
without you ?
i didn 't want to leave .
what ? are you crazy ?
everything was arranged !
i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave my friends .
and you , of course .
you think you 're gonna stay with us ?
we can 't afford it , you know that !
if that 's the way it 's going to be , i 'll inform aunt victoria .
and the family council will have to decide .
henri , i 'm counting on you .
you will be firm .
as usual , my dear .
wow , check out this tin can !
can you believe this ?
it 's slick .
- really snazzy !
- hey , get away from there !
here we are !
- hello , henri .
- hello , jean .
ah , here 's our little adventurer .
- hello , elodie .
- hello .
you 'll be able to brag about the awful fright you gave us .
oh yes !
you can say that again !
- hello .
- hello .
as you know , the haberdashery has been sold .
i gathered for you some of your mother 's things , olivier .
there are some personal items , souvenirs , photos of your father , - and several school notebooks .
- thanks , aunt .
it 's only natural , olivier .
your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will receive .
say uncle , what is a guardian ?
it means i am responsible for you .
- as if you were my father ?
- yes , something like that .
come one , sort these out in your room .
what 's a family council ?
well , the family gathers to determine what is best for your future .
why can 't i listen to what 's being said ?
because that 's the way it is .
go , please leave us .
take it .
go .
please , let 's sit down and talk .
what do you plan on doing with him ?
us , what do you mean ?
it 's up to you to take him . you 're his aunt .
i 'm only his cousin , and a distant one at that .
come on . i 'm sure we can find a solution together .
one obviously comes to mind .
yes . the orphanage .
that might be a little harsh .
we had something else in mind .
if we wanted to honor virginie 's wishes , it would be up to m. privat to take care of him .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again :
- it is out of the question .
he 's an ex-convict , remember that .
what would the people say in saugues ?
what would they think of us ?
besides , the kid doesn 't want that .
how would you know ?
i suppose i can tell you , now .
on the day he returned from his fugue , he called privat at his estate .
i thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him .
unfortunately , at the last minute , he decided he wanted to stay with us .
if i understand correctly , you decided this without our knowing .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
it would have suited everyone .
i 'm not of that opinion .
but , since you deemed it unnecessary to consult me , it 's because you don 't recognize my right .
it 's up to you to take care of him .
besides , his world is here .
in our milieu , he would be all confused .
that 's it , victoria .
you 're too good for your brother 's son .
i didn 't say that .
no need to be so offensive .
unquestionably , you can 't deny ... that olivier has spent all of his life on this street .
his school and his friends are here .
besides , at this moment , with my son coming down with tuberculosis , have you thought of the risk of contagion ?
yes , of course i have .
how are we going to feed him ?
- we 're already struggling .
- and this apartment is too small .
i could help you .
temporarily , of course .
well in that case , maybe we could keep him .
we would need ...
i don 't know ... 150 francs a month .
- what ? half of that would be plenty .
that just wouldn 't be enough .
but we will make an effort until the end of the school year .
after that , we won 't be able to .
you do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon .
elodie , you 've been chanting that for the last 2 years .
how can you say that , victoria !
- i didn 't mean to offend you .
- that 's too easy ! jean , tell her to get out of here !
now , now , precious , victoria has apologized .
implying that we 're only good at making babes with tuberculosis , that takes the cake !
i will not stay here one second longer .
- let 's go , henri .
- no . wait for me in the car .
what a mess !
especially since we agreed to a settlement .
henri , i would think that with 115 ... okay , let 's say 110 , we could make ends meet . come now , let 's not negotiate again .
our proposition stands at 100 .
if that doesn 't work out , we can always discuss it further .
- so let 's start with 100 .
- here is the first month 's .
- goodbye , henri .
- yes , goodbye .
elodie .
elodie , open the door , please .
ah , you !
you could have taken my side at least !
they were ready to give us 100 francs . i wasn 't going to mess with that .
lucky for us , i patched things up !
you call that patching things up ?
you know it won 't be enough .
i told you , we need at least 130 franc .
if i work for the rest , maybe i can stay ?
you know the answer is yes .
you 're eavesdropping .
but not for long . but why ?
because you 're a pain , that 's why .
all you care about is whether you can stay or not !
look at you .
you 're yelling at the kid , yet in front of victoria , you can 't grow a pair !
you ... looks like you 're courting back luck .
i got it , i got it !
" dear david ,
" it 's been 6 weeks to this day since your departure .
" i have no news from you , which means you 're probably busy ,
" as well as your parents . "
hey , olivier , you coming ?
we 've made our own wading pool .
now , let me give you some advice .
come play with us instead of wasting ink ...
- on a guy who 'll never answer you .
- would you leave me alone , loulou ?
come on , loulou !
i 'm coming !
glazier !
glazier !
so , artilleryman , you still here ?
why the sad face ?
david is gone .
i have no news of him .
i can 't stay with my cousins .
i would have to somewhat earn my keep .
you could always help me with my chores , right ?
you 'll see , earning your keep isn 't that hard .
and if you ask me , you shouldn 't waste your time like this , staring for hours at your mother 's old boutique .
that won 't bring her back , you know .
i know it 's not fair .
and with your best friend gone .
you feel abandoned .
but friends ... you still have quite a few around here .
and you 'll make new ones .
see , look at your buddies .
you have to open up , olivier .
you understand ?
come on , olive !
no bad feelings !
go on , go !
come on , we 're having a splash !
hurry up , for god 's sake !
aren 't you done yet wasting this water ... with your stupid games ?
- bunch of gutter-puppies !
- we 're doing nothing wrong .
" nothing wrong " ?
what if there 's a fire , where would the water come from ?
come on , mr. gastounet , have you never been young ? children should have fun .
what right have you , madame ?
i have no lessons to learn from a .... from a hooker .
are you afraid you might get hooked , mr. gastounet ?
i think i could teach you a few things .
let 's stop there .
i have nothing to say to you .
you started it , old fart .
she really nailed you , gastounet !
you anarchist , i have nothing to say to you .
and you ? who do you think you are , you old grinch .
we 're not about to stop the children from having fun !
taking the moral high ground instead of sweeping his own porch .
what a sourpuss !
- how 's the work coming downstairs ?
- very well , very well .
- bougras says we 'll be done by 5 .
- good .
that 's very good .
here you go , two cheese sandwiches .
enjoy . thank you very much .
ah ... there 's i 'araignee .
thanks .
good day , sir , you okay ?
no , i 'm not okay .
the salvation army and soup kitchen close in the spring .
i 'm hungry . artilleryman !
where are my sandwiches ?
coming , coming !
good lord , a nice shot of red and a cheese sandwich .
the only 2 things worth living for !
hey , hey ... easy there little feller .
i offer for the taste , not to guzzle .
if you 're thirsty , drink water .
would you like a fag , monsieur bougras ?
ernest gave them to me .
oh no . bougras , he always sticks to the pipe .
say , monsieur bougras ...
why do you have a beard ?
it 's to hide the ugly mug underneath !
now then , back to work !
look here , i think you 're filling them up too much .
you trying to get me sloshed ?
- see you , ernest .
- see you !
well , my cellar rats ?
mission accomplished , boss !
but there are 3 bottles that are a bit cloudy .
that 's normal , it 's the bottom of the barrel .
you can have them .
not a bad lot , but i can 't sell them .
- good . now , we agreed on 25 franc ?
- yes , that 's it .
- here , then .
- thanks .
here , this is for you .
ten francs ?
but it 's too much , mr.bougras .
didn 't you say you needed extra dough to help your cousin ?
and to top it off , here 's an eggplant for suppertime .
here .
- but why ?
- it 's not for your work ,
i owed your mother money , but i forgot .
you can check the ledgers , it 's all in writing .
in that case , thanks !
that should help with your keep .
your cousin will probably want you to stay , now .
- what can i get you ?
- anything you want , except red .
nothing for me , i have errands .
- so long , ernest .
so long , bougras .
- so long , kid ! - how about white wine ?
- can 't say no to that .
that must be him !
you know how late you are ?
where were you ?
- we started without you .
- forgive me , elodie .
- good lord , you 're reeking of wine !
- and what 's this ?
a leg of veal !
leg of veal ?
- you didn 't steal it i hope ?
- no . no . i 've been working with bougras at the transatlantique .
in that case , that 's really nice of you .
i even brought you some wine , jean .
beaujolpif ?
let 's have a swig !
- would you like a bit ?
- sure i would .
- so , how is it ?
- not bad , not bad .
excellent , yeah !
see ? he 's not a bad kid , after all .
we would keep you if we were rich , you know .
no worries . i could stop going to school .
i could scrounge a bit more with bougras .
i would earn more money and help you out .
don 't be stupid , olivier !
you think your mom would approve of you turning into a street urchin ?
you don 't want to go to school , anymore ?
end up as a drop-out like bougras ?
if i could have stayed longer in school , we wouldn 't be here today .
he 's right . you 're lucky to have your aunt victoria .
- we 're too young .
- and you don 't want me around .
that 's not true .
don 't say that ..
but taking care of you is a sacrifice .
if he had to work , people would say we 're exploiting him .
his aunt should take him in .
no ! you also said she 's a cow .
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , you 'll still go to school .
alright , jean .
may i have some more ?
you certainly have an appetite this evening .
i 'm flattered .
here you go !
thanks , elodie .
look at this scoundrel .
no wonder his plate emptied so fast !
show me your napkin .
it 's for a kitten .
a kitten ?
you think we 're stupid ?
no , i swear it !
a kitten eating potatoes ?
that 'll be the day !
come on , give it to me .
no , wait !
don 't throw it out !
why not ?
you 'll see .
go ahead , put it in .
that way , we 'll have an hour or two to ourselves .
yes , you 're right .
here you go , olivier .
go feed that kitten of yours .
- thanks , jean .
- alright , scram .
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
and you turn off the light .
very well .
see you tomorrow , elodie !
- no funny stuff , okay ?
- don 't worry .
your vest !
thanks .
elodie ...
i think we 're too soft on him .
the longer he stays the more he gets attached .
you think i 'm not getting attached ?
what are you doing here ?
thanks , kid .
smells good !
it was better when it was hot .
it 's veal with potatoes .
good , huh ?
delicious .
i 'll eat it later .
i also have a fag .
i 'm in heaven !
that 's swell !
i have something for you .
it 's an anthology on the language of flowers .
i didn 't know flowers could talk .
not on their own , of course .
if a man offers one to a woman , it speaks without making a sound .
each flower has its own meaning .
that is the language of flowers .
hey , olivier , want to join me ?
i 'm going to the basilica to see the night over paris .
i can 't go .
don 't you see i 'm chatting with my buddy ?
your loss .
girls ....
they 're such leeches .
you won 't always think that .
given that a laborer earns 35 franc per day , and works 48 weeks of 5 and half days each year , what could he set aside at the end of the year ?
a few beans , monsieur !
chateauneuf , bring to me whatever you are reading .
the language of flowers ?
we have a poet in our midst .
let 's see if you 've at least learned something .
what is , according to this leaflet , the meaning of ... the oak-leaf geranium ?
it symbolizes true friendship .
that is correct .
the white japanese camellia ?
perfect beauty .
- and the acacia ?
- elegance , monsieur .
you see , if you want , you 'd get better grades !
yes . yes .
- hello , mado .
- hello , olivier .
for me ?
oh , you shouldn 't have !
they are magnificent .
they didn 't cost me anything .
i went to the opening of les halles with bougras .
we gave a hand to a flower merchant .
red roses .
you know what it means when a man offers red roses to a woman ?
no , not at all .
it 's a statement of passionate love .
oh yeah ?
would you like a cup of tea ?
oh yeah ! i love tea , now .
here .
take it .
tell me , any news from your friend david ?
no .
and i wrote him so many letters .
don 't worry , i 'm sure you 'll get one soon .
i don 't care anymore .
i 'll make new friends .
that i am sure of .
now .
i must get dressed .
you stay here and finish your tea .
i just step into the other room .
i 'm keeping warm all over , my little heart is as white as a toad 's underbelly .
worries , i have but a few .
troubles , i couldn 't care less .
what 's gotten over you ?
i got promoted to film editor at pathe cinema .
really ? that 's swell !
you bet your ass !
i 'm starting on the newsreels , and after that i can work ... my way up to the big movies .
that dress i saw in the galeries , maybe we can afford it , now ?
elodie , i can see it right now over your shoulders .
and the tandem .
we 'll get the bike too . for our sunday outings !
oh yeah !
say !
maybe you can keep me now ?
if i have the means , olivier .
if i have the means .
you know , elodie is pregnant .
can you imagine ?
a baby and you in this tiny apartment ?
you 're expecting a baby ?
well , yes .
that 's neat !
when is it due ?
well , in 5 months .
you see , it still gives you some time .
anyway , i 'm really happy for you .
i forgot , olivier !
you must hurry .
mr. privat came to see you .
mr. privat ?
he 's in paris ?
yes , just a stopover .
he 's waiting for you at the marcadet palace to see a movie .
so go !
you gotta hurry .
don 't forget your vest !
when our teacher talks about the war , he never mentions any of this .
is that how it really was ?
far worse .
it was a slaughterhouse .
i shouldn 't have brought you to see this .
for a child , it 's too sad .
i remember a time .
papa would always say : " that fucking war . "
what was my dad like ?
i 've told you already .
you father and i were friends long before the war .
he was injured during the assault on the marne .
he wrote me saying they had captured lots of german soldiers ... completely drunk from guzzling too much champagne .
ours !
our champagne !
he got hurt two days later , during a counter- strike .
your dad was right :
" fucking war ! "
my mom would always answer him ... that it was thanks to the war they got married .
father was wounded and mother was the nurse , and that 's how it all started .
it 's a beautiful story .
yes , olivier .
it 's a beautiful story .
come on .
there 's bougras !
he 's a sandwich man , now ?
playbill ?
one for you .
get your playbill right here .
he 's my buddy .
i 'll introduce you .
hey , hey , my artilleryman , on vacation i see ?
enjoying the flick ?
good day , monsieur bougras .
i 'd like you to meet mr. privat . he was my mother 's best friend .
we just saw the wooden crosses .
it was well done .
in terms of bloodbaths , this one was well done , yes .
you got nothing better to do than take him to a war film ?
you shouldn 't say that .
mr. privat is a hero .
you 're nuts if you think that !
as if there were heroes in a war .
in a war there 're only victims and assassins .
how many krauts did he kill ?
ten ?
twenty ? fifty ?
that 's it ?
and today , we proudly sport medals !
what you really want is that he admires you .
wasn 't it enough to lose an arm ?
would it please you , if he also goes to war .
no , sir .
you 're wrong .
i wish he will never have to .
that 's what we fought for .
yeah , yeah , la-dee-da , la-dee-la !
yeah , i 've heard it before .
i know the tune .
you 'd better take him to luna park instead , to see charlie chaplin .
it would be funnier .
ah , what the fuck .
you make me sick .
- see you later , mates !
- wait ...
bougras ...
as for you , don 't bother me .
you 're a twit , just like the others .
i don 't ever want to see you .
good morning , monsieur bougras .
something wrong , olivier ?
no , i 'm fine .
it 's just that mr. bougras doesn 't want to see me anymore .
ah , i wouldn 't worry about it .
he 's a bit like me .
sometimes , we get angry at the whole world .
it comes and goes .
- want to do something for me ?
- yes , what ?
a shelf came down in my room .
no sweat . after school , i 'll fix it impeccable .
- see you later .
- see you later .
there .
just like new .
thank you , olivier .
here , could you place this on the shelf ?
sure .
oh , darn !
" the terrible fall of daniel . "
" daniel , king of the trapeze . "
" the terrible fall .
last night in paris , during his performance ...
" at the winter circus , the famous trapeze artist daniel ...
" fell 12 m to the ground . "
" daniel 's terrible accident . "
" unbelievable but true :
daniel still the best . "
do you know this daniel ?
he 's a buddy of yours ?
it was you ?
you were flying the trapeze ?
here , that was you ?
if you don 't mind , this stays between us .
but why ?
out of vanity .
you see , i still rather inspire fear than pity .
oh my , you sure have a lot of books !
oh , once i had many more .
i sold nearly all of them .
everyone has to eat .
what a shame .
i 've become attached to this neighbourhood , to this street .
i wouldn 't want to leave it and wind up in an old people 's home , even if i was better off , given my condition .
i understand you .
i don 't want to leave either .
and why would you ?
jean and elodie will soon have a baby .
when the baby is born , they won 't be able to keep me .
there might a way .
look , behind the cupboard . that 's your cousin 's place .
so that means i sleep right over there .
i say , that is funny !
here , i 'd like to give you a book .
not just any book , mind you .
it 's a bit thick , but once you 've read it , life and books will no longer hold secrets for you .
pretty heavy , hey ?
it 's the weight of knowledge .
" amouillante ,
" noun , feminine and adjective :
" cow ready to calve .
" amor ,
" latin word meaning love :
" physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another , "
" physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another . "
capdeverre .
five . and i went easy on you .
you obviously want to be a boxer , but it looks like ... you forgot to take your gloves off before starting your essay .
loulou .
zero .
not a bad piece , even funny at times .
however , gangster is not a profession .
if your ideals only tend toward dough , shooters and broads , you 'll hit the slammer faster than a jackrabbit .
chateauneuf .
why did your write your essay in verse ?
i don 't know , it 's more beautiful !
" he who pushes his talents accomplishes nothing with grace , " my child .
anyway , i do see the effort .
and in terms of vocabulary , you went the extra mile .
however ... i do ask myself , why do all of your aspirations start with the letter a ?
you contemplate becoming an : acrobat , architect , administrator , athlete , armorer , aviator , ambassador , astrologer , anthropologist ... and artistic lyricist .
careful not to spread yourself too thin .
i gave you an 8 .
it 's a little harsh , but see it as an encouragement .
ernest .
i would have liked to see you become as imaginative .
you 'd like to be a coffee-shop owner , like papa .
excuse me , mr. gastounet .
children , our country is facing hard times .
president doumer was shot down at noon today by a madman .
his situation is hopeless .
consequently , you will all go home to your parents .
and tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mourning .
- yeah !
all this will finish badly , very badly ...
and so , in this edition , we 'll follow the funeral of president paul doumer ... and the results of the legislative elections , and also the leftist swing in parliament .
so ... for doumer 's funeral , we went all out .
we have 7 cameras .
one at the entrance and exit of the elysee , and all along the procession route in paris .
this way , we 'll have a good assessment of the crowd : tens of thousands of mourners .
the assassin :
goryoulov .
it 's the only record we have .
we have no footage .
and we 'll end with the elections .
it 's familiar ground , but at least we 'll give out some results .
the left wins 91 seats .
lights !
that 's good .
it 's good , but i want everything ... you 've got on the assassination and funeral of doumer .
nobody cares about the elections .
especially since your footage is as dull as dishwater .
yes , you 're right .
sir , although the footage of doumer 's funeral is powerful , the real important event are the elections .
for the first time in many years , the left regained a majority !
young man , the people want to see something spectacular .
the face of charles lindbergh when told about the death of his son , or the skater sonia henie , or doumer on his death bed ; not what they read about 3 days before .
agreed . but we can 't downplay the upsurge by the left .
first of all , the left is not yet the ruling party .
second , learn to mind your own business .
oh , but it is my business !
i 'm a citizen just like you .
alright . we 'll see about that later .
you should have seen the way i nailed the producer today !
he didn 't even want to talk about the elections !
aren 't you 're not pushing your luck ?
you just started there . i know you with your big mouth !
oh , don 't get me started !
what do you call this ?
- it 's a surprise .
- really ?
who made this hole in the wall ?
don 't worry .
the landlord made it .
oh yeah ?
what for ? well , when the neighbour moved out , i told the landlord we needed more space for the baby .
- he had to study the wall 's integrity .
- did he say yes ?
yes . he 'll come to talk about raising the rent .
that would be fantastic !
we wouldn 't have to move to a larger flat .
right .
l 'araignee used to live here .
yes . this morning , he was taken to the old people 's home .
he asked to be taken .
he found it harder to get up the stairs .
we won 't see him anymore ?
well , one man 's loss is another man 's gain .
listen , before checking out , he left some books for you .
have a look .
- may i say something ?
- go ahead .
with this room , if i sleep here ... i 'll be less of a burden .
we want this to be the baby 's room .
i know , but in the meantime .
you , when your mind is set on something ...
alright , then .
until the baby is born , you can squat .
- yeah !
- and tomorrow , i 'll take you to the studio . you 'll work all day as an extra on a movie set .
look at that .
- what a beauty !
- it 's a delage .
last word of advice : when you 're on the set , and the red light is on , you gotta shut up .
- especially when you hear the clapper .
- understood . and never look in the camera .
let 's go say hello .
- good morning , fernand .
- jean , i need to talk to you . the kid 's an extra for the day . i 'm taking him now on the set .
jean , it 's not about the kid .
it 's about you . you can 't go in anymore .
you 're joking , right !
no , i 'm not joking . they 're letting you go .
here 's you 're last pay .
i 'm fired ? just like that ?
i want to see a manager !
the boss is not here this morning .
come back this afternoon .
but i doubt they 'll change their minds .
well i won 't take this lying down .
they don 't know who they 're dealing with .
i 'm not going !
no . you must go .
we 'll take the other street and blend in with the extras .
- jean ! - don 't give me a rough time .
- but , jean !
why must you always talk about politics ?
how will we manage now with the landlord ?
we 'll have to pay for the hole .
i 'm sure we 'll find a solution .
did you see about getting your job back as a boom operator ?
yep . they already filled the position .
but that can 't be !
why must this be happening to us right now ?
here .
my wages for being an extra .
you can have it .
i hope it helps to pay for the baby 's room .
now there 's a repeat performance !
we 're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself .
you don 't care about us .
you just want to make sure you can live here ! no , jean .
that 's not true , i swear it .
i swear it !
you 're selfish !
hypocrite !
i don 't want your fucking dough !
listen ! i 'm out of action .
there 's no way we can support you .
get the hell out !
but , jean !
why did you tell him that ?
hey , kitty .
minou .
come back !
fire !
fire ! fire !
hey , where do you think you 're going ?
did you start this fire ?
you 're in big trouble you little brat !
- but i didn 't do anything , sir .
- and this , what do you call this ?
why did you start this fire , miserable arsonist .
- you 're parents will have to pay .
- they 're both dead .
you don 't get off that easy .
anymore tricks up your sleeve ?
leave him alone .
i know this kid . he 's the haberdasher 's orphan .
- he even stole from his cousins .
- he 's a hooligan .
- he belongs in a reform school !
- but i did nothing wrong !
c 'mon folks , what 's this : the apocalypse !
c 'mon , leave him alone .
this rapacious mutt just set fire to a dwelling of honest folks !
" honest folks ! " ha , ha !
show me half a dozen ! even one or two if you can !
have you never been a kid and done stupid things ?
c 'mon ! clear away !
c 'mon , hop on , kid !
c 'mon , c 'mon !
cheers , mates !
rise up , rise up !
the hour is near to start the revolt !
the hour is near to start the revolt .
yipper !
now my olive .
hang in there . it 's all over .
will i have to go to reform school ?
of course not . no reform school .
you 're with jean and elodie , you 're not alone .
as a matter of fact , jean lost his job .
- they can 't keep me anymore .
- shit . talk about bad luck .
i sure hope i 'araignee didn 't leave for nothing .
why do you say that ?
he made me swear i wouldn 't tell anyone , especially you .
he left his room for your benefit .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
he wanted you to stay .
so he arranged a meeting ... between elodie and the landlord .
but i didn 't want him to leave !
- tell me it 's not true .
- i 'm afraid it is .
that 's why you can 't go .
do you understand ?
c 'mon , artilleryman , we can 't lose hope , right ?
you 'll see , things will work out for jean .
and that little mishap with the fire , it 's nothing serious .
not at all ...
besides , nothing should be taken seriously .
- so you 're not angry with me anymore ?
- angry ?
- oh , it 's you .
- yep , it 's me . i forgot my keys .
elodie !
elodie . are you there ?
- no .
she 'll be back later tonight .
- what are you talking about ?
ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the transatlantique .
- but the transat is closed in the evening .
- no , no . it 's the annual dinner of the montmartre fellowship alumni .
it will end late .
and you , what 's new ?
nothing .
i 've been looking for work for over a month .
" sorry , sir , there is nothing . "
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
fucking crisis !
one of these days , the keg will blow !
the misers will still get away with it , but not for long !
they 'll get what 's coming to them !
we 'll make mincemeat out of them !
you hear me , olivier ?
look at what i prepared .
stuffed tomatoes !
- you made this ?
mother taught me how .
- i 'll get it , i 'll get it .
- no , stay here , i 'll get it .
- oh . it 's the charming mado !
- good evening , jean .
well , do come in , come in .
sorry to disturb you ...
i was supposed to go out with a girlfriend , but her mom fell sick .
- so i thought maybe you would like to ...
no .
not exactly .
i was thinking more about olivier ...
there is no school tomorrow , i promised to take him to the restaurant .
if that would make him happy .
right olivier ?
would you like to go out with mado ?
oh yes , jean .
thank you !
i won 't bring him back late .
i hope not !
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
here . i brought you a tie so you 'll look elegant .
thank you .
i 'll put it on right now . and some gomina gel .
alright , get a move on !
so ... everything arranged for tomorrow ?
you 're certain ?
yes .
at what time they 'll pick him up ?
at 2 pm . his uncle henri will pick him up .
poor kid ...
he 's doesn 't know yet ?
no .
it will be a terrible blow .
yes , i know .
anyway , thanks for taking him out tonight .
i really like him , you know .
i 'm ready !
oh , my . really classy , olivier !
monsieur will taste the wine .
ah , it is good , huh !
a little warm .
it is not warm , young man , it is ambient .
my friend bougras says the saint-emilion is better when brought up from the cellar .
would you have a bottle from the cellar ?
we do . but if i may , i would not recommend it .
but monsieur maurice !
if it 's madame 's wish , we get a bottle from the cellar .
and may madame and monsieur enjoy an excellent meal .
thank you .
lesson number 5 : the client is king .
forgive me , madame , or mademoiselle ... your face looks familiar .
i 'm sure we 've met before , but i don 't seem to remember .
- perhaps you can help me ?
- sir !
can 't you see i 'm with my fiance ?
and , bingo !
lesson number 6 :
never bother a lady if she hasn 't been introduced to you .
to draw her attention , have a garcon deliver a card .
or flowers .
- to our health !
- ah no . you must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me .
very well , mado .
you could then propose a toast , but not usually with the ladies .
was everything satisfactory ?
it was .... exquisite !
- i would like some sweet strawberries .
- and for the young man ?
how about a nice paris-brest ?
it 's very good .
- isn 't that a bicycle race ?
- no , it 's also a cake .
- sir , do you have plum pudding ?
- most certainly .
- let 's go for the plum pudding !
- very well , monsieur .
apparently , it 's as good as love .
i 'd like to thank you again , mado .
it was really ... really ... romantic !
- ah , i 'll give you back the tie .
- no .
keep it . you 'll have a souvenir of me .
a souvenir ?
but we 'll see each other soon .
that 's what i meant .
you can keep it forever .
alright .
so long , gentleman .
elodie !
elodie !
hello , ernest .
what did he say ? - nothing .
i didn 't tell him .
- what ?
you were supposed to tell him last night .
henri will arrive in half an hour .
but surely , we must tell him now .
i was wondering if we couldn 't keep him .
listen , jean , we 're not starting that again .
it 's not possible .
god knows when you 'll find a job .
and in 3 months i won 't be able to work because of the baby . i 'm sad too .
but that 's how it is . nothing we can do . elodie .
the order for no.4 ! be right there !
it 's coming .
bon appetit .
where is he now ?
he borrowed your fire cups to treat bougras .
well , you 're going to tell him right now .
almost done ?
- only two more to go .
- ah well , go for it .
firing up !
oh , my !
if you can heal me with those , i 'll buy you a drink .
mother would often treat me .
she said it 's better than medication .
okay , do the last one .
firing up !
ooh , that one 's really hot .
now all we have to do is wait .
come in !
greetings , bougras !
greetings , jean .
so , you 're playing doctor , now ?
he 's good at it too . my lord !
it 's gonna be a hot day .
does that surprise you ?
it is after all , the beginning of july .
you know , olivier , in life , there are events more serious than others .
but they shouldn 't lead us to over-dramatize .
everything works out .
all one needs is to show a little willpower .
isn 't that so ?
yes .
olivier , i want you to listen to me .
i have news to tell you .
don 't worry , it 's actually good news .
as you know , henri has become your legal guardian .
that means ... you 'll be like his son .
can you imagine just how lucky you are ?
don 't look so gloomy .
you know we did everything we could to keep you .
but in the long run , it 's for your own good .
from now on , you 'll live in a large apartment , with wall-to-wall carpets .
two housemaids .
two !
you 'll be able to go to college and get a real education .
not to mention , lucky dog , a summer vacation in touraine .
a few dozen hectares , apparently .
you 'll be living like a king !
we didn 't want to tell you sooner so as not to ... as not to ...
well , that 's it .
your uncle 's car should arrive soon .
you mean now ?
right now ? well , yes .
right now .
but couldn 't i go stay with privat instead ?
that , my boy , is your fault .
you had your chance .
now .
i go down to wait for the car .
i 'll let you know .
i gotta pack a suitcase .
no .
you won 't have to .
it 's already packed .
it 's at the transat .
so long , bougras .
take those yogurt jars off of me .
c 'mon , do it quick .
you 'll see , mr. bougras .
usually , if all goes well , in one hour , you should be feeling better .
i 'm sure i 'm will .
thank you , my lad .
you 've been a good nurse .
you took good care of me .
never mind that , i 'll put those away .
is olivier ready ?
now , now , artilleryman .
you 're not gonna start whining ?
you 're not a girl are you ?
no , mr. bougras .
c 'mon , then ...
let 's shake on it , for old time 's sake ?
it 's for me ?
i can 't take it .
it 's too nice .
i can 't .
there you go .
c 'mon , get out of here my olive .
c 'mon .
get out of here . scat !
go !
come on , olivier , you 're not saying goodbye ?
don 't worry , you 'll be like our son , now .
so long , olive .
you 're in luck .
take a load of this car !
goodbye , chateauneuf !
- see you soon , olivier !
- goodbye , olive !
you like mint lollipops , i think .
where are we going , uncle ?
your place ?
you know , we had a look at your school grades , you 'll need classes this summer to catch up .
the director was categorical .
the director ?
the director of the college where you will now further your studies .
it 's a good establishment . you 'll see .
and one of the best in churning out successful students .
marceau , our son , attended this college .
even got an award for latin in the main contest event .
how unfortunate he 's not as healthy as you !
your mother wanted you to get a good education .
ah ... here we are .
i 'll spend the entire summer here ?
but you 'll see , you 'll enjoy it here .
come , let 's go see the director .
say , how long are you staying in touraine , with your delage ?
my chauffeur is prudent , but still it 's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km .
all the same , it 's fantastic . what will they think of next ?
this will be your bed .
please remember to pass along my regards to your wife and to marceau .
- how is he ? - doing fine .
we hope to bring him home by the end of this summer .
however , with this illness , a sword of damocles always hangs above our heads .
i share your concerns .
- dear uncle , may i ... - two minutes .
olivier .
i hope you 'll be as bright as your cousin .
uncle , i need to use the toilet !
have you been following gorgoulov 's trial ?
it 's an abomination !
ah , is the child 's uniform ready ?
it 's the right size .
at least , i hope .
here you go my boy , try this on for me .
what 's the matter with you ?
he pissed himself !
- oliver ... what 's wrong with you ?
- never mind , i 'll take care of it .
come with me , you filthy little boy .
i beg your forgiveness , m. le directeur .
make nothing of it .
how long ago did his mother pass away ?
4 or 5 months .
i 'm worried we might have been a little hasty in all of this .
would you mind if i kept him for this evening ?
no , not at all .
i 'll try to cheer him up .
do you like to go see mayol , the singer ?
not really , uncle .
what then would please you ?
- i 'd love to go to the lapin agile .
- the cabaret in montmartre ?
that establishment does not allow children .
i used to go with my mother .
" parlez-moi d 'amour
" redites-moi des choses tendres
" votre beau discours
" mon coeur n 'est pas las de l 'entendre
" pourvu que toujours
" vous repetiez ces mots supremes "
it 's funny ...
the last time i was here with mama , we were sitting at this very table .
why ever would your mother bring you here ?
we came to dance .
tangos , especially .
olivier , are you crying ?
no .
it 's nothing .
we should not have come here .
it will only make you miserable . no .
on the contrary .
i 'm happy .
very happy .
careful , chateauneuf !
your uncle could have brought you back sooner .
go to bed now . go on .
that should teach you not to wake everybody up .
chateauneuf , don 't be a show-off .
i run a quiet dorm and it will stay that way .
we 're not in montmartre .
- but it wasn 't me , sir . - silence !
we don 't answer back , chateauneuf .
and now , go to sleep . everybody .
you 're a snitch , chateauneuf !
did you hear that ?
he 's from montmartre .
and already snitching on us !
no one talks to him .
he 's now on quarantine .
- yeah , good idea .
- silence !
hey urchin . you can 't play with us .
we don 't need you .
debezieux . well done : 16 / 20 .
saron , almost perfect .
once again , you 've earned 19 .
i kept the best for last .
no , chateauneuf did not get 20 .
after only 2 months , i wouldn 't expect as much from him .
luckily for him , there are no marks below zero , because chateauneuf would have scored -6.5 .
and for your enjoyment , i will demonstrate how chateauneuf ... translates the famous phrase :
" if you want peace
" prepare for war . "
you haven 't made any progress during the summer , chateauneuf .
being mr. desrousseau 's nephew or not , you are not exempt from being intelligent .
follow your cousin marceau 's example . he was my best student .
good morning , olivier .
i 'm marceau , your cousin .
we 've met at the house on a few occasions .
it 's pretty hard to forget .
my latin teacher never stops talking about you .
good morning , marceau .
no need to be formal , lad .
you 're a poet ?
we 'll understand each other !
" child of a fallen leaf ,
" subjected to every wind
" as the weeks and months of summer pass
" wrapped in the sheets of my friends ' solitude
" i call the names of bougras , mado , i 'araignee
" no answer to be heard . they have forgotten me .
" and so i ask :
what has become of them ?
" you , my parents as distant as strangers be
" what secrets have you not dared share with me ? "
not bad .
inspired by rutebeuf , and a bit of a tearjerker , but ... given your situation , this piece is fitting .
that poem is private !
perhaps i should teach you the finer aspects of caesura .
i don 't need your help .
couldn 't i be of use to you in latin ?
- what about your sister ?
- mind your own business .
i 'm starting to like you , obscure little friend .
i was afraid you would bore me .
my parents dumped you here for the whole summer ?
ah , the bastards !
they could have brought you with them to touraine at least !
i sympathize . i spent the last 8 months in the sanatorium .
i 'm cured , finally . i 'm just out and i bring you back home !
isn 't life beautiful ?
the headmaster will never consent .
you 're mother picks me up tomorrow .
nihil obstat .
i 've just seen the principal , and , between two latin quotes , i 've told him that my mother had instructed me to take you home . you are free .
i release you from the bonds of slavery .
long live freedom !
long live andre breton !
- who 's this breton ?
- the pope of surrealism , of course !
the pope of what ? my god !
i 'll need to tend to your education .
you are now entering the holy of holies .
you may enter .
you are familiar with this apartment ? yes .
i mean not that familiar .
you must always look impressed by the luxury ... of good standing that is the foundation of my parent 's success .
they 're really quite vain .
mother , especially .
she 's a great lady , my mother .
she 's wonderful !
i 'm often angry with her , but i adore her anyway .
as for my father , he 's a dreamer who can 't get over having become a successful businessman .
this is the living room .
- you know what he really wanted to be ?
- an opera singer .
- how did you know that ?
- because he told me , of course !
- we went to the lapin agile together .
- that 's just like him !
he took advantage of you to get away .
you 've already reached a level of trust with him ?
yes , but he doesn 't want me talking about it .
to my mother , perhaps .
as for me , you can talk about anything .
this is the dining room .
impressive .
come , i 'll take you to your room .
put your luggage on the bed and follow me .
and this ... is my lair .
you like jazz ?
are you familiar with the duke ?
no .
what about louis armstrong ?
no , not him either .
he 's giving a paris concert at the end of this month .
can you believe it ?
either way , i 'm going to meet him this year .
my parents have offered me a trip to new york for my holidays .
getting sick does have its advantage : your parents will grant your every wish .
can you imagine ?
i 'm going to spend new year 's eve at the cotton club ...
but i have a friend who 's living in new york !
his name is david zober .
i have no news of him .
well then , give me his address .
i will find this little buddy of yours .
are you familiar with benzoin ?
no .
take a seat .
you 'll get to know it .
- it 's an intoxicating oil .
- for cooking ?
of course not !
i 'm talking about the mind , not the body .
do you like this piece ?
yeah , really cool .
indubitably !
duke ellington !
isn 't this dangerous for someone with tuberculosis .
that , my dear , is the least of my worries .
besides , i 'm cured .
you scared ?
no !
- you 've never smoked before ?
- yes , quite often .
some " ich lif " .
my god , what an accent !
high life ! " vie elevee . "
high life .
you will experience the elevation of souls , the communion of spirits .
you see , me ... i would come across as a type of lafcadio .
who 's that ?
- the vatican cellars .
andre gide .
you know him ? - no .
the perfect crime .
when you think of it , the sanatorium had its merits .
i learned the two things a man must lose in his life .
his virginity and his illusions .
here .
" there , everything is order and beauty ,
" luxury , serenity and voluptuousness . "
what is voluptuousness ?
that is about to manifest .
don 't move , i 'll be right back .
olivier .
i 'd like you to meet julienne , my mother 's god-daughter , resident of the demoiselles de la legion d 'honneur .
she holds my mother 's dearest fervor ... when it comes to my marriage .
- julienne , i 'd like to present ...
- i know him , marceau .
- you 're the one who 's mother died .
- yes , that 's me .
out of kindness my parents decided to adopt him .
would you like a benzoin ciggy ?
no , thank you .
my feet are killing me .
saint-denis is quite the walking distance .
olivier , make yourself useful .
julienne has sore feet .
remove her shoes .
come on , hurry up .
slowly , olivier !
unlace them gently .
give them a massage .
my feet are really sore .
don 't tickle me .
just give me a massage .
look .
have you ever seen a woman before ?
have you ever seen a woman 's breasts ?
oh , you little scoundrel !
you 're a pervert !
how dare you !
this is not your place .
now go to your room !
scram !
write me a poem about julienne 's breasts .
- ma 'am , where would you like this luggage ?
- carry them to my room .
marguerite , tell the chauffeur to bring in the apples last .
we 'll put them in the store room .
which is master olivier 's room , now
very well , madame .
good day , mother .
did you have a nice trip ? - excellent !
where were you ?
- at the restaurant , with olivier .
we weren 't going to die of starvation awaiting your return .
come now .
give me a hug instead of making vile remarks .
- how do you feel ?
- i feel great .
let me have a look at you .
you 're right , you do look well .
why did you bring olivier back a day sooner ?
you could have let me know .
i could have avoided the detour to the college .
listen , he 'd been couped up long enough , don 't you think ?
good day , olivier .
good day , aunt .
i suppose marceau has already given you the grand tour ?
he has , yes .
very well . we 'll now go to your room .
since you are here , i will give you ...
- the house rules !
- that 's mean !
i hope you 'll be comfortable here .
this is where we keep the apples that we bring back ... every year from our estate in montrichard .
fortunately for you , the harvest was not abundant this year .
i hope you like apple sauce and apple pie .
here we eat it all the time .
- these are your belongings ?
- yes , aunt .
but they reek !
well , we 'll need to get rid of them .
including the clothes you are wearing .
i will let you have marceau 's old things . you can tell mother is from auvergne :
to her , a spade is a spade .
my dear child , you used to be more witty .
- these books are yours ?
- yes , aunt .
marie bashkirtseff ?
how unexpected !
schopenhauer ?
you mean you 're reading this at your age ?
- no , aunt .
- it so happens he has ... a certain culture .
i 've read one of his poems . it 's quite good .
anyway , what he needs most is a good bath .
i will ask marguerite to wash him in the laundry room . that 's right .
we wouldn 't want him staining the bathtub .
come on , marguerite , scrub harder . he 's got to shine like a new penny .
your cousin is a cute little angel .
- more so than moi , marguerite ?
- that 's not the same thing .
you 're a man , now .
alright , olivier .
come out and dry yourself .
hop , hop !
voila !
i say , aren 't we a wee bit scrawny , my little urchin ?
alright .
i 'm going to burn your clothes like madame said .
show me , olivier .
now , turn around .
it 's funny seeing you wear my old trappings .
" trappings " ?
ah , what an astute word .
do i detect montmartre 's influence ?
marceau , your father and i decided ... to prepare a little surprise for your homecoming .
julienne will join us for dinner this evening .
she will be happy to see you .
she spoke so often of you .
your father is picking her up at the print shop after work .
- are you pleased ?
- yes , mother .
i burn !
oh how i languish for julienne !
i love her , not as in the underworld , the ravager of a thousand men , but faithful , proud and a little diffident !
the divine ...
- good evening .
- good evening , monsieur .
godmother !
good evening , godmother .
my dear , how happy i am to see you .
and i 'm not the only one .
marceau is thrilled that you could join us for his homecoming .
it 's been such a long time since you 've last seen each other .
that 's true !
i even wondered if i would recognize you !
can you imagine ?
it 's now been over a year .
seems to me like it was yesterday .
and your father , do you recognize him ?
a your age you only change every 10 years .
at my age ?
am i that old ?
anyway , you have a much better disposition than when you left .
good to see you .
good .
let us have dinner so that julienne doesn 't get home too late .
i must get you to test drive my new delage .
julienne .
where 's olivier 's setting ?
in the kitchen .
he 's eating with the maids , of course .
why then did you tell him he was a member of the family ?
they cured his illness , but apparently not his character .
thank you .
marceau , return immediately to the dining room .
your stew is truly marvelous , blanche .
thank you , m. marceau .
for the last time , return to the dining room .
delicious , don 't you think ?
blanche , see to it that m. olivier joins us in the dining room .
- yes , madame .
- dear aunt , there 's is no need .
oh please , don 't give me that !
come on , let 's go .
look , olivier .
like this .
sorry , aunt .
it 's not your fault , olivier .
take note however that we don 't say : " sorry , " but " please excuse me . "
in conclusion , olivier , we are too good for you .
well my friend , say something .
yes .
be nice to your mother , marceau .
what is that dress you 're wearing ?
rochas ? poiret ?
no , schiaparelli .
what else you 'd like to know ?
i do like it .
- however ... - yes ?
your necklace doesn 't suit it .
a little flashy , don 't you think ?
we can discuss it further after our meal , if you like .
excellent idea , mother .
besides , after our little cafe , you and julienne could play us a duet ?
with pleasure , god-mother .
with pleasure , mother .
with pleasure , aunt .
olivier !
if you want us to keep you , you must change your attitude .
go to your room immediately .
- but , aunt ...
- immediately !
very well , aunt .
you 're worse than hitler .
marceau , illness doesn 't excuse everything .
i need no excuses , mother . and i 'm not longer ill .
marceau ...
marceau !
marceau , wake up !
wake up !
please , wake up !
i 'm okay . don 't move .
you had a spell .
i 'll get your mother .
no , olivier .
you didn 't see a thing .
but it might be serious .
you must see a doctor .
listen , olivier .
all the tests indicate i am cured .
makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fatigue .
marceau !
olivier , if you are a brother to me , swear you 'll never speak about this to anyone .
okay ?
come on , swear it .
i swear , marceau .
thanks , olivier .
... we are pleased to have him join a jam session , a big round of applause for mister ...
louis armstrong !
i just cut my lip .
don 't mention anything to my divine .
you swear ?
dear students , some of you might wonder why ... you would need to learn latin .
the pope , monsieur . no .
now pick a word at random . - light . - perfect example of latin roots .
light comes from the word lux , the light .
something that is lux-urious is something that is brilliant .
your turn to choose a word , chateauneuf .
poetry .
poetry comes from the latin word poesis , which in turn comes from the greek poiesis , meaning creation .
delepine , which word would you like to know the root of ?
football .
now here 's an example of a barbaric term we adopted , let alone its simple translation in our language .
" football , " in our language should mean :
ball at the foot , from the latin pedibus , meaning foot and ... excuse me ...
medical examination visit .
- i said in silence . - visit . from the word vis .
to see . and medical , from medicus , the doctor .
chateauneuf ? yes , that 's me .
- this is a surprise , olivier ! - good day , mr. lehman .
i mean , doctor .
- i was about to ask you the same thing .
so did i. the number of patients i had in my care was dwindling ;
good , now open wide .
i hate myself for what happened to your mother .
perhaps i didn 't do enough for her .
- you didn 't like me very much , did you ?
- well ...
believe me , i didn 't want to take your father 's place , olivier .
i just wanted to help your mother . in any event , she didn 't like you .
i think she did a bit . now , sit straight .
for you it 's very sad . she died so young .
i see your aunt is taking good care of you .
everything is fine .
you 're in perfect health . that 's it . you can get dressed , now .
thank you , doctor .
tell me doctor ?
- i would like to ask you ...
- yes ?
when people get ... when they come down with tuberculosis , can they get sick again , even after being cured ?
of course .
the terrible thing about this illness , a real cure still hasn 't been found .
if we cough up blood , it means we 're still sick ?
yes , and it 's really serious .
it 's typical , as are repeated coughs , and sometimes even loss of consciousness .
- is it contagious ?
- oh yes , extremely contagious ! but why are you asking me this ? well ...
i want to write a poem on tuberculosis .
on tuberculosis ? yes , why not ?
it 's true , lamartine ...
la dame aux camelias . thank you , doctor .
you 'll make yourself sick reading so much !
are those shoes ready yet , marguerite ?
yes , all done , madame .
good evening , olivier .
reading is a healthy habit , olivier , but not at the table .
what are you reading ?
still reading without family !
but i gave you that one over a month ago .
i love reading it over again .
granted . but there are other books more essential .
you look lovely , dear aunt .
well , aren 't you the gallant one !
this evening gown is for the french club .
henri is taking me . you should say to the " comedie
- francaise , " mother .
how could he possibly understand , he 's unversed .
i know it 's saturday , but getting up at sunset is a bit exaggerated , don 't you think ?
mother , i 'm preparing myself for the time difference .
it is now 11 o 'clock in new york . don 't plan too far ahead , marceau .
your trip is not official yet . don 't forget .
come , my little outcast , i need to speak with you .
thank you , marguerite . you won 't believe what 's happening to me .
i 'm in love ! i met a woman yesterday at a party gathering .
- what party ?
- the communist party !
you know , the reds . she 's simply amazing .
a mix between louise brooks and rosa luxemburg .
she 's a surrealist like me .
a dream come true .
there 's just one problem : she 's 15 years older .
i want to read you a poem i wrote her .
" crimson heart , pierced by faith ,
" may he who has never loved you never reach your depth . "
not bad for a start , don 't you think ? i 'm brilliant .
go ahead , tell me .
" marceau , you 're brilliant . "
- marceau , you 're brilliant .
- oh no , it 's pathetic .
you can 't really understand poetry . you 're stuck on victor hugo or leconte de lisle .
you know nothing about women .
you 've never been in love .
i know nothing about women ?
her name is mado .
and she 's a taxi-girl . - besides , we 're engaged .
- come on .
don 't make up stories just to try to impress me .
you 'll see if i 'm telling the truth . you 'll see . come .
here .
rinse your eyes on this .
she gave it me as a memento .
to someone else , you mean !
you probably stole it from your mother 's boutique .
nice piece , though .
and this is her calling card .
- she gave it to me personally .
you surprise me .
- are you still seeing this mado ?
- of course not .
not since my arrival here . don 't look so sad .
we 'll fix that .
- very pretty ! look . i just started a new novel .
- can you read it to me ?
- yes , of course .
" i was born , like everyone , from a mother and a father .
" and yet , i am not like everyone .
" one question haunts me :
" did my father and mother love each other ?
" were i not conceived in a state of love , i would rather die . "
- you asked me to . you shouldn 't !
you 're violating my intimacy .
you 're a little pervert ! you shouldn 't have ... you don 't understand !
it 's not because you 're older ...
you wouldn 't strike a sick person , would you ?
that 's just it , you 're really sick .
- dr lehman says you 're having a relapse . - what ? who 's this dr. lehman ?
you mentioned me ?
it 's the college physician .
i asked him about tuberculosis .
i know what happened to you the other day .
you were losing consciousness .
if you 're spitting blood , it 's serious and contagious .
you should inform your parents .
i see where you 're going with this .
you want to stop me from leaving , send me back to the sanatorium and take my place , here .
- you 're crazy , marceau . - hypocrite !
you think i didn 't catch your little act with mother ?
" you look lovely , dear aunt . "
- ass-licker .
- i 'm doing it for you !
don 't forget you promised me your silence .
you 're like a brother to me .
i owe you one .
forgive me , mother .
i rather stop here .
i thought you had finally shed the awkward age , but you still revel in it .
spare me your cliches .
my dear , your son is extremely rude right now .
marceau , please !
if you want to go on your trip , you better clean up your act .
you are wanted on the telephone .
hello ! oh yes .
yes . i know who this is .
listen , it 's a delicate issue for me .
good .
i will be there in 15 minutes , under the arches .
let me see olivier .
- he 's not your child . - i know that . but i could be just like a father to him .
he chose not to go with you .
but he 's no longer in his favorite neighbourhood .
please stop right there , monsieur privat . my wife would never allow it .
on what grounds ?
you didn 't take him in out of love .
put yourself in her place .
you came to our home to kill your brother and virginie .
and now you would want to take their son ?
i didn 't kill anyone .
and i spent time behind bars .
thirteen years of my life .
i need this child to give meaning to my life .
but does he need you ?
even if we handed him over to you , think of what people would say .
believe me , i can understand your pain .
but think about the day olivier will learn everything about your past .
i 'm certain he will be able to forgive me .
but once you tell him the whole truth , you 'll be shattering the image he has of his parents .
do you think you have the right to do that ?
there 's a ladder in the courtyard .
you climb up , and down the other side using the street lamp .
a 5 year-old could do it . there you 'll see a bike .
you get on it , and within 10 minutes you wind up at the bouchon de champagne .
here .
here 's some money to have a good time .
i 'll take your place , in case the supervisor can 't sleep .
i don 't think i can pull it off .
i 'm too scared .
i 've done it dozens of times without ever getting caught .
" audaces fortuna juvat , " olivier .
it 's time to see if your life will be that of a sheep , or if you will write it yourself , every day .
don 't you want to see mado again ?
good evening , mam 'zelle mado good evening , m 'sieur hubert .
that wasn 't very smart .
are you angry with me ?
not at all !
i 'm actually moved .
you can 't follow me inside , though .
now there , don 't be sad .
wait , i have an idea .
jules ?
ask g.g. to come out with his accordion .
- i have a little commission for him .
give him 10 francs , he 'll be happy .
- i 'll give him 20 ! - no , that 's too much . you asked for me , mado ?
yes , g.g. here 's a young client for you .
what shall i play for you ?
olivier , what would you like ? a tango !
a tango for my little fiance .
the most beautiful tango in the world ?
- yes , that 's fine .
- i 'm not a very good dancer .
i was forced , and this is only a temporary measure of course , to confiscate this elegant pen which arrived in the mail . - it was intended for olivier ?
- indeed , madame .
in this college , we discourage possession of valuable objects ... which would risk to excite the greed of certain pupils ... towards their more fortunate peers .
i thought it might be you .
i 'm not in the habit of spoiling children with gifts of this value .
- may i see olivier ? - by all means . i 've already sent for him .
he 's waiting in the vestibule .
come in , olivier .
i leave you together .
good day , aunt . who sent you this pen ?
i ...
i don 't know , aunt .
don 't lie to me , olivier .
it could only have come from him .
have the courage to tell me the truth .
yes .
it is a gift from monsieur privat .
i will send it back . you must never accept anything from this man .
but why not , aunt ?
you 're too young to know about these things .
but i need to know !
since you put it like that , i 'll tell you .
one day , in december of 1917 , the war was still raging ,
privat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun .
- he wanted to kill them , olivier .
i don 't believe you . why was my mother intent on living with him ?
i 'm still trying to figure that out . your mother and i never saw eye to eye on many things .
why didn 't you tell me sooner ?
i didn 't want you to get upset .
i hope we never have to discuss this matter ever again .
anyway , sooner or later , you would have found out .
enter .
of course you will .
because you are pure .
wild child .
street child .
- please stop gloating at my expense ! - you see , she dropped me . who did ?
this militant girl who wrote these pathetic lines .
i 'm down to listening to this music for rejected lovers .
all around me ,
" everything is order and beauty . "
and yet , my pain is real . why ?
marceau ...
you knew about ... about my parents and privat ?
what are you talking about ?
well ...
the time privat ... the time he came here .
your mother told me the story . the divine finally coughed it up ?
yes .
privat fired shots at them .
in fact , it happened right here .
in this very room where your parents stayed . i was only 2 at the time .
but look .
look at the mirror .
impacts left by the bullets .
see where love can lead ?
a few centimeters to the side ... and you 'd never have been born , my little outcast .
but rest assured ,
why didn 't you tell me ?
because this story is boring as hell , my friend .
two grown men love the same woman . an ordinary drama based on jealousy .
you 're mama was nothing more than a small-time goddess , as my mother put it .
come on , cheer up .
i don 't want to see you suffer , my little angel . please spare me your expressions of grandeur !
we are both injured and abandoned souls .
like two starlings fallen from the nest .
yes ?
m. marceau , a girl is asking for you .
- a girl ? - mlle charlotte dalet . charlotte ?
have her come in , quick !
a woman leaves me , i find another . - who is she ?
- the nurse from the sanatorium . - the one who ...
- who taught me how to love . - you know what you have to do ?
- change wards .
- good day , marceau .
- charlotte ! what a joy to see you again !
i 'll give you some privacy .
stop it , marceau .
so , if i can 't kiss you , what brings you to paris ?
i shouldn 't be telling you this , but i don 't want to deceive you .
the director will be sending a letter to your parents .
a letter ?
whatever for ? you 're having a serious relapse , marceau .
the lab you visit for your routine check-ups ... has sent us the results of your samples .
the samples indicate you are once again infected .
but you said i had been cured .
the pneumothorax was extremely effective .
but when it comes to tuberculosis , you can never be sure . i must go back to the sanatorium ?
i 'm afraid so .
upon your release , you registered less than 1000 bk .
but today , you must be well over 100.000 ! it 's a serious relapse .
you must start a new treatment .
worst of all , you could have infected your entire family .
i understand why you wouldn 't let me kiss you .
how convenient for you .
you can work on my case .
i 'll be once again your little patient . i 'll be there with you .
every hour , every second ! - you have no right to say that !
even if the truth is painful to hear . so there , goodbye !
are we eavesdropping , now ?
i 'm expecting a love letter .
- you 're at that age !
- see you .
well , well . a letter for olivier .
it 's from america .
nothing for me .
i am gloom , the grieving inconsolable widower .
" the prince of aquitaine at the forsaken tower ! "
marceau the early bird .
- i hope you 're not ill , at least .
of course not , mother .
i feel great !
what 's with him this morning ?
he must be in love , madame .
good for him .
but not a word about this to julienne .
get up , lazy- bones !
even though we 're on vacation , we don 't get up any later .
america ?
thank you , marguerite .
it 's from david .
he must have quite a few stories to share !
there are tons of postcards !
- skyscrapers ! - and even photos .
show me .
the mail has arrived ?
obviously , because you received your letter .
- but , marceau ?
- monsieur marceau ?
you 're not going to read your letter ?
- did he get mail this morning ?
- no .
he was so disappointed his new sweetheart hadn 't written to him .
what are you doing ?
i 'm depositing the 2nd mail batch , as i always do at noon .
there is a 2nd mail run ?
of course . this is paris !
since you 're going back to college i advise you to take a balzac .
it will take you all week to read " les illusions perdues . "
or even " la cousine bette . "
good morning , father .
i just received a letter that concerns you . really ?
you know what it might be about ? no , i can 't think of anything . you know , this american friend i wrote to ... ?
well , he agreed .
he would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish .
i can now confirm your travel arrangements .
you will embark on the de grace , on the morning of december 16 .
- happy ? - you bet !
your mother and i are sad you won 't spend christmas with us .
but more important , we want you to be happy . you 'll see , mr. dewilde will make good company .
what does he do for a living ? he owns a few movie theaters in new york .
they call them nickelodeons .
ah yes , the penny cinema .
here 's one ... a letter from the sanatorium .
i have a hunch i know what it 's about .
it 's what i thought .
well they 've got some nerve !
they 're claiming reimbursement for a window pane i broke by accident .
medical services are already expensive . they should cover that .
i 'll call the director immediately .
hello , mademoiselle ?
get me number 16 at st - pierre - les
- bains , haute - loire .
marceau desrousseau speaking .
i 'd like to speak to the director , please . thank you .
i beg you , marceau , be diplomatic .
take the receiver .
and learn from the master .
hello ? mister director ?
yes :
no , not very well .
my parents just received a letter from your accounting department .
it claims reimbursement of a window pane i accidentally broke .
it was a mistake ?
i 'm happy to hear it .
i will let you take care of it .
thank you , mister director .
give my best to madame .
goodbye . you had gall .
yes , you went straight to the point !
from now on , i will have you deal directly with my creditors .
with pleasure , father .
monsieur is served .
you 're crazy , marceau .
voila .
tell me what you think .
" concerning the state of health of our son .
" in a sanatorium close to paris .
" as soon as we can , we will inform you of the ...
" address of this establishment ,
" so that you may share with them our son 's medical records .
" yours truly ... " etc .
pretty good , right ? you 're out of your mind , marceau .
you can 't do that .
charlotte said it would be suicide .
charlotte says that to keep me in the sanatorium . as you can see , i 'm in good health .
that 's not true , marceau . even yesterday i could hear you coughing .
excuse me .
i must mail this at once .
stand up !
stand up ! companions in misery .
- what 's going on , olivier ?
- i want you to stay out of this . - you 'll be able to go back ...
- once you 're back to health .
- nothing could be more uncertain .
so i would prefer being overseas .
i would rather die at the cotton club instead of the asylum .
you won 't say a word about it to my parents .
you promised .
yes , but i didn 't know just how serious this is .
not to say the number of people you can contaminate .
i will tell them everything . if you do , i 'll tell them of your outing to mado .
they 'll send you to your grandpa 's to become a blacksmith 's apprentice .
you 're such a bastard .
i don 't give a damn ! - i don 't want you to die , you understand ?
- i think you just want me to stay here .
you wouldn 't have the balls .
just wait and see .
- who is it ? - it 's me , olivier .
come in .
something really serious .
well , what is it ?
it 's , hm ...
i 'm sorry i didn 't make it to the circus on my birthday .
that 's it ?
you scared me . it was quickly forgotten , olivier .
i forgive you , of course .
you must get up early tomorrow . the holidays are over .
yes , aunt .
such a strange boy .
ah ! if he had marceau 's education !
if marceau had his state of health !
- so that 's it . you 're going to play me like a violin , now ?
really , you 're not sparing me anything .
you think i 'm going to roll over like a dog ? " don 't go , i 'll spill the beans "
you 're totally wrong .
here , you forgot you beret .
you 'll be back within the hour .
you read too much " without family . "
you should reflect on the difference between literature and reality .
- farewell , marceau .
wake up , olivier . it 's time !
it 's 7 o 'clock .
but ...
olivier ?
- you haven 't seen him ? - no .
not this morning . yes .
he told me he had to leave to review his latin .
i helped him till past midnight .
he was probably intent on leaving without waking me .
i came to tell you he 's ill .
a simple phone call would have sufficed .
i have fond memories of this place .
i didn 't want to miss the opportunity .
as for your cousin , i hope it 's nothing serious .
i was their family physician in montmartre .
yes of course , montmartre .
hey ! guys !
they should count their forts .
we should have some enemies .
we were once at peace , but everybody got confused .
hey ! wait for me .
you 're not fighting anymore with the riffraff of bachelet st. ?
that 's ancient history !
let 's go , i 'm starved . see you ! see you capdeverre .
i 'm hungry too .
see you later ! see you , loulou .
don 't you look dapper in those god awful pants !
so long .
i need some grub too .
so long , riri .
bougras !
m 'sieur bougras !
- where to ? - i have no idea .
if you see him again , tell him ... he ran a pigsty in here .
it reeked as hell !
no problem , young man .
they 're in a rush and i 'm under the gun .
- jean is fine ?
- not so bad . - did he find work ?
- yes .
yes . and how is the baby ?
- leg of lamb " soissons . "
- coming up . - you were saying ?
- you 're baby , how 's he doing ? an apple pudding with leg of lamb " soissons . "
bon appetit .
the baby ?
he 's adorable .
he 's with mrs. hacque .
she 's babysitting . go see him !
will do , elodie .
so long , elodie .
glazier !
he 's a bit like your cousin .
isn 't he the cutest ?
i often take care of him .
poor elodie never stops .
and with jean without a steady job , and he likes to drink a bit .
in the end , you did well to leave .
- but i was forced to leave !
- well , you know what i mean .
you were such a hooligan !
your aunt and uncle ... do they treat you well ?
yes , madame hacque .
in retrospect , your mother 's death ...
i wouldn 't say it was a lucky break , far from it , mothers are irreplaceable .
but for your future ...
often we say : a blessing in disguise .
ah , here comes elodie .
it 's me , my little treasure !
my love , it 's your mama .
i came to tell you i won 't be off work until 2 : 30pm .
he 's a real cakewalk your little cherub .
you gave me a hell of a scare my little angel .
that 's too easy .
you 're a bastard , marceau .
you think you can just die off like that ?
do whatever you like with your life ?
didn 't you think about the others ?
your parents ? julienne ?
me ?
what will become of me if you ... if you die ? now , now .
don 't worry so much .
that 's enough .
you want me to say you 're right .
is that it ? i have given it some thought .
i decided i 'll talk to my parents .
you 're lying . hang on , my doubting thomas .
you want my passport ?
they 're yours .
without them , i can 't go . it 's a trick .
you 'll only take them back !
what else do you need , then ?
- give it to me .
- it 's a trick !
i 'll show you a trick .
so , little outcast ?
happy now ?
dear olivier ,
the landscape hasn 't changed much in the last 6 months .
boredom here has reached a new philosophical dimension .
luckily , the pain from the pneumothorax keeps me awake .
i 'm so jaded that seeing your face again would bring back my spirits .
and so , if you can , please come .
the sanatorium is near saugues . find a way to get sent away to live with your grandpa .
i wait for you , my olive , without fail . - marceau
this morning , therefore , the supervisor found olivier 's scarf in the yard .
yes , and what of it ?
it was found at the bottom of the gardener 's ladder ... which was leaning against the school wall , ostensibly in order to jump over to the other side .
furthermore , in doing olivier 's bed , the chambermaid found this .
i judged it would be best to notify you before talking to olivier .
you don 't think that olivier ... mister director , i know him . i can 't imagine him doing such a thing .
and yet , the evidence is obvious . i 'd say a little too obvious .
do you believe , mister director , that a student jumping the wall would leave the ladder behind ?
moreover his scarf bearing his name ?
or keeping such compromising evidence in the dormitory ?
i would rather think he was the target of a prank .
a very bad schoolboy prank . i think my husband is correct in his assessment , mister director .
our nephew knows what fate would await him should he do such a thing .
we would send him off to his grandparents , in auvergne .
you 're probably right .
i should have known better . if one of our students was bent on tarnishing the image of your nephew , rest assured he will be punished accordingly .
i will deal with this matter immediately .
what happened in 1685 ?
delepine ! the assassination of henri iv by ravaillac , monsieur .
he would have been mighty , this ravaillac , to assassinate a king who had been dead for 75 years !
yes , susse !
1685 , revocation of the edict of nantes by louis xiv , sir .
well done . now , what happened in ...
be seated , children .
i 'm here to discuss a serious matter .
it would appear that one of you ... wanted to get chateauneuf accused of jumping the wall .
his scarf was left behind in the yard as evidence ... and other objects i won 't mention at this time , were planted in his personal belongings in the dormitory .
perhaps it was only meant as a stupid prank . but i would summon the guilty party to come forth in this instant , otherwise i will have to take measures against the entire class .
" a fault confessed is half redressed . " gentlemen !
i 'm waiting .
chateauneuf , you would like to speak ?
nobody played a trick on me , sir .
i did jump the wall last night .
i don 't want the entire class punished on my account .
- and where did you go ? - to see a friend .
the girlies !
- what do you mean : " the girlies " ?
- the streetwalkers , sir .
olivier !
shame on you ! you 're a disgrace .
i don 't want you living with us anymore .
at least you don 't look like a hooligan !
come on , let 's go .
ho , victor !
can 't this wait ?
- she 's all yours , antonin . - you 're holding us up .
adios !
give it to me .
you will call me " tonton . "
and that girl ... not a word about her to granny .
all right , tonton .
you 'll see . there isn 't much here to lift grannie 's spirits .
she 's not thrilled with your arrival .
with grandpa , it 's different .
he just loves telling stories .
so he 's happy that you 're coming .
besides , since injuring his leg , he 's been bored stiff .
listen , i must teach you a phrase in " patois , " and you will repeat it to him .
oh , gustou , beni fara monegue . say it .
oh , gustou , beni fara monegue .
we don 't have much time for you to learn it .
we 're here . there 's the " oustaou . "
- go on , say the phrase .
- oh , gustou , beni fara monegue .
" allo pitchou " !
let me look at you .
you have your father 's eyes . come on in !
i prepared a snack for you .
you must be hungry after your trip .
here were are .
over here , it 's not like at victoria 's .
it will be a lot different than my daughter 's apartment .
there . you 'll see .
we can be quite comfortable here , too . sit over here .
we 'll get you something to eat . here .
this will be your pocket knife .
you must give a coin in return .
it 's the custom .
- will this do , tonton ?
it 's not for the money .
it 's to preserve friendship .
you 're grandma isn 't here .
she 's picking mushrooms .
and a bit of water , of course !
well , then ?
- how is it , good ?
- victor , where are you ?
see that door , it 's your room .
you can put your things .
will you show him how to forge ?
yes , you can watch me smith iron .
and if you 're not too tired , you can give me a hand .
see you later , tonton .
i say , you look a bit pale to me .
don 't worry , here you 'll soon get back your color .
here comes grannie .
victor didn 't warn you ? she 's a bit of a grouch .
she doesn 't like kissing very much .
give grandma a hug , olivier .
careful ! dummy , you 'll make the mushrooms tip over .
- we 're in for a treat tonight !
- no . you 'll have to wait until sunday .
so ?
the producers ?
i think she thinks that i could 've been trying to scare her , play a sick joke on her .
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person .
for all i know , johnny took it .
( carolina ) johnny took it ?
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
i don 't know .
( carolina ) oh , now johnny does everything ?
not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
hopefully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here .
i don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
why are you always defending him ?
why are you always defending him ?
i 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
you need to watch yourself !
i 'm kind of baffled where it 's gone , you know , ' cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
it would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
it 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
got some traps set up along this way somewhere .
i found some deer trails i scouted earlier .
hope they catch something .
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome , actually .
had a nice little fire .
weather was nice .
you know , wrapped up .
it was nice being on my own .
it 's what i wanted to do originally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and i got that , so pretty content .
what the hell did this , man ?
this thing 's ...
i mean , it , obviously , it ripped the deer while it was standing here .
it was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
( crack )
what do you want ?
what are you doing ?
( johnny ) i 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
what do you want ?
i just came to try to convince you to come back .
( johnny ) try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
yeah , i don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
i think it 's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accusations .
just , whatever happened , i don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here .
well , you know what ?
i really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
i 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
i can take care of myself .
y 'all try taking care of yourselves , too , all right ?
( carolina ) okay , fine .
if that 's how you want to be , then fine .
( johnny ) fine .
nah , that 's-- that 's not good enough .
that ain 't good enough .
( daniel ) hey , irene .
hey , dan .
whatcha doing ?
collecting some acorns .
- oh .
- yeah .
if you mash them up , you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it .
- really ?
- yeah .
is it-- does it taste good ?
i think so .
you want me to help ?
oh , sure .
that 'd be great . yeah .
they 're kind of scattered all over .
daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit ,
i guess you can say .
hey .
it 's a siberian squill .
( irene ) i 'm not really big on flowers .
why not ?
well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower ' cause it 's like , " oh , you know , i like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
it never really made sense to me .
( chuckles )
something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
( daniel ) she 's got so much complexity to her , you know ?
i find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that i would 've never expected out of her .
it 's ... ( chuckles )
she 's just-- she 's amazing .
( both chuckle )
where are we ?
i can 't find the path .
we 're lost .
- we 're not lost .
- no , we 're lost .
i don 't know where we 're going .
( miljan ) in the middle of the wood , very close to the river ,
i found this really weird-looking tree .
i mean , it wasn 't a tree .
it was something different .
it had a face shape .
it had hair .
what ?
my name is miljan .
it 's really nice to meet you . ( chuckles )
what is your name ?
ogdee ?
( laughs )
this is my friend ogdee .
we go way back , man .
( laughs )
he 's so bad .
i spoke to it .
we had a little conversation .
ogdee is my old friend from high school .
( laughs )
i 'm kidding .
- ( man ) esther .
esther .
- what ?
( esther ) hey .
where have you been ?
out .
out ?
where do you go all day , anyway ?
( whispering ) okay .
i can 't believe you got us so lost .
we 're not lost .
yes , we are .
where are we ?
do you know where we are ?
we 're in siberia .
not funny .
oh , god !
what is that ?
did you hear that ?
i heard it .
come on .
there might be something out here .
come on .
oh !
oh , god !
what are you doing out here ?
sorry .
i 'm going to get water .
where are you going ?
home-- where the hell is it ?
that way .
why is she being such a bitch ?
why are you here , by the way , alone ?
no reason .
uh-huh .
that 's suspicious .
( annie ) shut up , miljan .
( chuckles )
( neeko ) guys , have you seen carolina ?
( sam ) no .
she hasn 't come back .
you mean she 's not back yet ?
she 's not back .
i have no idea where she is .
i haven 't seen her .
you do know she 's out there with johnny ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i know .
well , i don 't know about you , but i feel like i should go and look for her .
i don 't-- i don 't feel comfortable with her with johnny .
( sam ) before it gets too late , i think we should .
i 'm game , yeah .
( neeko ) - you 're gonna come with me ?
- yeah .
( miljan ) gentlemen .
where the hell were you ?
i was in the woods .
have you seen carolina ?
( neeko ) she 's out there with johnny .
( miljan ) oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- come on .
- are you serious ?
( miljan ) yes .
they 're probably having sex or something .
oh , you 're a funny guy .
don 't be naive . you didn 't notice the chemistry they had ?
( neeko ) hey , guys , listen .
i 'm gonna look for her .
i don 't know about you .
just sitting here talking .
( miljan ) hey , it 's dark outside .
( rumbling )
oh , fuck !
( neeko ) get on the bed .
get onto the bed !
the bed ?
( miljan ) oh , my god .
what is this ?
the cab started shaking ...
ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that i 've never seen in my life , and i 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
what is it ?
it 's like-- it 's like the sky 's on fire .
what ?
it 's like the sky 's on fire .
( daniel ) the sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like victoria said .
if this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
i don 't understand how they could pull it off .
( sam ) i feel like i 'm on another planet .
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and nobody-- nobody has any answers .
i don 't have an answer .
i could sit here all day long and just-- it 's way above my pay scale .
- is it moving ?
- it just keeps moving .
carolina never came back today , did she ?
( woman ) yeah .
where-- where are they ?
( miljan ) she 's still in the woods-- the forest .
well , this can 't stop us .
we still have to find her .
we can 't leave her out there .
we better go now .
we 're just gonna go look for her-- me and sam , daniel , miljan as well .
oh , my god .
carolina ?
carolina .
are you okay ?
( indistinct shouting )
( woman ) what happened ?
oh , my god .
carolina !
- what happened ?
are you okay ?
- are you okay ?
then we see carolina stumbling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rushing over to her .
are you hurt somewhere ?
- ( sam ) what happened ?
- ( woman ) look at all the blood .
what happened ?
she 's bleeding .
guys , don 't , don 't-- don 't go to her .
oh , my god , look at her arm .
look at her arm .
( sam ) what happened to you ?
you 're okay .
( neeko ) carolina , what happened ?
( daniel ) carolina shows up , and she 's battered and disoriented .
she couldn 't even speak .
she 's trembling .
( carolina ) i don 't ...
she doesn 't remember .
- ( woman ) you don 't remember ? - ( carolina cries )
( sam ) what do you remember ?
( natalie ) she didn 't know what was going on .
she was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
she was just talking nonsense , and it was really jolting to see her come back like that .
_
( woman ) you were with john ?
- ( sam ) and what happened ?
- ( woman ) where is he ?
what were you doing with johnny ?
get her some water .
get her some help .
( neeko ) carolina , were you with johnny ?
( sam ) she said she was .
what were you doing with johnny ?
( neeko ) she said the name " johnny . "
at that point , i just , you know , lost it .
listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
( neeko ) for what ?
here , just come here .
come here .
i want to say something to you .
- what ?
- listen to me !
it 's important .
you got to make sure .
you look at his hands .
( neeko ) okay .
his hands are a tell-tale sign , okay ?
his hands will tell you if he did something .
( daniel ) what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
stay here with the girls .
stay here with the girls !
( neeko ) i 'm not wasting any more time with this guy .
everyone wants to keep him around , thinking ,
" oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
no , i don 't think so .
i 'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- she 's been through a lot .
- yeah .
we 're gonna look after you , okay ?
don 't worry .
( esther ) we don 't know where johnny is .
carolina sort of-- she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and johnny were fighting .
and then , now she looks like this , so johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because sam and neeko went after him .
let 's just keep moving .
( rustling )
move .
move .
_
( rustling continues )
the whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that , you know--
we stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
it 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
i haven 't slept very well , you know .
so i 'm just-- you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
you always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
i don 't know .
( animal screeches )
well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
( rustling )
yes .
you keep saying " he , " " he . "
look how thick the brush is here .
if there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
we hear other things .
all of a sudden , something goes flying .
i think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
i 'll go see if the water 's boiled .
thank you .
( natalie ) i don 't want to die .
i didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show , and every day that i 'm here ,
i feel like i 'm an idiot for staying , that i am gonna end up like tommy .
( cries )
i don 't deal well with-- abuse is not something that ...
i can handle right now .
i 'm scared .
( daniel ) and johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food .
i just-- how could he do that to her ?
it didn 't make sense .
she 's such a nice lady .
( footsteps )
johnny .
hey .
what did you do ?
- huh ?
- what did you do to carolina ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
what do you mean you don 't know what i 'm talking about ?
- what 'd you do to her ?
- i didn 't--
she 's all cut up and shit .
i don 't-
- i don 't know .
i ...
what 's wrong with you ?
i don 't know . i just-
- i kind of came to .
i was walking around , and ...
i don 't know .
i was- - i saw her .
you saw her where ?
you got to tell me what happened .
we were in the woods , and ...
i don 't really-- i don 't really remember .
i get approached by daniel , and basically started accusing me of hurting carolina .
i didn 't know what to say .
( natalie ) what did you to do her ? !
the last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
i don 't .
( natalie ) then what happened to her ?
i don 't know .
that 's not a very good answer right now , man .
i don 't-- trust me .
that 's not a very good answer .
( indistinct shouting in distance )
hey .
you hear that ?
at the camp .
let 's go .
i don 't know .
are you serious ?
you don 't know ?
you 're such a scumbag .
oh , what ?
so she just fell down and ended up that way ?
are you kidding me ?
i was in a complete haze .
i had no recollection .
i was like blacked out , like i drank too much .
( daniel ) he doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on .
( johnny ) i don 't .
- then what happened to her ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
i don 't know .
( woman ) you were together , weren 't you ?
- you said that .
- shit !
neeko !
neeko !
( indistinct shouting )
( daniel ) guys , he doesn 't know !
( neeko )
- motherfucker !
( daniel )
- come on !
stop it !
- ( carolina ) stop !
stop it !
- ( neeko ) come on !
stop it !
neeko , stop it !
he didn 't do it !
carolina starts screaming , " it 's not him .
he didn 't do it . "
stop it !
what do you mean ?
you said you don 't remember .
you said you don 't remember .
( neeko ) you 're a dead man .
you 're a fucking dead man .
( daniel ) listen .
listen .
hey , hey .
hey !
calm down .
listen .
- what happened ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
talk to me .
i don 't know .
johnny doesn 't know anything ?
he doesn 't remember anything .
it was just her and him in the forest .
i know that .
i know that .
i saw it in his eyes , okay ?
all i remember is i talked to her .
we were arguing .
and then i-i came here , and i started getting accused , and i don 't even know what the fuck is going on .
( sam ) if we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
when i saw that look in his eyes ,
i just felt that i needed to take a step back .
remember the way she came into camp ?
he 's got the same look on his face .
( johnny ) does she remember anything ?
( woman ) show us your hands .
( woman ) ( gasps )
( natalie ) oh , yeah .
i 've seen that before .
( woman ) what 's that from ?
( sam ) nothing 's making sense here .
and just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
we can 't go killing each other .
we 're still human beings .
( hiss )
( talking indistinctly )
( birds chirping )
i don 't like things that i can 't explain and that i don 't have at least some sort of control over .
the sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers , the show can 't do that .
we 're talking supernatural stuff now .
regardless of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
( johnny ) it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her .
i 've never hit a woman in my life .
i don 't know why i would .
i don 't remember anything , but ...
i can 't say that i didn 't ' cause i don 't--
i don 't know what happened .
but i know in my heart i wouldn 't do that .
( carolina ) i don 't remember anything .
all i remember is that i was ... with--
went to get johnny .
he was in the woods .
i found him , and i ...
it 's all one big blur , like one big blackout .
i have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and i don 't remember .
i don 't understand .
so you 're telling me this is real .
( sabina ) yes .
it looks like it 's native , handmade .
it looks like it 's just a prop to me .
well , if it 's a prop , it 's really well-made ' cause you see the barbs .
they 're curved .
that 's exactly how it should look .
this is ox .
it 's real ox .
and it 's balanced for throwing .
it just looks perfect .
it 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
i don 't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true , what is not .
i have to know the environment i 'm in .
i have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
look at this .
so , i found this symbol that is really strange .
it has four lines and little triangles on the ends .
then i found another one and another one , and i realized it 's a path .
i should follow them .
at the end , it was very close to the settlement .
i found the last one .
and i found this box .
it was a metal box .
i opened it , and it was a book .
i didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
i would assume it 's russian because it 's cyrillic letters .
( miljan ) in the middle of me looking at it , somebody was watching at me .
it was a person .
he 's staring at me .
and he just disappeared in a second .
so there are people out there .
hey .
i was just gonna try and make things better , and , like , apologize , and just wanted to let her know that i didn 't , you know ,
i didn 't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her .
i guess i was in a weird mood , and i just want to apologize because i don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because i 'm really glad you 're--
( natalie ) when i realized what annie 's real feelings were for me ,
i just thought ...
" i 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
so i kissed her .
( chuckles )
which i kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
( laughs )
don 't worry about it .
hey .
hey .
can i have a seat ?
how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
you ?
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing ' cause i knew she had scratches and stuff on her , and she was sure freaked out like i was .
( carolina ) do you remember anything from last night ?
no .
i don 't remember a thing .
i don 't remember anything either .
but i know you didn 't hurt me .
i would never hurt you .

( johnny ) can i ask you something , though ?
why 'd you set me up ?
with the shed and the food ?
she couldn 't even look me in the eye .
and i was like , " well ... "
i was like , " it tells me all i need to know , "
so i was like-- got the hell out of there .
johnny .
johnny .
( spanish ) stop , please .
johnny , wait for me .
- give me a break . ( spanish ) oh , my god . - ( daniel ) hey .
i know that .
i know that .
- johnny .
- i know that .
you 're an actress .
she said , like , this slogan .
like , " i know that .
i know that from somewhere . "
and then it just-- the light bulb went off .
yeah , that 's like your slogan .
she 's that actress from that show that--
i 'm like , " that 's how i know you . "
i didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't want-
- i asked them .
you didn 't want to do what ?
i didn 't want to burn it down .
i didn 't want to set you up .
they told me to .
who 's they ?
the producers .
so you 're-- you 're helping the show ?
- mom , may i please go to the toilet ?
david !
it 's me .
olivier ! what are you doing here ?
you thought you were going to america without me ?
you 're coming with us ?
wow ! i 'm so happy !
- but how can we do it ?
- don 't worry , i planned everything .
i have my health card .
i even pinched some money from jean and elodie ... for the train .
see , i still have some left .
you can 't pay the boat fare with that .
i 'll try to get hired as a cabin boy , or a dishwasher .
or hide with you as a stowaway .
i saw that in a movie .
i 'll feed you .
in america , samuel will help me cross the border .
now that you 're an orphan , my parents could adopt you .
oh yeah !
that would be swell .
we 'd be brothers !
come on .
let 's go see my parents .
wouldn 't it be better to meet on the boat ?
but no . they 'll be really happy to see you .
they were awfully worried .
isaac !
olivier !
what are you doing here ?
is elodie with you ?
no . she doesn 't know i 'm coming with you .
coming with us ?
now what is this all about ?
we could take him to america .
but these children are utterly out of their minds !
olivier , we would gladly take you if we could , but we 're not your parents .
we can adopt him !
david , look .
we can 't just adopt someone .
and then , olivier has a family , an aunt who has the means to give him a good education .
i don 't want to go to aunt victoria 's .
she 's a cow ! listen .
once we get to havre , i 'll call elodie .
i 'll buy a ticket for your return , and she 'll come ... pick you up at the saint-lazare station .
i can 't !
i pinched money from her to take the train .
no .
it 's okay .
i will explain ... and she 'll understand .
if he can 't come with us , then i 'm staying with him .
isaac , tell them it 's not possible !
listen , olivier ...
we understand your sorrow but please , be reasonable .
no . it 's not true .
you understand nothing !
you only think of yourself !
no , olivier .
olivier , wait for me !
i 'm coming with you !
david , come back !
hurry david , hurry up !
children , come back !
ouch !
my leg !
- i got one . - olivier !
it wasn 't my son who pulled the alarm .
it was a friend who wanted to come with us .
he 's all alone . you must find him !
- come here , david .
- i 'll see what i can do .
i don 't want to go with you .
david !
come back , kid .
what happened ?
a kid pulled the alarm .
he ran away .
you should put a flare on the track for the next train .
we don 't have time .
olivier !
olivier !
olivier !
david !
david !
david .
- where are you 're going , boy ?
paris ?
that 's pretty far off !
i had planned to take the train .
i 'm going to paris as well . i 'll take you .
besides , i don 't like traveling alone , so we 'll be doing each other a favor .
agreed ?
anyone in the back ?
no . i 'm going back empty .
- so , okay .
- where in paris do you live ?
i 'm not from paris , i 'm from the hill .
a real urchin , hey .
your parents just let you go ?
yeah .
my parents are really cool .
they trust me .
okay .
get in .
- so ?
- so .... so ...
zilch .
nothing .
the police have issued an apb .
zober was the last to see him .
since then , not a trace .
and that 's not all !
they want to fine him for pulling the alarm .
and for the money he 's stolen ?
- did you tell them ?
- no .
i 'm waiting for them to find him .
i hope he didn 't do anything stupid .
him ? what do you think !
just wait . he 'll get what 's coming to him .
i want him out of here .
he 's a sack of shit !
- listen .
- i don 't want to hear it !
i 'll kick his ass straight to the reformatory !
anybody here ?
what is it ?
what do you want , lad ?
i 'd like to talk to mr. privat .
he should be here .
no . he 's at home now , in auvergne .
can i call him ?
my mother often called him from here .
so you are the son of mrs. chateauneuf ?
everyone is looking for you , even the police .
- i beg you .
i must talk to him .
it 's important .
i 'll call .
good evening , miss .
could you ring number 3 at saugues , please .
it 's in haute-loire .
you won 't tell the cops , eh ?
hello ?
mr. privat ?
excuse me . this is hotel du cantal .
i have mrs. chateauneuf 's son here .
he wants to talk to you .
i 'll put him on .
hello .
mr. privat ?
yes , this is olivier .
you must help me . i did something stupid .
i ran away and stole money from elodie .
i 'm really scared .
yes .
yes , okay .
thank you .
i 'll put him on .
hello , mr. privat ?
yes .
good .
see you tomorrow morning .
come with me .
you 'll sleep here .
olivier !
olivier !
hello !
wake up .
- good morning .
- good morning , sir .
this breakfast should give you a boost .
thank you .
but first ... i must tell you what happened .
don 't worry .
i know all about it .
everything 's been sorted out .
i 've already been to the police station and have spoken to elodie .
she 's waiting for you .
- she 's glad you 're in good health .
- she won 't send me to reform school ?
nothing of the sort .
everyone knows what you 're going through right now .
elodie even has a surprise for you .
come on , eat up .
then we 'll go see her .
okay , sir .
this is so good !
i 'm coming !
olivier , i 'm so glad to see you .
you 're okay ?
- you 're not too tired ?
- no , no .
i 'm fine .
i 'm fine .
elodie ... i wanted to apologize .
for the money and for the scare i 've given you .
you know , we all make mistakes .
it wasn 't too serious .
and we understand you .
without your mom , and also with david 's departure ...
this is why mister privat and we decided to make you a big surprise .
what is it ?
you 'll go with him to saugues .
you 'll see , there you 'll be very , very happy .
you 'll have a big bedroom all to yourself .
you 'll learn to ride a horse .
and then the mountain air , there 's nothing better for a child !
and i don 't live far from your grandparents .
you can see them when you want .
and there 's also a very good school .
your studies will be better there .
what does aunt victoria say ?
she wouldn 't let me see you !
who does she think she is ?
it 's none of her business .
well , don 't stand there .
sit down , mr. privat .
after all , it was your mother 's idea , to go with mr. privat .
if you want to , of course .
when 's that gonna be ?
well , today .
you see , i finished packing your suitcase .
so you can catch the 2 pm train .
you 'll see , you 'll be better off there than here .
- why so fast ?
- aunt victoria could make trouble .
trouble ?
yes . by law i don 't have the right to take you .
i 'll have a lawyer if necessary .
i 'll say that it was your mother 's wish and yours as well .
don 't you worry olivier .
you 'd only get miserable here .
there are too many memories .
i wonder if i have time to say goodbye to mado .
you and your mado , i tell you !
better hurry , you don 't want to miss the 2 pm train .
get on with it .
olivier !
i 'm so happy to see you .
you gave us such a scare !
when did you get back ?
this morning .
- well , come in !
- no , no .
i came to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
yes .
i 'm going to auvergne with a friend of my mother 's .
it may be the best for you .
olivier !
- hurry up !
- yes .
i 'm coming !
i 'll have to go .
by the way ...
i just wanted to tell you that ...
i 'll never forget you .
goodbye , olivier .
- don 't forget to write me !
- yes , mado .
hey , artilleryman !
hitting the road without saying goodbye ?
yeah . i 'm going to auvergne .
give my regards to the volcanoes !
- okay .
- right , shall we go ?
where you 're going with that suitcase ?
well , i 'm leaving .
- for long ?
- i don 't know .
maybe for good .
don 't forget me too fast , okay ?
come on , oliver .
come .
olivier !
olivier .
i made you some pancakes .
i know you like them so much .
you can eat them on the train .
you were always so sweet .
don 't change too much over there .
okay , i 'll leave you here because ... farewells makes me too sad .
olivier , it 's for your own good , you know that don 't you ?
come on , give me a kiss .
now don 't you worry .
i 'll see you soon .
- thank you , mr. privat .
- goodbye . let 's go .
i say , you 're a real celebrity around here .
have you ever been to saugues , before the funeral ?
no , sir . never .
call me andre .
gare d 'orsay .
get in .
no . i can 't .
i can 't .
what 's the matter ?
i can 't leave my street .
it 's not because of you , but i want to stay here .
- why did you call me , then ?
i thought ... - i know .
it 's my fault .
but i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave bougras , mado ,
capdeverre , loulou ...
i don 't even want to leave i 'araignee .
don 't worry , olivier .
i understand completely .
we will do what you want .
anyway , think about it .
if you need me , write me .
well , goodbye .
olivier !
what 's going on ?
where is mr. privat ?
well , he took a taxi .
how so ?
without you ?
i didn 't want to leave .
what ? are you crazy ?
everything was arranged !
i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave my friends .
and you , of course .
you think you 're gonna stay with us ?
we can 't afford it , you know that !
if that 's the way it 's going to be , i 'll inform aunt victoria .
and the family council will have to decide .
henri , i 'm counting on you .
you will be firm .
as usual , my dear .
wow , check out this tin can !
can you believe this ?
it 's slick .
- really snazzy !
- hey , get away from there !
here we are !
- hello , henri .
- hello , jean .
ah , here 's our little adventurer .
- hello , elodie .
- hello .
you 'll be able to brag about the awful fright you gave us .
oh yes !
you can say that again !
- hello .
- hello .
as you know , the haberdashery has been sold .
i gathered for you some of your mother 's things , olivier .
there are some personal items , souvenirs , photos of your father , - and several school notebooks .
- thanks , aunt .
it 's only natural , olivier .
your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will receive .
say uncle , what is a guardian ?
it means i am responsible for you .
- as if you were my father ?
- yes , something like that .
come one , sort these out in your room .
what 's a family council ?
well , the family gathers to determine what is best for your future .
why can 't i listen to what 's being said ?
because that 's the way it is .
go , please leave us .
take it .
go .
please , let 's sit down and talk .
what do you plan on doing with him ?
us , what do you mean ?
it 's up to you to take him . you 're his aunt .
i 'm only his cousin , and a distant one at that .
come on . i 'm sure we can find a solution together .
one obviously comes to mind .
yes . the orphanage .
that might be a little harsh .
we had something else in mind .
if we wanted to honor virginie 's wishes , it would be up to m. privat to take care of him .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again :
- it is out of the question .
he 's an ex-convict , remember that .
what would the people say in saugues ?
what would they think of us ?
besides , the kid doesn 't want that .
how would you know ?
i suppose i can tell you , now .
on the day he returned from his fugue , he called privat at his estate .
i thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him .
unfortunately , at the last minute , he decided he wanted to stay with us .
if i understand correctly , you decided this without our knowing .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
it would have suited everyone .
i 'm not of that opinion .
but , since you deemed it unnecessary to consult me , it 's because you don 't recognize my right .
it 's up to you to take care of him .
besides , his world is here .
in our milieu , he would be all confused .
that 's it , victoria .
you 're too good for your brother 's son .
i didn 't say that .
no need to be so offensive .
unquestionably , you can 't deny ... that olivier has spent all of his life on this street .
his school and his friends are here .
besides , at this moment , with my son coming down with tuberculosis , have you thought of the risk of contagion ?
yes , of course i have .
how are we going to feed him ?
- we 're already struggling .
- and this apartment is too small .
i could help you .
temporarily , of course .
well in that case , maybe we could keep him .
we would need ...
i don 't know ... 150 francs a month .
- what ? half of that would be plenty .
that just wouldn 't be enough .
but we will make an effort until the end of the school year .
after that , we won 't be able to .
you do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon .
elodie , you 've been chanting that for the last 2 years .
how can you say that , victoria !
- i didn 't mean to offend you .
- that 's too easy ! jean , tell her to get out of here !
now , now , precious , victoria has apologized .
implying that we 're only good at making babes with tuberculosis , that takes the cake !
i will not stay here one second longer .
- let 's go , henri .
- no . wait for me in the car .
what a mess !
especially since we agreed to a settlement .
henri , i would think that with 115 ... okay , let 's say 110 , we could make ends meet . come now , let 's not negotiate again .
our proposition stands at 100 .
if that doesn 't work out , we can always discuss it further .
- so let 's start with 100 .
- here is the first month 's .
- goodbye , henri .
- yes , goodbye .
elodie .
elodie , open the door , please .
ah , you !
you could have taken my side at least !
they were ready to give us 100 francs . i wasn 't going to mess with that .
lucky for us , i patched things up !
you call that patching things up ?
you know it won 't be enough .
i told you , we need at least 130 franc .
if i work for the rest , maybe i can stay ?
you know the answer is yes .
you 're eavesdropping .
but not for long . but why ?
because you 're a pain , that 's why .
all you care about is whether you can stay or not !
look at you .
you 're yelling at the kid , yet in front of victoria , you can 't grow a pair !
you ... looks like you 're courting back luck .
i got it , i got it !
" dear david ,
" it 's been 6 weeks to this day since your departure .
" i have no news from you , which means you 're probably busy ,
" as well as your parents . "
hey , olivier , you coming ?
we 've made our own wading pool .
now , let me give you some advice .
come play with us instead of wasting ink ...
- on a guy who 'll never answer you .
- would you leave me alone , loulou ?
come on , loulou !
i 'm coming !
glazier !
glazier !
so , artilleryman , you still here ?
why the sad face ?
david is gone .
i have no news of him .
i can 't stay with my cousins .
i would have to somewhat earn my keep .
you could always help me with my chores , right ?
you 'll see , earning your keep isn 't that hard .
and if you ask me , you shouldn 't waste your time like this , staring for hours at your mother 's old boutique .
that won 't bring her back , you know .
i know it 's not fair .
and with your best friend gone .
you feel abandoned .
but friends ... you still have quite a few around here .
and you 'll make new ones .
see , look at your buddies .
you have to open up , olivier .
you understand ?
come on , olive !
no bad feelings !
go on , go !
come on , we 're having a splash !
hurry up , for god 's sake !
aren 't you done yet wasting this water ... with your stupid games ?
- bunch of gutter-puppies !
- we 're doing nothing wrong .
" nothing wrong " ?
what if there 's a fire , where would the water come from ?
come on , mr. gastounet , have you never been young ? children should have fun .
what right have you , madame ?
i have no lessons to learn from a .... from a hooker .
are you afraid you might get hooked , mr. gastounet ?
i think i could teach you a few things .
let 's stop there .
i have nothing to say to you .
you started it , old fart .
she really nailed you , gastounet !
you anarchist , i have nothing to say to you .
and you ? who do you think you are , you old grinch .
we 're not about to stop the children from having fun !
taking the moral high ground instead of sweeping his own porch .
what a sourpuss !
- how 's the work coming downstairs ?
- very well , very well .
- bougras says we 'll be done by 5 .
- good .
that 's very good .
here you go , two cheese sandwiches .
enjoy . thank you very much .
ah ... there 's i 'araignee .
thanks .
good day , sir , you okay ?
no , i 'm not okay .
the salvation army and soup kitchen close in the spring .
i 'm hungry . artilleryman !
where are my sandwiches ?
coming , coming !
good lord , a nice shot of red and a cheese sandwich .
the only 2 things worth living for !
hey , hey ... easy there little feller .
i offer for the taste , not to guzzle .
if you 're thirsty , drink water .
would you like a fag , monsieur bougras ?
ernest gave them to me .
oh no . bougras , he always sticks to the pipe .
say , monsieur bougras ...
why do you have a beard ?
it 's to hide the ugly mug underneath !
now then , back to work !
look here , i think you 're filling them up too much .
you trying to get me sloshed ?
- see you , ernest .
- see you !
well , my cellar rats ?
mission accomplished , boss !
but there are 3 bottles that are a bit cloudy .
that 's normal , it 's the bottom of the barrel .
you can have them .
not a bad lot , but i can 't sell them .
- good . now , we agreed on 25 franc ?
- yes , that 's it .
- here , then .
- thanks .
here , this is for you .
ten francs ?
but it 's too much , mr.bougras .
didn 't you say you needed extra dough to help your cousin ?
and to top it off , here 's an eggplant for suppertime .
here .
- but why ?
- it 's not for your work ,
i owed your mother money , but i forgot .
you can check the ledgers , it 's all in writing .
in that case , thanks !
that should help with your keep .
your cousin will probably want you to stay , now .
- what can i get you ?
- anything you want , except red .
nothing for me , i have errands .
- so long , ernest .
so long , bougras .
- so long , kid ! - how about white wine ?
- can 't say no to that .
that must be him !
you know how late you are ?
where were you ?
- we started without you .
- forgive me , elodie .
- good lord , you 're reeking of wine !
- and what 's this ?
a leg of veal !
leg of veal ?
- you didn 't steal it i hope ?
- no . no . i 've been working with bougras at the transatlantique .
in that case , that 's really nice of you .
i even brought you some wine , jean .
beaujolpif ?
let 's have a swig !
- would you like a bit ?
- sure i would .
- so , how is it ?
- not bad , not bad .
excellent , yeah !
see ? he 's not a bad kid , after all .
we would keep you if we were rich , you know .
no worries . i could stop going to school .
i could scrounge a bit more with bougras .
i would earn more money and help you out .
don 't be stupid , olivier !
you think your mom would approve of you turning into a street urchin ?
you don 't want to go to school , anymore ?
end up as a drop-out like bougras ?
if i could have stayed longer in school , we wouldn 't be here today .
he 's right . you 're lucky to have your aunt victoria .
- we 're too young .
- and you don 't want me around .
that 's not true .
don 't say that ..
but taking care of you is a sacrifice .
if he had to work , people would say we 're exploiting him .
his aunt should take him in .
no ! you also said she 's a cow .
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , you 'll still go to school .
alright , jean .
may i have some more ?
you certainly have an appetite this evening .
i 'm flattered .
here you go !
thanks , elodie .
look at this scoundrel .
no wonder his plate emptied so fast !
show me your napkin .
it 's for a kitten .
a kitten ?
you think we 're stupid ?
no , i swear it !
a kitten eating potatoes ?
that 'll be the day !
come on , give it to me .
no , wait !
don 't throw it out !
why not ?
you 'll see .
go ahead , put it in .
that way , we 'll have an hour or two to ourselves .
yes , you 're right .
here you go , olivier .
go feed that kitten of yours .
- thanks , jean .
- alright , scram .
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
and you turn off the light .
very well .
see you tomorrow , elodie !
- no funny stuff , okay ?
- don 't worry .
your vest !
thanks .
elodie ...
i think we 're too soft on him .
the longer he stays the more he gets attached .
you think i 'm not getting attached ?
what are you doing here ?
thanks , kid .
smells good !
it was better when it was hot .
it 's veal with potatoes .
good , huh ?
delicious .
i 'll eat it later .
i also have a fag .
i 'm in heaven !
that 's swell !
i have something for you .
it 's an anthology on the language of flowers .
i didn 't know flowers could talk .
not on their own , of course .
if a man offers one to a woman , it speaks without making a sound .
each flower has its own meaning .
that is the language of flowers .
hey , olivier , want to join me ?
i 'm going to the basilica to see the night over paris .
i can 't go .
don 't you see i 'm chatting with my buddy ?
your loss .
girls ....
they 're such leeches .
you won 't always think that .
given that a laborer earns 35 franc per day , and works 48 weeks of 5 and half days each year , what could he set aside at the end of the year ?
a few beans , monsieur !
chateauneuf , bring to me whatever you are reading .
the language of flowers ?
we have a poet in our midst .
let 's see if you 've at least learned something .
what is , according to this leaflet , the meaning of ... the oak-leaf geranium ?
it symbolizes true friendship .
that is correct .
the white japanese camellia ?
perfect beauty .
- and the acacia ?
- elegance , monsieur .
you see , if you want , you 'd get better grades !
yes . yes .
- hello , mado .
- hello , olivier .
for me ?
oh , you shouldn 't have !
they are magnificent .
they didn 't cost me anything .
i went to the opening of les halles with bougras .
we gave a hand to a flower merchant .
red roses .
you know what it means when a man offers red roses to a woman ?
no , not at all .
it 's a statement of passionate love .
oh yeah ?
would you like a cup of tea ?
oh yeah ! i love tea , now .
here .
take it .
tell me , any news from your friend david ?
no .
and i wrote him so many letters .
don 't worry , i 'm sure you 'll get one soon .
i don 't care anymore .
i 'll make new friends .
that i am sure of .
now .
i must get dressed .
you stay here and finish your tea .
i just step into the other room .
i 'm keeping warm all over , my little heart is as white as a toad 's underbelly .
worries , i have but a few .
troubles , i couldn 't care less .
what 's gotten over you ?
i got promoted to film editor at pathe cinema .
really ? that 's swell !
you bet your ass !
i 'm starting on the newsreels , and after that i can work ... my way up to the big movies .
that dress i saw in the galeries , maybe we can afford it , now ?
elodie , i can see it right now over your shoulders .
and the tandem .
we 'll get the bike too . for our sunday outings !
oh yeah !
say !
maybe you can keep me now ?
if i have the means , olivier .
if i have the means .
you know , elodie is pregnant .
can you imagine ?
a baby and you in this tiny apartment ?
you 're expecting a baby ?
well , yes .
that 's neat !
when is it due ?
well , in 5 months .
you see , it still gives you some time .
anyway , i 'm really happy for you .
i forgot , olivier !
you must hurry .
mr. privat came to see you .
mr. privat ?
he 's in paris ?
yes , just a stopover .
he 's waiting for you at the marcadet palace to see a movie .
so go !
you gotta hurry .
don 't forget your vest !
when our teacher talks about the war , he never mentions any of this .
is that how it really was ?
far worse .
it was a slaughterhouse .
i shouldn 't have brought you to see this .
for a child , it 's too sad .
i remember a time .
papa would always say : " that fucking war . "
what was my dad like ?
i 've told you already .
you father and i were friends long before the war .
he was injured during the assault on the marne .
he wrote me saying they had captured lots of german soldiers ... completely drunk from guzzling too much champagne .
ours !
our champagne !
he got hurt two days later , during a counter- strike .
your dad was right :
" fucking war ! "
my mom would always answer him ... that it was thanks to the war they got married .
father was wounded and mother was the nurse , and that 's how it all started .
it 's a beautiful story .
yes , olivier .
it 's a beautiful story .
come on .
there 's bougras !
he 's a sandwich man , now ?
playbill ?
one for you .
get your playbill right here .
he 's my buddy .
i 'll introduce you .
hey , hey , my artilleryman , on vacation i see ?
enjoying the flick ?
good day , monsieur bougras .
i 'd like you to meet mr. privat . he was my mother 's best friend .
we just saw the wooden crosses .
it was well done .
in terms of bloodbaths , this one was well done , yes .
you got nothing better to do than take him to a war film ?
you shouldn 't say that .
mr. privat is a hero .
you 're nuts if you think that !
as if there were heroes in a war .
in a war there 're only victims and assassins .
how many krauts did he kill ?
ten ?
twenty ? fifty ?
that 's it ?
and today , we proudly sport medals !
what you really want is that he admires you .
wasn 't it enough to lose an arm ?
would it please you , if he also goes to war .
no , sir .
you 're wrong .
i wish he will never have to .
that 's what we fought for .
yeah , yeah , la-dee-da , la-dee-la !
yeah , i 've heard it before .
i know the tune .
you 'd better take him to luna park instead , to see charlie chaplin .
it would be funnier .
ah , what the fuck .
you make me sick .
- see you later , mates !
- wait ...
bougras ...
as for you , don 't bother me .
you 're a twit , just like the others .
i don 't ever want to see you .
good morning , monsieur bougras .
something wrong , olivier ?
no , i 'm fine .
it 's just that mr. bougras doesn 't want to see me anymore .
ah , i wouldn 't worry about it .
he 's a bit like me .
sometimes , we get angry at the whole world .
it comes and goes .
- want to do something for me ?
- yes , what ?
a shelf came down in my room .
no sweat . after school , i 'll fix it impeccable .
- see you later .
- see you later .
there .
just like new .
thank you , olivier .
here , could you place this on the shelf ?
sure .
oh , darn !
" the terrible fall of daniel . "
" daniel , king of the trapeze . "
" the terrible fall .
last night in paris , during his performance ...
" at the winter circus , the famous trapeze artist daniel ...
" fell 12 m to the ground . "
" daniel 's terrible accident . "
" unbelievable but true :
daniel still the best . "
do you know this daniel ?
he 's a buddy of yours ?
it was you ?
you were flying the trapeze ?
here , that was you ?
if you don 't mind , this stays between us .
but why ?
out of vanity .
you see , i still rather inspire fear than pity .
oh my , you sure have a lot of books !
oh , once i had many more .
i sold nearly all of them .
everyone has to eat .
what a shame .
i 've become attached to this neighbourhood , to this street .
i wouldn 't want to leave it and wind up in an old people 's home , even if i was better off , given my condition .
i understand you .
i don 't want to leave either .
and why would you ?
jean and elodie will soon have a baby .
when the baby is born , they won 't be able to keep me .
there might a way .
look , behind the cupboard . that 's your cousin 's place .
so that means i sleep right over there .
i say , that is funny !
here , i 'd like to give you a book .
not just any book , mind you .
it 's a bit thick , but once you 've read it , life and books will no longer hold secrets for you .
pretty heavy , hey ?
it 's the weight of knowledge .
" amouillante ,
" noun , feminine and adjective :
" cow ready to calve .
" amor ,
" latin word meaning love :
" physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another , "
" physical or emotional attraction of one person toward another . "
capdeverre .
five . and i went easy on you .
you obviously want to be a boxer , but it looks like ... you forgot to take your gloves off before starting your essay .
loulou .
zero .
not a bad piece , even funny at times .
however , gangster is not a profession .
if your ideals only tend toward dough , shooters and broads , you 'll hit the slammer faster than a jackrabbit .
chateauneuf .
why did your write your essay in verse ?
i don 't know , it 's more beautiful !
" he who pushes his talents accomplishes nothing with grace , " my child .
anyway , i do see the effort .
and in terms of vocabulary , you went the extra mile .
however ... i do ask myself , why do all of your aspirations start with the letter a ?
you contemplate becoming an : acrobat , architect , administrator , athlete , armorer , aviator , ambassador , astrologer , anthropologist ... and artistic lyricist .
careful not to spread yourself too thin .
i gave you an 8 .
it 's a little harsh , but see it as an encouragement .
ernest .
i would have liked to see you become as imaginative .
you 'd like to be a coffee-shop owner , like papa .
excuse me , mr. gastounet .
children , our country is facing hard times .
president doumer was shot down at noon today by a madman .
his situation is hopeless .
consequently , you will all go home to your parents .
and tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mourning .
- yeah !
all this will finish badly , very badly ...
and so , in this edition , we 'll follow the funeral of president paul doumer ... and the results of the legislative elections , and also the leftist swing in parliament .
so ... for doumer 's funeral , we went all out .
we have 7 cameras .
one at the entrance and exit of the elysee , and all along the procession route in paris .
this way , we 'll have a good assessment of the crowd : tens of thousands of mourners .
the assassin :
goryoulov .
it 's the only record we have .
we have no footage .
and we 'll end with the elections .
it 's familiar ground , but at least we 'll give out some results .
the left wins 91 seats .
lights !
that 's good .
it 's good , but i want everything ... you 've got on the assassination and funeral of doumer .
nobody cares about the elections .
especially since your footage is as dull as dishwater .
yes , you 're right .
sir , although the footage of doumer 's funeral is powerful , the real important event are the elections .
for the first time in many years , the left regained a majority !
young man , the people want to see something spectacular .
the face of charles lindbergh when told about the death of his son , or the skater sonia henie , or doumer on his death bed ; not what they read about 3 days before .
agreed . but we can 't downplay the upsurge by the left .
first of all , the left is not yet the ruling party .
second , learn to mind your own business .
oh , but it is my business !
i 'm a citizen just like you .
alright . we 'll see about that later .
you should have seen the way i nailed the producer today !
he didn 't even want to talk about the elections !
aren 't you 're not pushing your luck ?
you just started there . i know you with your big mouth !
oh , don 't get me started !
what do you call this ?
- it 's a surprise .
- really ?
who made this hole in the wall ?
don 't worry .
the landlord made it .
oh yeah ?
what for ? well , when the neighbour moved out , i told the landlord we needed more space for the baby .
- he had to study the wall 's integrity .
- did he say yes ?
yes . he 'll come to talk about raising the rent .
that would be fantastic !
we wouldn 't have to move to a larger flat .
right .
l 'araignee used to live here .
yes . this morning , he was taken to the old people 's home .
he asked to be taken .
he found it harder to get up the stairs .
we won 't see him anymore ?
well , one man 's loss is another man 's gain .
listen , before checking out , he left some books for you .
have a look .
- may i say something ?
- go ahead .
with this room , if i sleep here ... i 'll be less of a burden .
we want this to be the baby 's room .
i know , but in the meantime .
you , when your mind is set on something ...
alright , then .
until the baby is born , you can squat .
- yeah !
- and tomorrow , i 'll take you to the studio . you 'll work all day as an extra on a movie set .
look at that .
- what a beauty !
- it 's a delage .
last word of advice : when you 're on the set , and the red light is on , you gotta shut up .
- especially when you hear the clapper .
- understood . and never look in the camera .
let 's go say hello .
- good morning , fernand .
- jean , i need to talk to you . the kid 's an extra for the day . i 'm taking him now on the set .
jean , it 's not about the kid .
it 's about you . you can 't go in anymore .
you 're joking , right !
no , i 'm not joking . they 're letting you go .
here 's you 're last pay .
i 'm fired ? just like that ?
i want to see a manager !
the boss is not here this morning .
come back this afternoon .
but i doubt they 'll change their minds .
well i won 't take this lying down .
they don 't know who they 're dealing with .
i 'm not going !
no . you must go .
we 'll take the other street and blend in with the extras .
- jean ! - don 't give me a rough time .
- but , jean !
why must you always talk about politics ?
how will we manage now with the landlord ?
we 'll have to pay for the hole .
i 'm sure we 'll find a solution .
did you see about getting your job back as a boom operator ?
yep . they already filled the position .
but that can 't be !
why must this be happening to us right now ?
here .
my wages for being an extra .
you can have it .
i hope it helps to pay for the baby 's room .
now there 's a repeat performance !
we 're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself .
you don 't care about us .
you just want to make sure you can live here ! no , jean .
that 's not true , i swear it .
i swear it !
you 're selfish !
hypocrite !
i don 't want your fucking dough !
listen ! i 'm out of action .
there 's no way we can support you .
get the hell out !
but , jean !
why did you tell him that ?
hey , kitty .
minou .
come back !
fire !
fire ! fire !
hey , where do you think you 're going ?
did you start this fire ?
you 're in big trouble you little brat !
- but i didn 't do anything , sir .
- and this , what do you call this ?
why did you start this fire , miserable arsonist .
- you 're parents will have to pay .
- they 're both dead .
you don 't get off that easy .
anymore tricks up your sleeve ?
leave him alone .
i know this kid . he 's the haberdasher 's orphan .
- he even stole from his cousins .
- he 's a hooligan .
- he belongs in a reform school !
- but i did nothing wrong !
c 'mon folks , what 's this : the apocalypse !
c 'mon , leave him alone .
this rapacious mutt just set fire to a dwelling of honest folks !
" honest folks ! " ha , ha !
show me half a dozen ! even one or two if you can !
have you never been a kid and done stupid things ?
c 'mon ! clear away !
c 'mon , hop on , kid !
c 'mon , c 'mon !
cheers , mates !
rise up , rise up !
the hour is near to start the revolt !
the hour is near to start the revolt .
yipper !
now my olive .
hang in there . it 's all over .
will i have to go to reform school ?
of course not . no reform school .
you 're with jean and elodie , you 're not alone .
as a matter of fact , jean lost his job .
- they can 't keep me anymore .
- shit . talk about bad luck .
i sure hope i 'araignee didn 't leave for nothing .
why do you say that ?
he made me swear i wouldn 't tell anyone , especially you .
he left his room for your benefit .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
he wanted you to stay .
so he arranged a meeting ... between elodie and the landlord .
but i didn 't want him to leave !
- tell me it 's not true .
- i 'm afraid it is .
that 's why you can 't go .
do you understand ?
c 'mon , artilleryman , we can 't lose hope , right ?
you 'll see , things will work out for jean .
and that little mishap with the fire , it 's nothing serious .
not at all ...
besides , nothing should be taken seriously .
- so you 're not angry with me anymore ?
- angry ?
- oh , it 's you .
- yep , it 's me . i forgot my keys .
elodie !
elodie . are you there ?
- no .
she 'll be back later tonight .
- what are you talking about ?
ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the transatlantique .
- but the transat is closed in the evening .
- no , no . it 's the annual dinner of the montmartre fellowship alumni .
it will end late .
and you , what 's new ?
nothing .
i 've been looking for work for over a month .
" sorry , sir , there is nothing . "
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
fucking crisis !
one of these days , the keg will blow !
the misers will still get away with it , but not for long !
they 'll get what 's coming to them !
we 'll make mincemeat out of them !
you hear me , olivier ?
look at what i prepared .
stuffed tomatoes !
- you made this ?
mother taught me how .
- i 'll get it , i 'll get it .
- no , stay here , i 'll get it .
- oh . it 's the charming mado !
- good evening , jean .
well , do come in , come in .
sorry to disturb you ...
i was supposed to go out with a girlfriend , but her mom fell sick .
- so i thought maybe you would like to ...
no .
not exactly .
i was thinking more about olivier ...
there is no school tomorrow , i promised to take him to the restaurant .
if that would make him happy .
right olivier ?
would you like to go out with mado ?
oh yes , jean .
thank you !
i won 't bring him back late .
i hope not !
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
here . i brought you a tie so you 'll look elegant .
thank you .
i 'll put it on right now . and some gomina gel .
alright , get a move on !
so ... everything arranged for tomorrow ?
you 're certain ?
yes .
at what time they 'll pick him up ?
at 2 pm . his uncle henri will pick him up .
poor kid ...
he 's doesn 't know yet ?
no .
it will be a terrible blow .
yes , i know .
anyway , thanks for taking him out tonight .
i really like him , you know .
i 'm ready !
oh , my . really classy , olivier !
monsieur will taste the wine .
ah , it is good , huh !
a little warm .
it is not warm , young man , it is ambient .
my friend bougras says the saint-emilion is better when brought up from the cellar .
would you have a bottle from the cellar ?
we do . but if i may , i would not recommend it .
but monsieur maurice !
if it 's madame 's wish , we get a bottle from the cellar .
and may madame and monsieur enjoy an excellent meal .
thank you .
lesson number 5 : the client is king .
forgive me , madame , or mademoiselle ... your face looks familiar .
i 'm sure we 've met before , but i don 't seem to remember .
- perhaps you can help me ?
- sir !
can 't you see i 'm with my fiance ?
and , bingo !
lesson number 6 :
never bother a lady if she hasn 't been introduced to you .
to draw her attention , have a garcon deliver a card .
or flowers .
- to our health !
- ah no . you must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me .
very well , mado .
you could then propose a toast , but not usually with the ladies .
was everything satisfactory ?
it was .... exquisite !
- i would like some sweet strawberries .
- and for the young man ?
how about a nice paris-brest ?
it 's very good .
- isn 't that a bicycle race ?
- no , it 's also a cake .
- sir , do you have plum pudding ?
- most certainly .
- let 's go for the plum pudding !
- very well , monsieur .
apparently , it 's as good as love .
i 'd like to thank you again , mado .
it was really ... really ... romantic !
- ah , i 'll give you back the tie .
- no .
keep it . you 'll have a souvenir of me .
a souvenir ?
but we 'll see each other soon .
that 's what i meant .
you can keep it forever .
alright .
so long , gentleman .
elodie !
elodie !
hello , ernest .
what did he say ? - nothing .
i didn 't tell him .
- what ?
you were supposed to tell him last night .
henri will arrive in half an hour .
but surely , we must tell him now .
i was wondering if we couldn 't keep him .
listen , jean , we 're not starting that again .
it 's not possible .
god knows when you 'll find a job .
and in 3 months i won 't be able to work because of the baby . i 'm sad too .
but that 's how it is . nothing we can do . elodie .
the order for no.4 ! be right there !
it 's coming .
bon appetit .
where is he now ?
he borrowed your fire cups to treat bougras .
well , you 're going to tell him right now .
almost done ?
- only two more to go .
- ah well , go for it .
firing up !
oh , my !
if you can heal me with those , i 'll buy you a drink .
mother would often treat me .
she said it 's better than medication .
okay , do the last one .
firing up !
ooh , that one 's really hot .
now all we have to do is wait .
come in !
greetings , bougras !
greetings , jean .
so , you 're playing doctor , now ?
he 's good at it too . my lord !
it 's gonna be a hot day .
does that surprise you ?
it is after all , the beginning of july .
you know , olivier , in life , there are events more serious than others .
but they shouldn 't lead us to over-dramatize .
everything works out .
all one needs is to show a little willpower .
isn 't that so ?
yes .
olivier , i want you to listen to me .
i have news to tell you .
don 't worry , it 's actually good news .
as you know , henri has become your legal guardian .
that means ... you 'll be like his son .
can you imagine just how lucky you are ?
don 't look so gloomy .
you know we did everything we could to keep you .
but in the long run , it 's for your own good .
from now on , you 'll live in a large apartment , with wall-to-wall carpets .
two housemaids .
two !
you 'll be able to go to college and get a real education .
not to mention , lucky dog , a summer vacation in touraine .
a few dozen hectares , apparently .
you 'll be living like a king !
we didn 't want to tell you sooner so as not to ... as not to ...
well , that 's it .
your uncle 's car should arrive soon .
you mean now ?
right now ? well , yes .
right now .
but couldn 't i go stay with privat instead ?
that , my boy , is your fault .
you had your chance .
now .
i go down to wait for the car .
i 'll let you know .
i gotta pack a suitcase .
no .
you won 't have to .
it 's already packed .
it 's at the transat .
so long , bougras .
take those yogurt jars off of me .
c 'mon , do it quick .
you 'll see , mr. bougras .
usually , if all goes well , in one hour , you should be feeling better .
i 'm sure i 'm will .
thank you , my lad .
you 've been a good nurse .
you took good care of me .
never mind that , i 'll put those away .
is olivier ready ?
now , now , artilleryman .
you 're not gonna start whining ?
you 're not a girl are you ?
no , mr. bougras .
c 'mon , then ...
let 's shake on it , for old time 's sake ?
it 's for me ?
i can 't take it .
it 's too nice .
i can 't .
there you go .
c 'mon , get out of here my olive .
c 'mon .
get out of here . scat !
go !
come on , olivier , you 're not saying goodbye ?
don 't worry , you 'll be like our son , now .
so long , olive .
you 're in luck .
take a load of this car !
goodbye , chateauneuf !
- see you soon , olivier !
- goodbye , olive !
you like mint lollipops , i think .
where are we going , uncle ?
your place ?
you know , we had a look at your school grades , you 'll need classes this summer to catch up .
the director was categorical .
the director ?
the director of the college where you will now further your studies .
it 's a good establishment . you 'll see .
and one of the best in churning out successful students .
marceau , our son , attended this college .
even got an award for latin in the main contest event .
how unfortunate he 's not as healthy as you !
your mother wanted you to get a good education .
ah ... here we are .
i 'll spend the entire summer here ?
but you 'll see , you 'll enjoy it here .
come , let 's go see the director .
say , how long are you staying in touraine , with your delage ?
my chauffeur is prudent , but still it 's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km .
all the same , it 's fantastic . what will they think of next ?
this will be your bed .
please remember to pass along my regards to your wife and to marceau .
- how is he ? - doing fine .
we hope to bring him home by the end of this summer .
however , with this illness , a sword of damocles always hangs above our heads .
i share your concerns .
- dear uncle , may i ... - two minutes .
olivier .
i hope you 'll be as bright as your cousin .
uncle , i need to use the toilet !
have you been following gorgoulov 's trial ?
it 's an abomination !
ah , is the child 's uniform ready ?
it 's the right size .
at least , i hope .
here you go my boy , try this on for me .
what 's the matter with you ?
he pissed himself !
- oliver ... what 's wrong with you ?
- never mind , i 'll take care of it .
come with me , you filthy little boy .
i beg your forgiveness , m. le directeur .
make nothing of it .
how long ago did his mother pass away ?
4 or 5 months .
i 'm worried we might have been a little hasty in all of this .
would you mind if i kept him for this evening ?
no , not at all .
i 'll try to cheer him up .
do you like to go see mayol , the singer ?
not really , uncle .
what then would please you ?
- i 'd love to go to the lapin agile .
- the cabaret in montmartre ?
that establishment does not allow children .
i used to go with my mother .
" parlez-moi d 'amour
" redites-moi des choses tendres
" votre beau discours
" mon coeur n 'est pas las de l 'entendre
" pourvu que toujours
" vous repetiez ces mots supremes "
it 's funny ...
the last time i was here with mama , we were sitting at this very table .
why ever would your mother bring you here ?
we came to dance .
tangos , especially .
olivier , are you crying ?
no .
it 's nothing .
we should not have come here .
it will only make you miserable . no .
on the contrary .
i 'm happy .
very happy .
careful , chateauneuf !
your uncle could have brought you back sooner .
go to bed now . go on .
that should teach you not to wake everybody up .
chateauneuf , don 't be a show-off .
i run a quiet dorm and it will stay that way .
we 're not in montmartre .
- but it wasn 't me , sir . - silence !
we don 't answer back , chateauneuf .
and now , go to sleep . everybody .
you 're a snitch , chateauneuf !
did you hear that ?
he 's from montmartre .
and already snitching on us !
no one talks to him .
he 's now on quarantine .
- yeah , good idea .
- silence !
hey urchin . you can 't play with us .
we don 't need you .
debezieux . well done : 16 / 20 .
saron , almost perfect .
once again , you 've earned 19 .
i kept the best for last .
no , chateauneuf did not get 20 .
after only 2 months , i wouldn 't expect as much from him .
luckily for him , there are no marks below zero , because chateauneuf would have scored -6.5 .
and for your enjoyment , i will demonstrate how chateauneuf ... translates the famous phrase :
" if you want peace
" prepare for war . "
you haven 't made any progress during the summer , chateauneuf .
being mr. desrousseau 's nephew or not , you are not exempt from being intelligent .
follow your cousin marceau 's example . he was my best student .
good morning , olivier .
i 'm marceau , your cousin .
we 've met at the house on a few occasions .
it 's pretty hard to forget .
my latin teacher never stops talking about you .
good morning , marceau .
no need to be formal , lad .
you 're a poet ?
we 'll understand each other !
" child of a fallen leaf ,
" subjected to every wind
" as the weeks and months of summer pass
" wrapped in the sheets of my friends ' solitude
" i call the names of bougras , mado , i 'araignee
" no answer to be heard . they have forgotten me .
" and so i ask :
what has become of them ?
" you , my parents as distant as strangers be
" what secrets have you not dared share with me ? "
not bad .
inspired by rutebeuf , and a bit of a tearjerker , but ... given your situation , this piece is fitting .
that poem is private !
perhaps i should teach you the finer aspects of caesura .
i don 't need your help .
couldn 't i be of use to you in latin ?
- what about your sister ?
- mind your own business .
i 'm starting to like you , obscure little friend .
i was afraid you would bore me .
my parents dumped you here for the whole summer ?
ah , the bastards !
they could have brought you with them to touraine at least !
i sympathize . i spent the last 8 months in the sanatorium .
i 'm cured , finally . i 'm just out and i bring you back home !
isn 't life beautiful ?
the headmaster will never consent .
you 're mother picks me up tomorrow .
nihil obstat .
i 've just seen the principal , and , between two latin quotes , i 've told him that my mother had instructed me to take you home . you are free .
i release you from the bonds of slavery .
long live freedom !
long live andre breton !
- who 's this breton ?
- the pope of surrealism , of course !
the pope of what ? my god !
i 'll need to tend to your education .
you are now entering the holy of holies .
you may enter .
you are familiar with this apartment ? yes .
i mean not that familiar .
you must always look impressed by the luxury ... of good standing that is the foundation of my parent 's success .
they 're really quite vain .
mother , especially .
she 's a great lady , my mother .
she 's wonderful !
i 'm often angry with her , but i adore her anyway .
as for my father , he 's a dreamer who can 't get over having become a successful businessman .
this is the living room .
- you know what he really wanted to be ?
- an opera singer .
- how did you know that ?
- because he told me , of course !
- we went to the lapin agile together .
- that 's just like him !
he took advantage of you to get away .
you 've already reached a level of trust with him ?
yes , but he doesn 't want me talking about it .
to my mother , perhaps .
as for me , you can talk about anything .
this is the dining room .
impressive .
come , i 'll take you to your room .
put your luggage on the bed and follow me .
and this ... is my lair .
you like jazz ?
are you familiar with the duke ?
no .
what about louis armstrong ?
no , not him either .
he 's giving a paris concert at the end of this month .
can you believe it ?
either way , i 'm going to meet him this year .
my parents have offered me a trip to new york for my holidays .
getting sick does have its advantage : your parents will grant your every wish .
can you imagine ?
i 'm going to spend new year 's eve at the cotton club ...
but i have a friend who 's living in new york !
his name is david zober .
i have no news of him .
well then , give me his address .
i will find this little buddy of yours .
are you familiar with benzoin ?
no .
take a seat .
you 'll get to know it .
- it 's an intoxicating oil .
- for cooking ?
of course not !
i 'm talking about the mind , not the body .
do you like this piece ?
yeah , really cool .
indubitably !
duke ellington !
isn 't this dangerous for someone with tuberculosis .
that , my dear , is the least of my worries .
besides , i 'm cured .
you scared ?
no !
- you 've never smoked before ?
- yes , quite often .
some " ich lif " .
my god , what an accent !
high life ! " vie elevee . "
high life .
you will experience the elevation of souls , the communion of spirits .
you see , me ... i would come across as a type of lafcadio .
who 's that ?
- the vatican cellars .
andre gide .
you know him ? - no .
the perfect crime .
when you think of it , the sanatorium had its merits .
i learned the two things a man must lose in his life .
his virginity and his illusions .
here .
" there , everything is order and beauty ,
" luxury , serenity and voluptuousness . "
what is voluptuousness ?
that is about to manifest .
don 't move , i 'll be right back .
olivier .
i 'd like you to meet julienne , my mother 's god-daughter , resident of the demoiselles de la legion d 'honneur .
she holds my mother 's dearest fervor ... when it comes to my marriage .
- julienne , i 'd like to present ...
- i know him , marceau .
- you 're the one who 's mother died .
- yes , that 's me .
out of kindness my parents decided to adopt him .
would you like a benzoin ciggy ?
no , thank you .
my feet are killing me .
saint-denis is quite the walking distance .
olivier , make yourself useful .
julienne has sore feet .
remove her shoes .
come on , hurry up .
slowly , olivier !
unlace them gently .
give them a massage .
my feet are really sore .
don 't tickle me .
just give me a massage .
look .
have you ever seen a woman before ?
have you ever seen a woman 's breasts ?
oh , you little scoundrel !
you 're a pervert !
how dare you !
this is not your place .
now go to your room !
scram !
write me a poem about julienne 's breasts .
- ma 'am , where would you like this luggage ?
- carry them to my room .
marguerite , tell the chauffeur to bring in the apples last .
we 'll put them in the store room .
which is master olivier 's room , now
very well , madame .
good day , mother .
did you have a nice trip ? - excellent !
where were you ?
- at the restaurant , with olivier .
we weren 't going to die of starvation awaiting your return .
come now .
give me a hug instead of making vile remarks .
- how do you feel ?
- i feel great .
let me have a look at you .
you 're right , you do look well .
why did you bring olivier back a day sooner ?
you could have let me know .
i could have avoided the detour to the college .
listen , he 'd been couped up long enough , don 't you think ?
good day , olivier .
good day , aunt .
i suppose marceau has already given you the grand tour ?
he has , yes .
very well . we 'll now go to your room .
since you are here , i will give you ...
- the house rules !
- that 's mean !
i hope you 'll be comfortable here .
this is where we keep the apples that we bring back ... every year from our estate in montrichard .
fortunately for you , the harvest was not abundant this year .
i hope you like apple sauce and apple pie .
here we eat it all the time .
- these are your belongings ?
- yes , aunt .
but they reek !
well , we 'll need to get rid of them .
including the clothes you are wearing .
i will let you have marceau 's old things . you can tell mother is from auvergne :
to her , a spade is a spade .
my dear child , you used to be more witty .
- these books are yours ?
- yes , aunt .
marie bashkirtseff ?
how unexpected !
schopenhauer ?
you mean you 're reading this at your age ?
- no , aunt .
- it so happens he has ... a certain culture .
i 've read one of his poems . it 's quite good .
anyway , what he needs most is a good bath .
i will ask marguerite to wash him in the laundry room . that 's right .
we wouldn 't want him staining the bathtub .
come on , marguerite , scrub harder . he 's got to shine like a new penny .
your cousin is a cute little angel .
- more so than moi , marguerite ?
- that 's not the same thing .
you 're a man , now .
alright , olivier .
come out and dry yourself .
hop , hop !
voila !
i say , aren 't we a wee bit scrawny , my little urchin ?
alright .
i 'm going to burn your clothes like madame said .
show me , olivier .
now , turn around .
it 's funny seeing you wear my old trappings .
" trappings " ?
ah , what an astute word .
do i detect montmartre 's influence ?
marceau , your father and i decided ... to prepare a little surprise for your homecoming .
julienne will join us for dinner this evening .
she will be happy to see you .
she spoke so often of you .
your father is picking her up at the print shop after work .
- are you pleased ?
- yes , mother .
i burn !
oh how i languish for julienne !
i love her , not as in the underworld , the ravager of a thousand men , but faithful , proud and a little diffident !
the divine ...
- good evening .
- good evening , monsieur .
godmother !
good evening , godmother .
my dear , how happy i am to see you .
and i 'm not the only one .
marceau is thrilled that you could join us for his homecoming .
it 's been such a long time since you 've last seen each other .
that 's true !
i even wondered if i would recognize you !
can you imagine ?
it 's now been over a year .
seems to me like it was yesterday .
and your father , do you recognize him ?
a your age you only change every 10 years .
at my age ?
am i that old ?
anyway , you have a much better disposition than when you left .
good to see you .
good .
let us have dinner so that julienne doesn 't get home too late .
i must get you to test drive my new delage .
julienne .
where 's olivier 's setting ?
in the kitchen .
he 's eating with the maids , of course .
why then did you tell him he was a member of the family ?
they cured his illness , but apparently not his character .
thank you .
marceau , return immediately to the dining room .
your stew is truly marvelous , blanche .
thank you , m. marceau .
for the last time , return to the dining room .
delicious , don 't you think ?
blanche , see to it that m. olivier joins us in the dining room .
- yes , madame .
- dear aunt , there 's is no need .
oh please , don 't give me that !
come on , let 's go .
look , olivier .
like this .
sorry , aunt .
it 's not your fault , olivier .
take note however that we don 't say : " sorry , " but " please excuse me . "
in conclusion , olivier , we are too good for you .
well my friend , say something .
yes .
be nice to your mother , marceau .
what is that dress you 're wearing ?
rochas ? poiret ?
no , schiaparelli .
what else you 'd like to know ?
i do like it .
- however ... - yes ?
your necklace doesn 't suit it .
a little flashy , don 't you think ?
we can discuss it further after our meal , if you like .
excellent idea , mother .
besides , after our little cafe , you and julienne could play us a duet ?
with pleasure , god-mother .
with pleasure , mother .
with pleasure , aunt .
olivier !
if you want us to keep you , you must change your attitude .
go to your room immediately .
- but , aunt ...
- immediately !
very well , aunt .
you 're worse than hitler .
marceau , illness doesn 't excuse everything .
i need no excuses , mother . and i 'm not longer ill .
marceau ...
marceau !
marceau , wake up !
wake up !
please , wake up !
i 'm okay . don 't move .
you had a spell .
i 'll get your mother .
no , olivier .
you didn 't see a thing .
but it might be serious .
you must see a doctor .
listen , olivier .
all the tests indicate i am cured .
makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fatigue .
marceau !
olivier , if you are a brother to me , swear you 'll never speak about this to anyone .
okay ?
come on , swear it .
i swear , marceau .
thanks , olivier .
... we are pleased to have him join a jam session , a big round of applause for mister ...
louis armstrong !
i just cut my lip .
don 't mention anything to my divine .
you swear ?
dear students , some of you might wonder why ... you would need to learn latin .
the pope , monsieur . no .
now pick a word at random . - light . - perfect example of latin roots .
light comes from the word lux , the light .
something that is lux-urious is something that is brilliant .
your turn to choose a word , chateauneuf .
poetry .
poetry comes from the latin word poesis , which in turn comes from the greek poiesis , meaning creation .
delepine , which word would you like to know the root of ?
football .
now here 's an example of a barbaric term we adopted , let alone its simple translation in our language .
" football , " in our language should mean :
ball at the foot , from the latin pedibus , meaning foot and ... excuse me ...
medical examination visit .
- i said in silence . - visit . from the word vis .
to see . and medical , from medicus , the doctor .
chateauneuf ? yes , that 's me .
- this is a surprise , olivier ! - good day , mr. lehman .
i mean , doctor .
- i was about to ask you the same thing .
so did i. the number of patients i had in my care was dwindling ;
good , now open wide .
i hate myself for what happened to your mother .
perhaps i didn 't do enough for her .
- you didn 't like me very much , did you ?
- well ...
believe me , i didn 't want to take your father 's place , olivier .
i just wanted to help your mother . in any event , she didn 't like you .
i think she did a bit . now , sit straight .
for you it 's very sad . she died so young .
i see your aunt is taking good care of you .
everything is fine .
you 're in perfect health . that 's it . you can get dressed , now .
thank you , doctor .
tell me doctor ?
- i would like to ask you ...
- yes ?
when people get ... when they come down with tuberculosis , can they get sick again , even after being cured ?
of course .
the terrible thing about this illness , a real cure still hasn 't been found .
if we cough up blood , it means we 're still sick ?
yes , and it 's really serious .
it 's typical , as are repeated coughs , and sometimes even loss of consciousness .
- is it contagious ?
- oh yes , extremely contagious ! but why are you asking me this ? well ...
i want to write a poem on tuberculosis .
on tuberculosis ? yes , why not ?
it 's true , lamartine ...
la dame aux camelias . thank you , doctor .
you 'll make yourself sick reading so much !
are those shoes ready yet , marguerite ?
yes , all done , madame .
good evening , olivier .
reading is a healthy habit , olivier , but not at the table .
what are you reading ?
still reading without family !
but i gave you that one over a month ago .
i love reading it over again .
granted . but there are other books more essential .
you look lovely , dear aunt .
well , aren 't you the gallant one !
this evening gown is for the french club .
henri is taking me . you should say to the " comedie
- francaise , " mother .
how could he possibly understand , he 's unversed .
i know it 's saturday , but getting up at sunset is a bit exaggerated , don 't you think ?
mother , i 'm preparing myself for the time difference .
it is now 11 o 'clock in new york . don 't plan too far ahead , marceau .
your trip is not official yet . don 't forget .
come , my little outcast , i need to speak with you .
thank you , marguerite . you won 't believe what 's happening to me .
i 'm in love ! i met a woman yesterday at a party gathering .
- what party ?
- the communist party !
you know , the reds . she 's simply amazing .
a mix between louise brooks and rosa luxemburg .
she 's a surrealist like me .
a dream come true .
there 's just one problem : she 's 15 years older .
i want to read you a poem i wrote her .
" crimson heart , pierced by faith ,
" may he who has never loved you never reach your depth . "
not bad for a start , don 't you think ? i 'm brilliant .
go ahead , tell me .
" marceau , you 're brilliant . "
- marceau , you 're brilliant .
- oh no , it 's pathetic .
you can 't really understand poetry . you 're stuck on victor hugo or leconte de lisle .
you know nothing about women .
you 've never been in love .
i know nothing about women ?
her name is mado .
and she 's a taxi-girl . - besides , we 're engaged .
- come on .
don 't make up stories just to try to impress me .
you 'll see if i 'm telling the truth . you 'll see . come .
here .
rinse your eyes on this .
she gave it me as a memento .
to someone else , you mean !
you probably stole it from your mother 's boutique .
nice piece , though .
and this is her calling card .
- she gave it to me personally .
you surprise me .
- are you still seeing this mado ?
- of course not .
not since my arrival here . don 't look so sad .
we 'll fix that .
- very pretty ! look . i just started a new novel .
- can you read it to me ?
- yes , of course .
" i was born , like everyone , from a mother and a father .
" and yet , i am not like everyone .
" one question haunts me :
" did my father and mother love each other ?
" were i not conceived in a state of love , i would rather die . "
- you asked me to . you shouldn 't !
you 're violating my intimacy .
you 're a little pervert ! you shouldn 't have ... you don 't understand !
it 's not because you 're older ...
you wouldn 't strike a sick person , would you ?
that 's just it , you 're really sick .
- dr lehman says you 're having a relapse . - what ? who 's this dr. lehman ?
you mentioned me ?
it 's the college physician .
i asked him about tuberculosis .
i know what happened to you the other day .
you were losing consciousness .
if you 're spitting blood , it 's serious and contagious .
you should inform your parents .
i see where you 're going with this .
you want to stop me from leaving , send me back to the sanatorium and take my place , here .
- you 're crazy , marceau . - hypocrite !
you think i didn 't catch your little act with mother ?
" you look lovely , dear aunt . "
- ass-licker .
- i 'm doing it for you !
don 't forget you promised me your silence .
you 're like a brother to me .
i owe you one .
forgive me , mother .
i rather stop here .
i thought you had finally shed the awkward age , but you still revel in it .
spare me your cliches .
my dear , your son is extremely rude right now .
marceau , please !
if you want to go on your trip , you better clean up your act .
you are wanted on the telephone .
hello ! oh yes .
yes . i know who this is .
listen , it 's a delicate issue for me .
good .
i will be there in 15 minutes , under the arches .
let me see olivier .
- he 's not your child . - i know that . but i could be just like a father to him .
he chose not to go with you .
but he 's no longer in his favorite neighbourhood .
please stop right there , monsieur privat . my wife would never allow it .
on what grounds ?
you didn 't take him in out of love .
put yourself in her place .
you came to our home to kill your brother and virginie .
and now you would want to take their son ?
i didn 't kill anyone .
and i spent time behind bars .
thirteen years of my life .
i need this child to give meaning to my life .
but does he need you ?
even if we handed him over to you , think of what people would say .
believe me , i can understand your pain .
but think about the day olivier will learn everything about your past .
i 'm certain he will be able to forgive me .
but once you tell him the whole truth , you 'll be shattering the image he has of his parents .
do you think you have the right to do that ?
there 's a ladder in the courtyard .
you climb up , and down the other side using the street lamp .
a 5 year-old could do it . there you 'll see a bike .
you get on it , and within 10 minutes you wind up at the bouchon de champagne .
here .
here 's some money to have a good time .
i 'll take your place , in case the supervisor can 't sleep .
i don 't think i can pull it off .
i 'm too scared .
i 've done it dozens of times without ever getting caught .
" audaces fortuna juvat , " olivier .
it 's time to see if your life will be that of a sheep , or if you will write it yourself , every day .
don 't you want to see mado again ?
good evening , mam 'zelle mado good evening , m 'sieur hubert .
that wasn 't very smart .
are you angry with me ?
not at all !
i 'm actually moved .
you can 't follow me inside , though .
now there , don 't be sad .
wait , i have an idea .
jules ?
ask g.g. to come out with his accordion .
- i have a little commission for him .
give him 10 francs , he 'll be happy .
- i 'll give him 20 ! - no , that 's too much . you asked for me , mado ?
yes , g.g. here 's a young client for you .
what shall i play for you ?
olivier , what would you like ? a tango !
a tango for my little fiance .
the most beautiful tango in the world ?
- yes , that 's fine .
- i 'm not a very good dancer .
i was forced , and this is only a temporary measure of course , to confiscate this elegant pen which arrived in the mail . - it was intended for olivier ?
- indeed , madame .
in this college , we discourage possession of valuable objects ... which would risk to excite the greed of certain pupils ... towards their more fortunate peers .
i thought it might be you .
i 'm not in the habit of spoiling children with gifts of this value .
- may i see olivier ? - by all means . i 've already sent for him .
he 's waiting in the vestibule .
come in , olivier .
i leave you together .
good day , aunt . who sent you this pen ?
i ...
i don 't know , aunt .
don 't lie to me , olivier .
it could only have come from him .
have the courage to tell me the truth .
yes .
it is a gift from monsieur privat .
i will send it back . you must never accept anything from this man .
but why not , aunt ?
you 're too young to know about these things .
but i need to know !
since you put it like that , i 'll tell you .
one day , in december of 1917 , the war was still raging ,
privat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun .
- he wanted to kill them , olivier .
i don 't believe you . why was my mother intent on living with him ?
i 'm still trying to figure that out . your mother and i never saw eye to eye on many things .
why didn 't you tell me sooner ?
i didn 't want you to get upset .
i hope we never have to discuss this matter ever again .
anyway , sooner or later , you would have found out .
enter .
of course you will .
because you are pure .
wild child .
street child .
- please stop gloating at my expense ! - you see , she dropped me . who did ?
this militant girl who wrote these pathetic lines .
i 'm down to listening to this music for rejected lovers .
all around me ,
" everything is order and beauty . "
and yet , my pain is real . why ?
marceau ...
you knew about ... about my parents and privat ?
what are you talking about ?
well ...
the time privat ... the time he came here .
your mother told me the story . the divine finally coughed it up ?
yes .
privat fired shots at them .
in fact , it happened right here .
in this very room where your parents stayed . i was only 2 at the time .
but look .
look at the mirror .
impacts left by the bullets .
see where love can lead ?
a few centimeters to the side ... and you 'd never have been born , my little outcast .
but rest assured ,
why didn 't you tell me ?
because this story is boring as hell , my friend .
two grown men love the same woman . an ordinary drama based on jealousy .
you 're mama was nothing more than a small-time goddess , as my mother put it .
come on , cheer up .
i don 't want to see you suffer , my little angel . please spare me your expressions of grandeur !
we are both injured and abandoned souls .
like two starlings fallen from the nest .
yes ?
m. marceau , a girl is asking for you .
- a girl ? - mlle charlotte dalet . charlotte ?
have her come in , quick !
a woman leaves me , i find another . - who is she ?
- the nurse from the sanatorium . - the one who ...
- who taught me how to love . - you know what you have to do ?
- change wards .
- good day , marceau .
- charlotte ! what a joy to see you again !
i 'll give you some privacy .
stop it , marceau .
so , if i can 't kiss you , what brings you to paris ?
i shouldn 't be telling you this , but i don 't want to deceive you .
the director will be sending a letter to your parents .
a letter ?
whatever for ? you 're having a serious relapse , marceau .
the lab you visit for your routine check-ups ... has sent us the results of your samples .
the samples indicate you are once again infected .
but you said i had been cured .
the pneumothorax was extremely effective .
but when it comes to tuberculosis , you can never be sure . i must go back to the sanatorium ?
i 'm afraid so .
upon your release , you registered less than 1000 bk .
but today , you must be well over 100.000 ! it 's a serious relapse .
you must start a new treatment .
worst of all , you could have infected your entire family .
i understand why you wouldn 't let me kiss you .
how convenient for you .
you can work on my case .
i 'll be once again your little patient . i 'll be there with you .
every hour , every second ! - you have no right to say that !
even if the truth is painful to hear . so there , goodbye !
are we eavesdropping , now ?
i 'm expecting a love letter .
- you 're at that age !
- see you .
well , well . a letter for olivier .
it 's from america .
nothing for me .
i am gloom , the grieving inconsolable widower .
" the prince of aquitaine at the forsaken tower ! "
marceau the early bird .
- i hope you 're not ill , at least .
of course not , mother .
i feel great !
what 's with him this morning ?
he must be in love , madame .
good for him .
but not a word about this to julienne .
get up , lazy- bones !
even though we 're on vacation , we don 't get up any later .
america ?
thank you , marguerite .
it 's from david .
he must have quite a few stories to share !
there are tons of postcards !
- skyscrapers ! - and even photos .
show me .
the mail has arrived ?
obviously , because you received your letter .
- but , marceau ?
- monsieur marceau ?
you 're not going to read your letter ?
- did he get mail this morning ?
- no .
he was so disappointed his new sweetheart hadn 't written to him .
what are you doing ?
i 'm depositing the 2nd mail batch , as i always do at noon .
there is a 2nd mail run ?
of course . this is paris !
since you 're going back to college i advise you to take a balzac .
it will take you all week to read " les illusions perdues . "
or even " la cousine bette . "
good morning , father .
i just received a letter that concerns you . really ?
you know what it might be about ? no , i can 't think of anything . you know , this american friend i wrote to ... ?
well , he agreed .
he would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish .
i can now confirm your travel arrangements .
you will embark on the de grace , on the morning of december 16 .
- happy ? - you bet !
your mother and i are sad you won 't spend christmas with us .
but more important , we want you to be happy . you 'll see , mr. dewilde will make good company .
what does he do for a living ? he owns a few movie theaters in new york .
they call them nickelodeons .
ah yes , the penny cinema .
here 's one ... a letter from the sanatorium .
i have a hunch i know what it 's about .
it 's what i thought .
well they 've got some nerve !
they 're claiming reimbursement for a window pane i broke by accident .
medical services are already expensive . they should cover that .
i 'll call the director immediately .
hello , mademoiselle ?
get me number 16 at st - pierre - les
- bains , haute - loire .
marceau desrousseau speaking .
i 'd like to speak to the director , please . thank you .
i beg you , marceau , be diplomatic .
take the receiver .
and learn from the master .
hello ? mister director ?
yes :
no , not very well .
my parents just received a letter from your accounting department .
it claims reimbursement of a window pane i accidentally broke .
it was a mistake ?
i 'm happy to hear it .
i will let you take care of it .
thank you , mister director .
give my best to madame .
goodbye . you had gall .
yes , you went straight to the point !
from now on , i will have you deal directly with my creditors .
with pleasure , father .
monsieur is served .
you 're crazy , marceau .
voila .
tell me what you think .
" concerning the state of health of our son .
" in a sanatorium close to paris .
" as soon as we can , we will inform you of the ...
" address of this establishment ,
" so that you may share with them our son 's medical records .
" yours truly ... " etc .
pretty good , right ? you 're out of your mind , marceau .
you can 't do that .
charlotte said it would be suicide .
charlotte says that to keep me in the sanatorium . as you can see , i 'm in good health .
that 's not true , marceau . even yesterday i could hear you coughing .
excuse me .
i must mail this at once .
stand up !
stand up ! companions in misery .
- what 's going on , olivier ?
- i want you to stay out of this . - you 'll be able to go back ...
- once you 're back to health .
- nothing could be more uncertain .
so i would prefer being overseas .
i would rather die at the cotton club instead of the asylum .
you won 't say a word about it to my parents .
you promised .
yes , but i didn 't know just how serious this is .
not to say the number of people you can contaminate .
i will tell them everything . if you do , i 'll tell them of your outing to mado .
they 'll send you to your grandpa 's to become a blacksmith 's apprentice .
you 're such a bastard .
i don 't give a damn ! - i don 't want you to die , you understand ?
- i think you just want me to stay here .
you wouldn 't have the balls .
just wait and see .
- who is it ? - it 's me , olivier .
come in .
something really serious .
well , what is it ?
it 's , hm ...
i 'm sorry i didn 't make it to the circus on my birthday .
that 's it ?
you scared me . it was quickly forgotten , olivier .
i forgive you , of course .
you must get up early tomorrow . the holidays are over .
yes , aunt .
such a strange boy .
ah ! if he had marceau 's education !
if marceau had his state of health !
- so that 's it . you 're going to play me like a violin , now ?
really , you 're not sparing me anything .
you think i 'm going to roll over like a dog ? " don 't go , i 'll spill the beans "
you 're totally wrong .
here , you forgot you beret .
you 'll be back within the hour .
you read too much " without family . "
you should reflect on the difference between literature and reality .
- farewell , marceau .
wake up , olivier . it 's time !
it 's 7 o 'clock .
but ...
olivier ?
- you haven 't seen him ? - no .
not this morning . yes .
he told me he had to leave to review his latin .
i helped him till past midnight .
he was probably intent on leaving without waking me .
i came to tell you he 's ill .
a simple phone call would have sufficed .
i have fond memories of this place .
i didn 't want to miss the opportunity .
as for your cousin , i hope it 's nothing serious .
i was their family physician in montmartre .
yes of course , montmartre .
hey ! guys !
they should count their forts .
we should have some enemies .
we were once at peace , but everybody got confused .
hey ! wait for me .
you 're not fighting anymore with the riffraff of bachelet st. ?
that 's ancient history !
let 's go , i 'm starved . see you ! see you capdeverre .
i 'm hungry too .
see you later ! see you , loulou .
don 't you look dapper in those god awful pants !
so long .
i need some grub too .
so long , riri .
bougras !
m 'sieur bougras !
- where to ? - i have no idea .
if you see him again , tell him ... he ran a pigsty in here .
it reeked as hell !
no problem , young man .
they 're in a rush and i 'm under the gun .
- jean is fine ?
- not so bad . - did he find work ?
- yes .
yes . and how is the baby ?
- leg of lamb " soissons . "
- coming up . - you were saying ?
- you 're baby , how 's he doing ? an apple pudding with leg of lamb " soissons . "
bon appetit .
the baby ?
he 's adorable .
he 's with mrs. hacque .
she 's babysitting . go see him !
will do , elodie .
so long , elodie .
glazier !
he 's a bit like your cousin .
isn 't he the cutest ?
i often take care of him .
poor elodie never stops .
and with jean without a steady job , and he likes to drink a bit .
in the end , you did well to leave .
- but i was forced to leave !
- well , you know what i mean .
you were such a hooligan !
your aunt and uncle ... do they treat you well ?
yes , madame hacque .
in retrospect , your mother 's death ...
i wouldn 't say it was a lucky break , far from it , mothers are irreplaceable .
but for your future ...
often we say : a blessing in disguise .
ah , here comes elodie .
it 's me , my little treasure !
my love , it 's your mama .
i came to tell you i won 't be off work until 2 : 30pm .
he 's a real cakewalk your little cherub .
you gave me a hell of a scare my little angel .
that 's too easy .
you 're a bastard , marceau .
you think you can just die off like that ?
do whatever you like with your life ?
didn 't you think about the others ?
your parents ? julienne ?
me ?
what will become of me if you ... if you die ? now , now .
don 't worry so much .
that 's enough .
you want me to say you 're right .
is that it ? i have given it some thought .
i decided i 'll talk to my parents .
you 're lying . hang on , my doubting thomas .
you want my passport ?
they 're yours .
without them , i can 't go . it 's a trick .
you 'll only take them back !
what else do you need , then ?
- give it to me .
- it 's a trick !
i 'll show you a trick .
so , little outcast ?
happy now ?
dear olivier ,
the landscape hasn 't changed much in the last 6 months .
boredom here has reached a new philosophical dimension .
luckily , the pain from the pneumothorax keeps me awake .
i 'm so jaded that seeing your face again would bring back my spirits .
and so , if you can , please come .
the sanatorium is near saugues . find a way to get sent away to live with your grandpa .
i wait for you , my olive , without fail . - marceau
this morning , therefore , the supervisor found olivier 's scarf in the yard .
yes , and what of it ?
it was found at the bottom of the gardener 's ladder ... which was leaning against the school wall , ostensibly in order to jump over to the other side .
furthermore , in doing olivier 's bed , the chambermaid found this .
i judged it would be best to notify you before talking to olivier .
you don 't think that olivier ... mister director , i know him . i can 't imagine him doing such a thing .
and yet , the evidence is obvious . i 'd say a little too obvious .
do you believe , mister director , that a student jumping the wall would leave the ladder behind ?
moreover his scarf bearing his name ?
or keeping such compromising evidence in the dormitory ?
i would rather think he was the target of a prank .
a very bad schoolboy prank . i think my husband is correct in his assessment , mister director .
our nephew knows what fate would await him should he do such a thing .
we would send him off to his grandparents , in auvergne .
you 're probably right .
i should have known better . if one of our students was bent on tarnishing the image of your nephew , rest assured he will be punished accordingly .
i will deal with this matter immediately .
what happened in 1685 ?
delepine ! the assassination of henri iv by ravaillac , monsieur .
he would have been mighty , this ravaillac , to assassinate a king who had been dead for 75 years !
yes , susse !
1685 , revocation of the edict of nantes by louis xiv , sir .
well done . now , what happened in ...
be seated , children .
i 'm here to discuss a serious matter .
it would appear that one of you ... wanted to get chateauneuf accused of jumping the wall .
his scarf was left behind in the yard as evidence ... and other objects i won 't mention at this time , were planted in his personal belongings in the dormitory .
perhaps it was only meant as a stupid prank . but i would summon the guilty party to come forth in this instant , otherwise i will have to take measures against the entire class .
" a fault confessed is half redressed . " gentlemen !
i 'm waiting .
chateauneuf , you would like to speak ?
nobody played a trick on me , sir .
i did jump the wall last night .
i don 't want the entire class punished on my account .
- and where did you go ? - to see a friend .
the girlies !
- what do you mean : " the girlies " ?
- the streetwalkers , sir .
olivier !
shame on you ! you 're a disgrace .
i don 't want you living with us anymore .
at least you don 't look like a hooligan !
come on , let 's go .
ho , victor !
can 't this wait ?
- she 's all yours , antonin . - you 're holding us up .
adios !
give it to me .
you will call me " tonton . "
and that girl ... not a word about her to granny .
all right , tonton .
you 'll see . there isn 't much here to lift grannie 's spirits .
she 's not thrilled with your arrival .
with grandpa , it 's different .
he just loves telling stories .
so he 's happy that you 're coming .
besides , since injuring his leg , he 's been bored stiff .
listen , i must teach you a phrase in " patois , " and you will repeat it to him .
oh , gustou , beni fara monegue . say it .
oh , gustou , beni fara monegue .
we don 't have much time for you to learn it .
we 're here . there 's the " oustaou . "
- go on , say the phrase .
- oh , gustou , beni fara monegue .
" allo pitchou " !
let me look at you .
you have your father 's eyes . come on in !
i prepared a snack for you .
you must be hungry after your trip .
here were are .
over here , it 's not like at victoria 's .
it will be a lot different than my daughter 's apartment .
there . you 'll see .
we can be quite comfortable here , too . sit over here .
we 'll get you something to eat . here .
this will be your pocket knife .
you must give a coin in return .
it 's the custom .
- will this do , tonton ?
it 's not for the money .
it 's to preserve friendship .
you 're grandma isn 't here .
she 's picking mushrooms .
and a bit of water , of course !
well , then ?
- how is it , good ?
- victor , where are you ?
see that door , it 's your room .
you can put your things .
will you show him how to forge ?
yes , you can watch me smith iron .
and if you 're not too tired , you can give me a hand .
see you later , tonton .
i say , you look a bit pale to me .
don 't worry , here you 'll soon get back your color .
here comes grannie .
victor didn 't warn you ? she 's a bit of a grouch .
she doesn 't like kissing very much .
give grandma a hug , olivier .
careful ! dummy , you 'll make the mushrooms tip over .
- we 're in for a treat tonight !
- no . you 'll have to wait until sunday .
