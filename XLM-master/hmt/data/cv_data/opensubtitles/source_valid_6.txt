it 's too dangerous here .
i 'll try to go to paris on my own .
meet me there .
i love you .
the french government has fled to tours .
by god , france is collapsing !
we should declare independence .
send us garibaldi and algeria will take care of itself , just like italy .
you want us to fight 3 million arabs all by ourselves ?
- what are the other wires ?
- nothing important .
say , what do you think of ...
what 's wrong ?
" on the front , the incredible bravery " of the ' chasseurs d 'afrique , ' algerian soldiers and zouaves ,
" cost them dearly .
" the second ' turcos ' was bled dry .
" its officers were killed in action . "
shit .
the second " turcos ... " that 's aissa 's regiment !
friends ...
military rule is over .
algeria has been split into 3 departments governed by french law .
the departments will be run by a prefect and by members of parliament .
the governor-general must now be a civilian , under the ministry of the interior .
we 've won , my friends !
algeria is both civilian and french !
a french algeria !
- long live french algeria !
- wait . settle down . there 's more .
the 33,000 algerian jews are now automatically french .
- will we be allowed to vote ?
- of course .
- what about the arabs ?
- not for now . phew !
my heart stopped .
shut up !
thousands of " turcos " and zouaves died on the battlefield . they voted with their blood .
a minute of silence for our muslim brothers who died for france .
why did you keep that from me ?
i had made a promise .
how could you keep such a secret to yourself this long ?
" dear father , " you reading this letter means i was killed in action . "
" don 't cry .
" i 'll gladly give france the life you 've given me " that has nothing left in store for me .
" i will finally rest in peace " under the watchful eye of the 2 gods who ruled " over my life and death . "
" the almighty god of the arabs , who controls good and evil " and the merciful christian god " who can forgive every sin . "
" i 'm writing you to remind you of your promise . "
" jeanne ... " must never find out . "
" never . "
" farewell .
" your son , aissa . "
what happened ?
why did he reject me ?
hey arab !
stay where you are !
don 't move , arab !
- yes ?
- open up !
i didn 't know where else to go .
come in .
oh , it 's you .
where 's bahia ?
she went to oran with her father .
why didn 't you take her with you ?
i 'd have looked after her .
have you eaten ?
no .
i 'm not hungry .
i 'll go make your bed .
you can 't stay in algeria .
they 'll kill you .
you can spend the night here . tomorrow , i 'll put you on a boat to spain .
i paid half already .
give them the rest when you arrive .
this is a safe-conduct .
just in case .
and a pistol .
it could come in handy .
thank you .
- what a beautiful country .
- our country .
- what happened to us , odilon ?
- life .
do you remember menilmontant ?
uniting the east and the west ?
why did you forsake our ideals ?
they were utopian .
the arab kingdom is not utopian .
just the opposite . it 's realistic .
you 'll see it too one day .
why do you force your ideals on me ?
mine are as good as yours .
i want this land to become a part of france , of republican france . freedom , equality , fraternity .
freedom ? or the right for the strong to oppress the weak !
not necessarily .
republican education will turn these arabs into good french citizens .
it 'll take time , but i 'm optimistic .
they should become good algerian citizens , instead !
you 're bound to fail !
the future will decide .
- god will decide .
what happened to toussaint ?
i never saw him again .
i 'm told he went back to algeria .
how come ?
he followed his own path , alone , which doesn 't surprise me .
you never saw him again ?
wasn 't he a friend ?
you see , we never parted ways .
you know , we need utopians , dreamers .
the world couldn 't exist without them .
excuse me , i must go now .
it 's rather cold in here , wouldn 't you agree ?
it is .
after a while , the cold gets to you .
it 's just awful .

looks like somebody 's having a bad head day .
detective chance briggs , you old bucket of shrimps .
what 's my old partner doing here ?
the yoozh .
what 's with the water coming out of the face ?
he was my ex-boyfriend .
i loved his head . the victim had his head ripped clean off .
look familiar to you , maestro ?
looks an awful lot like that rash of murders 15 years ago .
those were all boyfriends of yours , too , right , cat ?
it 's almost enough to make a girl stop dating .
or only date guys you want to see dead .
can you find the person who did this ?
not on my own . i 'm gonna need some help from my old partner .
i haven 't been a cop for a long time .
it 's in your blood , your glands .
i could smell it in you on our first day working together .
_
detective briggs ?
i 'm your new partner , owen maestro .
ugh !
rookie move , maestro . never let your guard down like that .
but section 19 / a of the rule book says --
the rule book 's never been out on the streets .
sometimes , you got to bend the rules .
sucker punch !
sucker punch ! but that 's not what we learned at the academy .
the academy doesn 't know crap .
just ask the rule book . release .
so , what 's our assignment ?
the childrens hospital murders .
they just found a fourth victim decapitated like the others .
four decapitations , huh ?
these victims sound like the beatles of decapitations .
the fab four -- without heads .
i mean i 've heard of " help , " but this is ridiculous .
mop tops ? how about no tops ?
you know that song " come together " ?
well , this is like " come apart . "
you know .
" i want to hold my head . "
... " on , so it doesn 't get cut off . "
this band is not gonna have the talking heads for an opening act .
- let 's go .
which one of you is in charge ?
well , that couldn 't be me .
the only thing i 'm in charge of is this .
hey , uh , boss !
- these guys want to talk to you .
- okay . okay , i 'll talk to you later .
hi . i 'm brad lendricks .
i 'm the head paramedic .
what do you want ?
it 's about the recent killings at the hospital .
you mean the ones due to the serial killer or medical negligence ?
let 's save the snaps for " yo mtv snaps . "
word is the paramedics are the eyes and ears of the hospital .
brad can 't help you .
no , he 's always been mysteriously missing whenever a murder happened .
if you 'll excuse me , i have to go stand over there .
if you ask me , brad 's glad all those guys got offed .
see , he 's been in love with cat for years , but she refuses to go out with him .
and now he 's got a clear playing field .
a clearly stated motive .
still , we need some solid evidence .
all we have on the guy is what this bald asshole told us .
no offense -- i 'm sure you have some really great qualities , too .
i 'm just going off of first impressions .
you know , i 've always wanted to be a doctor .
ever since i graduated medical school .
so , did you ever become a doctor ?
yeah . i 've been a doctor for 15 years .
oh , yeah , right .
that is not good enough , okay ?
i want these tires to be white !
there 's more urine where this came from .
there 's that paramedic .
how do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago ?
chet mandvanteussen ?
just do it better next time .
we want to talk to you about the murder of cat 's most recent boyfriend .
you 've done pretty well for yourself , haven 't you , mandvanteussen ?
you 're head paramedic now , your own ambulance , your own assistant .
maybe . doesn 't mean i killed cat 's boyfriend .
it could have been anybody .
what about former secretary of state condoleezza rice ?
okay . not her .
one down .
about 6 billion to go .
we need the personnel records on everyone who 's worked here in the past 15 years .
i 'm sorry .
any files over 14 years old are converted into microfilm and then shipped to our storage facility in the deep south where they are then destroyed .
i wish i could be more helpful .
_
turn up anything ?
and lots of it .
just like we found at each of the other murder scenes .
yeah , and according to the lab , all the semen samples came from the same person , probably male .
i would say definitely male .
my guess is lendricks , but we can 't know without a sample of his semen .
detective ?
i 'm on it .
i like your haircut .
thank you .
got it .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
this is a cutting-edge device used to identify dna .
welcome to the future , my friend .
and now i 'll just call the lab .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
it 's the new motorola clamshell , briggs .
you never seen a cellphone ?
sure , but if i need to call someone , i 'll use a pay phone .
this is more than just a phone , partner .
look -- time and date .
good god .
i guess it is a time and date machine .
we got a match .
- chet , are you cleaning that gurney ?
- yes , sir ! hold it right there .
you 're under arrest for the murder of --
whoa ! i want to talk to a lawyer !
the only lawyer you 'll be talking to is one appointed to you by the court .
veteran move , maestro .
wrong seat .
could you get in the back , please ?
oh . there we go .
watch your head .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , girls .
zoe , thank you so much for your note .
that was so sweet .
lendricks .
last time we saw you , you were a man .
what ?
shut up !
i made a deal with the district attorney to be sent to the women 's prison --
better food , less athlete 's foot , and the sex is amazing .
what ? anything goes !
we think your old assistant chet may be copycatting you .
i didn 't do it in the first place .
wait . what ?
your semen was found at every crime scene .
semen , semen , semen , semen !
i used to masturbate in the closets at work .
is that a crime ?
in iraq , yes , and also here .
okay , all i ask is that when you find this guy , you clear my name .
except for the masturbating part .
i did do that , and i want that credit .
look at us , huh ?
working a case , just like the first day we met .
actually ... it 's time i told you about the real first day we met .
what 's happening ?
the year was 1992 .
during my junior year at oberlin , i took a part-time job at a veterinary hospital -- the night shift .
it was just me and the animals .
this is where he figures out who the murderer is .
as the months progressed , i had to figure out a way to pass the time ...
you stupid ape .
you missed a straight diagonal move .
... but i was bored , so , of course , i started dressing up this one baboon in human clothes .
just one more thing .
my name is chance briggs .
- very good .
- briggs . i own you .
own .
me owen .
sure .
you owen .
i 'm gonna call you owen .
owen ! that 's right .
- owen .
- you owen !
- me owen !
- you owen .
you were a monkey .
that explains so much .
like how i have no human relatives .
and how i always think of you as a god .
yep . monkeys are capable of many things .
too bad they aren 't better at solving crimes .
wait a minute .
i think i just figured it out .
i think i just solved both cases .
if you 're right , then i 'll take back what i said about monkeys not being good at solving crimes .
my partner needs to ask you some questions , chief .
if you don 't cooperate with us , ma 'am , we 're gonna have to take you down to the station for questioning .
don 't you get it , briggs ?
that 's not chief .
that 's not chief one bit .
that 's a baboon .
i won 10 large at the track , monkey .
be back tomorrow before post time .
- crap .
- wait a minute .
what 's this money doing at your desk ?
okay , you got me .
i dress up this baboon to fill in for me when i go to the track .
it 's an old chief surgeon 's trick .
i 've been doing it for 15 years .
your days of monkeying around are over .
yeah . it 's gonna be a real hard day 's night for you .
let it be .
a baboon is so strong , they could tear a man 's head clean off his body .
which is exactly what he 's been doing ... for 15 years .
isn 't that right , fella ?
and there 's your confession .
you 're in big trouble .
why ?
is replacing yourself at work with a monkey a crime ?
in iraq , yes .
but not here , so ...
actually , i guess you 're not in trouble .
great .
thanks , guys .
how did you figure it out ?
sherlock holmes once said ,
" when you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , is most likely a monkey . "
it takes a baboon to know a baboon .
sure does , partner . it sure does .
- owen , no .
it 's just a siren ! - aah ! - aah !
aah ! - really ?
! really ? !
- heel ! - aah ! aah !
- release ! release , buddy !
no , bad owen !

- i 'm sorry !
we got back late from the cottage .
um , we were supposed to study before rounds .
i know , but it was so hard to leave .
it was beautiful there .
except for the mosquitoes .
they were huge !
you should have seen the size of them .
they were like vampire bats .
and for whatever reason , they were only biting me .
you should see my back .
i 'm covered in bites .
i can 't stop scratching .
except some of them , i can 't really reach ' cause they 're in the middle of my back .
would you mind rubbing this bite stuff on me ?
oh !
who are you ? !
- i 'm a doctor .
- so am i !
good !
so why are we yelling ? !
i ...
ooh !
i want to be with her .
i 'm ...
i 'm sorry , that 's - that 's not possible .
she 's gone .
i know .
[ inhales sharply but i ...
i should be with her .
it 's ... it 's not fair that she 's alone .
right .
well , i 'm ...
i 'm gonna make sure you have a chance to say a proper goodbye , all right ?
um ...
i just need you to lift up your arm for me .
kurt , did you know that illyana had agreed to be an organ donor ?
yeah , of course .
we signed our cards together .
okay , well , of course , we 're gonna need a final consent if there are any family members .
there aren 't .
i 'm her only family .
well , illyana is gonna be able to help more people today than she ever could have imagined .
what do you mean ?
um ...
illyana is a match for a patient waiting for a kidney transplant .
that patient 's fiance wanted to donate his , but they weren 't a match .
but illyana is ?
yeah , it 's ... it 's actually ...
it 's even better than that .
see , the , um ...
the patient 's fiance has agreed to ... to give his kidney to someone else , and that patient 's donor partner has also consented .
we call all of this a domino transplant .
basically ...
four people are gonna have a second shot at life today , and three people are willing to put their lives on the line ... all because of illyana .
seriously , are you ...
are you hearing this ?
uh ...
it 's nothing .
um ...
okay , i 'm ...
so why don 't you get some rest , okay ?

that 's awful , alex .

okay .
who 's o-neg with a 6 antigen match .
shahir , she 's the perfect donor for terry brown .
you 're talking about the domino transplant ?
when 's the last time you saved four lives in a single day ?
we 'll need to organize our surgeries so the wait time for each recipient is as soon as possible .
they 'll need to be off of dialysis and ready to go as soon as their organs arrive .
we 'll also need a team to confirm that the recipients are prepped and in the o.r. by the time their kidneys arrive .
this is keith .
he 's our last recipient .
but he 's in severe renal failure and can 't travel to hope zion , so we will coordinate with st. donald 's to deliver his kidney .
this is all hands on deck .
i 'm gonna bring in the junior residents .
williams and mirani will keep things moving .
we 'll get sekara to be our gopher for the day .
the most important thing to remember is , we 've got one shot at this .
seven surgeries .
four harvest and three transplants in the next few hours before the final kidney goes to st. donald 's children 's hospital .
if something goes wrong with one ...
and the dominoes stop falling , so no screw-ups .
everyone , dr. jeremy bishop , our newest gen-surg on staff .
- i 'm alex .
- reid .
yeah .
you need no introduction .
charlie 's told me a lot about you .
thank you for diving in .
some of our junior residents .
check the board , make sure you know where ...
how are the bug bites ?
we 'll be the first in the city to lead a multi-hospital domino transplant .
doogie .
how 's it going ?
okay , maggie , take dev and start the first harvest .
cassie and asha , i 'll need you to coordinate .
i 'll be handling all of the transplants .

you know , we 're cancer patients , not historians .
josh lewis , professor of 18th-century poetry .
or , well , i was until ...
has the , uh , has the nurse been in yet ?
no .
it 's hurry up and wait .
well , they have to test our blood first , so ...
yeah , make sure it 's okay to poison it .
yeah , the irony 's not lost on me .
but , then , nothing about this place makes any sense .
i mean ...
i mean , i know ...
let 's get all the sick people , we 'll put them in one place , and then have them treated by some semi-socialized beaker head with a god complex .
sorry . didn 't catch your name .

you 're good to go .
let 's get you started on the docetaxel .
yum , yum .
i 'm a doctor , too .
doctor of old poems .
you writing a book ?
trying to .
thought i might have at least one great novel in me .
although , now it turns out it might have to be a novella .
or it might just be , you know , a professional hazard .
teaching all that great literature , making me think i can do it , too .
speaking of professional hazards ...
doctor becomes a patient , huh ?
mm .
all done .
you 're next up , josh .
you guys need anything , i 'm your gal today .
thank you , dawson .
you know , it must be hard , knowing all the facts , to still believe you can actually beat this .
i 'm putting both of you under at the same time .
no food , no drinks , so finish up your beers , boys .
you ready to get off dialysis ?
hell yeah , he 's ready .
we got a wedding to plan .
so , we got transport on standby to take your kidney to st. donald 's .
dr. reid will be with you shortly .
you ready , erin ?
my twins turn 7 next week .
i 've been on dialysis since they were 4 years old .
so yeah .
i 'm ready .
it 's been a long road .
thank you .
we 're just waiting for your donor .
larry 's not big on cellphones .
all he 's got is this old flip , and the battery 's always dead .
well , time is of the essence , emma .
he can 't just disappear like this .
he 'll be here , honey .
larry doesn 't have time for a lot of people , but his big sister 's one of them .
nobody can help an old guy with a chair , huh ?
- larry !
- larry .
must 've passed a dozen orderlies schlepping this damn thing .
you 'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before liz taylor here .
got your chair .
larry ...
they found a donor .
what ?
i 'm getting my kidney .
the right donor came in to trigger the domino chain .
it is our lucky break .
well , i ...
i wasn 't expecting this today .
well , yes , i know .
this is all coming very fast .
but we need to move now .
we 'll get you into surgery shortly .
but , uh ...
i was just reading this thing online .
a guy gave his kidney , and ... and , um ...
he developed an unexplainable appetite for pumpkin pie .
wouldn 't eat anything else ...
just pumpkin pie , pumpkin pie , day after day .
i hate pumpkin pie .
are you seriously talking about pie right now ?
i ...
i just need time to process this , emma .
dr. reid , maggie sent me down .
something wrong , dr. reid ?
it 's fine .
just try to relax .
excuse me .
what 's going on ?
it 's the cadaveric donor .
we lost the right kidney .
how bad is it , maggie ?
right kidney 's lost blood supply .
it 's a goner .
left one is hypoplastic .
so , we are looking at a small kidney with a crazy arterial network .
might be too many to anastomose .
well , terry 's prepped .
they haven 't opened him up yet .
what do you want to do ?
i promised four patients they were getting off dialysis today .
that is still the plan .
okay , we will cut a piece of her aorta , use it to make an arterial cuff around the renal arteries , and then we 'll have one in anastomosis instead of three .
okay .
go get ready for the next harvest , please .
mm-hmm .
somebody page dr. bishop .
all right , ureter is free .
just the artery cuff to go .
so , the weather 's great in l.a. why 'd you come back ?
i tried an emergency spinal corpectomy on a 15-year-old car crash victim .
did they die ?
no .
no , i saved her life .
and i still got sued anyway .
wow .
that is rough .
yeah .
they had more lawyers on staff than doctors .
suction .
i wasn 't getting any better ...
just safer .
from everything i 've heard about you , caution isn 't really your thing .
the way you 're working those scissors , i 'd say it 's not yours , either .
okay .
here we go .
got it .
start perfusion and get it ready for transplant .
kristine .
oh , hey .
have you , um , seen a , uh ...
uh , yeah .
i 've seen her .
i 've been hearing her all day , too .
yeah .
i 've been trying to talk to her .
no , she doesn 't want to talk .
i don 't think she wants any help at all .
okay , well , what does she want ?
uh , well , what do you know about her ?
uh ...
she 's a trapeze artist .
her and her partner took a bad fall .
he managed to pull through , but she 's having her ... harvested as we speak .
ohhh .
that 's so sad .
i-i think i actually know the song .
" my pigeon home , " it 's called .
it 's a lullaby .
- lullaby ?
- mm .
so she 's trying to put us to sleep .
not working .
well , it 's a song about reuniting .
i think she might be trying to convince someone to join her .
when we met , i was the water boy for my high school basketball team , and i got stuffed in a locker after practice .
did dan save you ?
no .
i was in the one next to him .
sounds romantic .
oh , it was .
took three hours till the janitor found us .
what were you screaming , again ?
" my legs ...
i can 't feel my legs . "
sounds hilarious .
we knew if we could make it through high school together , we could make it through anything .
so far , we have .
time to go in .
take good care of him .
don 't tell me you don 't know the story of abelard and heloise .
no , but i have a funny feeling you 're about to tell me .
12th century , paris .
heloise is this whip-smart student who wants the answer to human existence .
well , that was her first mistake .
so she goes to study with pierre abelard , who 's the greatest scholar in france at the time ...
about 20 years her senior .
nothing wrong with that .
well , it was for her uncle fulbert .
he found out about their affair , beat the living crap out of abelard .
the lovers were banished to live apart forever .
they corresponded by love letters for the rest of their lives .
so ?
what do you think ?
do you ever stop talking ?
um ...
when i 'm sleeping , i guess .
oh !
well , then , night-night , professor .
oh , i 'm sorry .
you want one ?
not unless there 's weed in them .
no way .
which part of " i 'm a poetry professor "
didn 't you understand ?
well , then , what the heloise are you waiting for ?
pass me a pot cookie .
mmm !
mm-hmm .
dr. reid .
pali .
what 's up ?
i wanted to give this to her .
or to him ...
whoever 's donating to erin .
the donors are all anonymous .
i can 't give you a name .
i-i know , but the girls made me promise that i would give it to the person that helped their mommy get better .
right .
i will see what i can do .
thank you .
you don 't know what it 's like sitting there helpless while your best friend just gets sicker and sicker .
of course you know what it 's like .
you 're a doctor .
i ...
so you get why it 's so important to me that that gets to erin 's donor ?
uh , yeah , just ...
i 'm sorry .
excuse me .
is everything okay ?
larry ?
oh !
where are you going ?
home .
what ?
why ?
i 'm not doing it .
i thought i was ready , but i 'm not .
i only came in today to drop off my sister 's chair .
okay , i know that all of this has been sprung on you , and you 're probably incredibly overwhelmed , but ...
all due respect , you have no idea what i 'm going through .
i made a decision .
i 'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone .
don 't let him leave the building .
- berger is still in the building .
- what ?
that was zach .
he spotted him pacing by the coffee kiosk .
which means he 's waffling .
yes , which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his latte to get him back on board .
all right .
i got this .
hey , larry .
hi .
how do you know my name ?
my name 's dr. bishop .
it 's my first day here .
congratulations .
i 'm leaving .
hey , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
just ...
just hear me out ...
just for a second .
i just moved back here from l.a .
i was there training under this dr. pearlman .
amazing surgeon .
genius .
also ... a very pious man .
and he taught me a lot of things .
including this hebrew phrase ... " tikkun olam . "
it 's from the talmud .
it means " repairing the world . "
says all of humanity has a shared responsibility to heal and transform the world .
why are you telling me this ?
dr. pearlman , he 'd remind us about " tikkun olam "
before every surgery we did .
larry , i think you have a chance to heal the world today in the simplest , most pure kind of way .
and i know you 're scared .
i get that .
i really do .
i swear .
but i think it 's something worth considering .
and i don 't think you 'd still be here if you didn 't think so , too .
my mind 's made up .
the answer 's no .
i 'm sorry .
no .
so , there 's these , um ...
hm ?
um , you know ...
you know ...
double doors ... the kind that open in the center , and , um ...
but one of the hinges was broken , so ... they ...
they kept that locked .
but he didn 't know that .
so , anyway , you know , he 's finally ready , and he 's got , you know , his tray of cheese , you know , it 's just right .
and he 's carrying it like it 's , you know , the most precious thing in the entire world .
and then bam !
his nose goes into the glass , tray goes everywhere .
there 's , like , honey all over his beard .
oh !
oh .
i 've come unstuck .
oh !
whoopsie .
hang on .
oh !
- what the ...
- here .
let me .
here .
should you be doing this ?
why not ?
because i 'm a ...
what 'd you say ?
a beaker head with a god complex ?
no .
'cause you 're higher than a lab monkey .
what is going on here ?
um ...
relax .
josh just popped his i.v .
i got it back in .
no , you can 't do that .
i 'm sorry , but this isn 't your charge , dr. kinney .
the hell it isn 't .
i 'm a surgeon .
not in here , you 're not .
then what am i ?
i 'm sorry ?
if i 'm not a surgeon , well , what am i ?
a dead duck .
that 's ...
that 's what he said .
i didn 't ...
that 's what you implied .
in here , you 're just my patient .
right .
so , what are my chances of surviving this ?
dr. kinney .
no , seriously .
i have a reoccurrence of stage 3 metastatic breast cancer , so what are the odds i 'll be here ...
by christmas ?
that 's not fair .
you stay out of this .
as your patient , dawson , i am asking .
i do ...
i ...
i 'm not ...
i don 't feel comfortable answering that .
no .
of course you don 't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm ...
i didn 't mean to be ...
you 're all good now , josh .
thank you .
okay , then .
um ...
i 'll be back in a bit to check on you both .
great .
where did you two meet ?
uh ...
at auditions for cirque .
two total misfits .
her parents , russian immigrants , kicked her out of the house when she was 14 .
mine ... hardly even noticed i was gone .
she understood me .
yeah , i guess when you meet someone like that ... who gets you , quirks and all ... nothing else really matters , right ?
dr. harris ?
time of death ... 3 : 13 p.m .
kurt ?
let 's get him back to his room .
okay .
i don 't believe it .
it 's my fault .
i pushed him too hard .
it 's no one 's fault .
he 's never been very good with surprises .
when we were kids , i used to jump out behind corners , and one time ...
she popped out , and i hit her square in the mouth .
15 stitches .
i told you he 'd come ' round .
you were right .
i am scared .
i 've been scared my whole life .
you 've always been this golden child ...
good grades ...
good friends .
we 'll give you two some privacy .
i 've always been this neurotic mess .
that 's not true .
it is .
everyone thought it was a joke when i said i would donate .
but you stood up for me .
we 're in a good place , emma .
i don 't want it to stop .
it won 't .
you 're my brother .
that is never gonna change .
ohhh , boy .
uh , hey , alex , i need you to come take a look at this .
what do we have ?
a frozen kidney .
larry put us behind schedule .
it must have been too close to the ice for too long .
even if we thaw that , we 've got little chance of getting it to perfuse .
we 've come too far to turn back now .
so , what do you want to do ?
get me 10 bags of warm saline .
and a blowtorch .
kidding !
hold the blowtorch .
all right , then .
that freezing didn 't do us any favors , but the warm saline flush ... it looked good .
you think it 'll live ?
it has to .
okay .
suturing the renal vein .
okay .
renal vein and artery are anastomose .
okay .
moment of truth .
let 's release those clamps and pray that it takes .
exactly .
oh , come on .
come on .
let 's go .
okay .
we got good perfusion .
yes !
yoooo !
hey , do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis ?
i have to go check in on larry , make sure he 's all right .
you got it .
thanks , bishop .
how did it go ?
this is odd .
what ?
he should be waking up now .
heart rate 's skyrocketing .
alex ?
he could be having a stroke .
page shahir .
let 's get him up to imaging ... now .
okay .
good catch , alex .
it was a stroke .
he 's coning .
the swelling from the epidural bleed is pressing on his brain stem .
there .
that should relieve the pressure .
alex , it 's okay .
you can go .
i 've done plenty of these .
turn up the music , please .
thank you .
my daughter , molly , is , um ...
studying psychology at queens .
she wants to be a couples counselor , of all things .
i haven 't told her yet ...
that it 's back .
toughest thing in the world ...
watching your kid trying to be brave ...
no matter how old they are .
especially when you know the real truth .
yeah , i 'd like to apologize for that .
no .
why ?
it 's the truth .
okay .
then i say we - we double down on this ... " stranger on a train " vibe we got going here .
let 's tell each other one thing that we 've never told another living soul .
okay .
yeah ?
who goes first ?
i don 't know .
you want to rock , paper , scissors ?
oh , careful .
you 're gonna pull out your i.v. again .
i 'll go .
i don 't want to do this again .
i don 't want to sit here , getting sicker and sicker .
i want to ...
i want to get on a plane .
i want to fly away .
your turn .
well , i want to come with you .
if looks could kill , i 'd be the ghost right now .
well , look at it this way .
what would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep alex away from you ?
so , how do we help her if she won 't talk to us ?
i don 't know .
you know , maybe he doesn 't see her , maybe he doesn 't hear her , but if he feels her , if he senses that she 's here ...
then what ?
he won 't move on , either ?
he won 't get better ?
that 's a bit of a stretch , don 't you think ?
charlie .
i 'm just saying , it 's not very scientific .
no , look .
illyana , you need to talk to us .
he needs to be with me .
it was your time .
it 's not his .
you need to accept that .
he won 't make it without me .
he 's gonna have to try .
i won 't go without him .
i can 't .
something 's wrong .
illyana , what are you doing ?
i love him too much .
his heart rate 's through the roof .
you need to go now !
i can 't .
i won 't .
he 's got a petechial rash .
we need to get him to radiology right now .
could be a fat embolus in his lungs .
bone marrow may have seeped out of the break and migrated .
- can you fix him ?
- i don 't know .
come on .
illyana !
stop !
call the code .
we need a crash cart .
look , charlie .
code blue , e.t. wing 203 .
code blue , e.t. wing 203 .
kurt never had a chance .
i 'm really not in the mood to see the bright side .
people who love each other that much belong together , even in death .
i 'm not buying that .
sorry .
i had a daughter .
maddie .
it was 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
not even happy hour .
this guy 's all over the road .
he 's coming right at us .
i tried to get out of the way , but there wasn 't enough time .
we didn 't ...
we didn 't have enough time .
my little girl .
kris .
i wanted to die ... so i could be with her .
i 'm sorry .
i had no idea .
when i woke up in the hospital ...
she was gone .
but there were all these other spirits that only i could see .
there 's still so much i 'm trying to figure out about this ...
this thing we have .
well , maybe we could help each other , you know ?
figure this thing out together .
i 'd like that , charlie .
last ones .
i 'm glad to see you .
yeah , model patients .
transplants went off without a hitch .
pali , your kidney is taking a little trip to close out the domino .
it 's going to somebody who desperately needs it .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
you were badass , alex .
yeah , she 's not wrong .
all right , girls .
on to recovery ice cream .
ahh !
so ?
so , he 's gonna make a full recovery .
thank god .
one more transport to go , alex , and you 've pulled it off .
not me ... all of us .
hey .
nice ride .
oh , yeah .
thanks .
how 'd it go ?
exhausting , but , um ... eventful .
alex .
i met a boy .
at chemo ?
yes .
and he 's a poet .
and he asked to come to paris with me because he wants to show me where abelard and heloise are buried .
dana .
and i said " yes . "
you just started chemo .
i know , but i 'm ...
i 'm thinking that i just have to fight this in a different way for a while .
i 'm sorry , but this is insane .
actually , i think this is the sanest thing i have done in a long time .
you 're flying off to paris with a poet that you met a few hours ago .
well , when you put it like that ...
instead of prolonging your life ...
alex .
i don 't want to prolong my life .
i want to live it .
hey .
how you feeling ?
like i just got run over .
you ?
same .
i wanted to , um ...
well ...
i , um ...
i wrote you something .
oh , it 's a ... - limerick , yeah . - yeah .
uh ...
it was the only rhyme scheme i could remember , and i 'm half-irish , so ...
" a terminal lass from kilbride was befuddled by fear and by pride . "
hm .
" till she heard a sweet man say he 'd come with her partway .
so she kissed him , she smiled , and she cried . "
thank you , doctor .
so ...
how does it end ?
the story ?
oh .
- heloise .
- right .
does she find the real meaning of life ?
oh , she does .
oh , yeah ?
the love she found with abelard ...
that was the meaning of human existence .
oh .
love .
hey . what 's going on ?
nothing .
you ready ?
look , i get it , greg is your jacob , but we all know you 're going to end up with edward .
because you 're bella .
what is that reference ?
it 's on the tip of my tongue .
it 's ...
twilight .
twilight , yes .
it 's only the greatest love story
- since shakespeare ... in love . - right .
yeah .
right , yeah , okay .
what are you talking about again ?
you spent thanksgiving with greg , and that was not part of our plan .
you need to be with josh .
if not for you , then for me .
- why ?
- i need this .
my marriage is like the walking dead , okay ?
we are all just trying to get out alive .
you and josh , your love story ... it gives me hope .
what love story ?

oh , is that greg again ?
look at that .
he has texted you six times already today .
yeah , because he is my friend .
we 're friends .
we 're gonna go to a movie as friends .
it 's like he 's a stalker .
okay ?
no one likes a stalker .
the eagle and the bitch have landed .
really ?
let me see .
let me see . let me see .
um , joshy , do you need , um , glasses ?
because the door is right over there .
oh . my bad , babe .
okay , well ... i hope they like the rice cooker i got them .
everyone likes rice , right ?
it 's a very versatile grain .
what ?
are you crazy ?
you don 't want them snuggling up over the one dish that connects their cultures .
i 'm gonna go give them this gift . okay .
- i 'll be right back , okay ?
- forget the gift .
forget about the gift .
i am just trying to snap you back into reality , because now that josh and valencia are living together , you are not gonna have any more alone time with him .
well , you know what ?
i just want him to be happy .
oh , my gosh , joshy , i 'm so glad we finally moved in together .
it 's the beginning of our happily ever after .
yes , it 's cool .
plus , we 'll be close to ...
marriage ?
kids ?
i was going to say taco bell .
there 's only one thing missing .
the salsa ?
you just ask for it .
no , furniture , joshy .
i mean , we don 't even have a dining room table .
but we 'll get one .
let 's burn sage .
shoot , i forgot to get that .
joshy , i needed that sage to cleanse the house of evil spirits .
ghosts are obsessed with me .
i 'll get it right now .
i love you .
ugh , i hate her .
she 's worse than all the kardashians combined .
except for caitlyn , who is a national hero .
i 'm just gonna call josh and see if it 's cool that i come over .
do you need me to call valencia from a burner phone and tell her there 's been a murder at the yoga studio so you and josh can have more alone time ?
you came up with that way too quickly .
oh , he pressed " ignore " "
oh ... oh ... that doesn 't feel good .
it 's fine , it 's fine .
he 's busy .
i get it , i 'm busy , too !
i won 't even think about it .
i don 't want to feel this way .
i reject this feeling .
i respectfully decline this feeling .
hey , here she is !
here 's my mvp .
you ready to kick butt at that meeting ?
calvin young is the most important potential client we have ever had .
i 'm joking .
i mean , he is .
i mean , landing him would make us west covina 's premiere law firm .
but , by the time you knock his socks off today , wine and dine him over the weekend and then do your presentation on monday , he will be ... putty in our hands .
- oh . - are you okay ?
i mean , you look a little peaked .
never felt better . uh-huh .
i definitely won 't press ignore ... on this case .
what ?
" mr. young , i know that you have your choice of law firms
" to represent you in this matter
" of josh moving into a new apartment with his hot girlfriend ... " no !
i typed that ?
_
well , then , why do i have you in the office ?
huh ? gotcha there , bottle .
and here 's a health messages from tv 's favorite doctor .
do you know the signs and symptoms of the dreaded panic attack ?
well , if you don 't , you need to join me for my week long marathon where i 'm gonna teach you how to identify the symptoms , such as shortness of breath ... heart palpitations , the urge to self-medicate with drugs and booze .
he 's here !
whole firm is counting on you .
okay , i 'm coming .
scott , i am asking you to drive carpool for one day .
i do it every day .
oh ... fine .
fine , okay , whatever , i gotta go .
it 's nice to ... feel appreciated .
your perfume is delightful .
thank you .
i rubbed a magazine on myself this morning .
well , it smells like a cherub dancing in the morning dew .
i 'm calvin young .
paula proctor .
welcome to whitefeather .
are we , by chance , going to the same meeting ?
follow me .
calvin young .
nice to meet you .
hi , karen , the case assistant .
please excuse my handshake .
i have naturally damp hands .
it 's a medical condition .
i am in some studies .
shall we be seated ?
you okay ?
- may i get you some coffee , mr. young ? - yes .
uh , french press , if you have it .
french press .
mr. young , we are so excited to have this opportunity to bring you into the whitefeather family .
'cause that 's what we are .
a family that can help you acquire the industrial acreage you 're looking for .
well , i am pleased to be here , darryl .
well , we are determined to show you everything that we 're capable of .
and to do that ... i can think of no one else but our closer .
um , why don 't you take it away , there , rebecca ?
would you please take it away ?
welcome , calvin .
oh , my god , your teeth are blue .
have you been drinking the water from the toilet ?
oh , crap .
it 's ink .
must 've been from my pen cup .
welcome ... to joshfeather .
white ... feather .
oh , god .
what happened to you in there ?
that 's not the rebecca i know .
i mean , something is wrong .
karen said that she smells vodka on you .
well , that 's ridiculous .
vodka doesn 't smell .
listen , darryl , i know i didn 't bring my " a " game ...
i think you need to go home .
wait , are you taking me off the case ?
please don 't take me off the case , because if you take me off the case , that means i 'm not working and if i 'm not working , that means i have to think thoughts .
okay , you 're not off the case .
but go home and work on the presentation .
and then , when you come back on monday , i want you to be the happy rebecca that we all know and love .
such a good tip .
so helpful .
" be happy . "
hi , paula .
hey , are you okay ?
i got back with calvin 's fancy coffee and darryl said you weren 't feeling well and you went home .
yeah . yeah , my blood sugar was a little low , so i decided to just come home and really focus on the presentation all weekend .
hey , are you sure you 're cool to do the calvin dinner without me ?
well , i 'll do my best .
okay . uh , i gotta hop off .
i 'm really working hard here .
bye !
it 's important to deal with one 's feelings head-on , because repressed feelings lead to depression .
what do you know ?
repression equals depression .
that is ...
_
i 'm tired , too .
_
i 'm depressed , too .
man ... the french really know how to make depression look sexy .
♪ my eyes are dark from sadness ♪
♪ my lips are red from pain ♪

there is nothing sexy about depression , rebecca .
listen , you better get your act together , young lady , or you 're gonna run this new life off in the ditch .
how did you get in here ?
well , your depressed mind invited me in .
and by the way , this place is a dump .
you ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something , anything ?
maybe a mural ?
i don 't know about this .
are you sure this is the dining table she wants ?
i don 't know .
- i want to surprise her .
- surprise her ?
with furniture ?
she 's very picky , dude .
yeah , yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage .
you bought the kind you put in food , not the kind you scare ghosts away with .
valencia 's intense , bro .
as sexy as she is , she 's intense .
she has final approval over all your clothing .
yeah , you know ... yes .
i really miss your cargo 's .
we all do .
guys , i 'm committed to this relationship .
i want to contribute .
you know ? she 's done everything .
she picked out the apartment , she booked the moving trucks .
we 're supposed to be a team and i want to do something for her .
so we gonna do this or what ?
yes . yes , we are going to do this .
guys , we can bang this out .
according to this , it is a very simple - 72-step process . - 72-step process .
oh , hell no .
okay . we 're not doing that .
we lost hector .
what are you looking for ?
oh , my god , you 're still here .
tell it to me straight .
am i schizophrenic ?
i 'm not really here .
i 'm just in your imagination .
i mean , let 's face it :
you do have a very active imagination .
one minute , you 're walking down the street , the next minute , you 're in a big musical .
although , i gotta say ,
i did love the pretzel .
you did a good job on that one .
aw , it 's a shoelace tip .
ugh , that 's gross .
oh , my god , you 're looking for prescription meds in a drawer ?
so ?
listen , when i moved here , i thought i was okay , so i dumped them all my meds and now , you know , i realize that i 'm not okay .
i mean , look at me , i 'm falling apart here .
this is really bad .
so if i can just get my old prescription meds back , i 'll be okay .
uh , here 's a thought .
anxiety , depression ... how about you see a doctor first ?
i 'll go do that .
ten steps ahead of you .
thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice ,
dr. akopian .
what can i help you with ?
i 'm not myself right now .
we 're always ourselves , rebecca .
right . yeah .
no , so i don 't feel like myself .
this isn 't usually how i am .
like , i 'm normally very organized and focused .
sounds like you 're feeling out of control .
let 's delve into your childhood .
oh , i was afraid you 'd say that .
okay , so , i 've been through the therapy wringer ,
i 've rehashed my childhood a ton .
and i don 't really want to do it again .
like , for me and for you , frankly , i don 't want to put that on you .
so here 's what i need .
i need these .
those are the meds i was on in new york .
oh , my god .
how did your body react to all this medication ?
you must not have been able to feel a thing .
exactly .
numb as they come .
so ... scribble scribble on your pizzle pad .
rebecca , your doctor in new york is a quack .
he gave you a band-aid , not a cure .
my method would be to do some digging and figure out what 's really going on inside your mind .
and then we can discuss the appropriate medications .
so that 's great , but i need to be better by monday .
it 's a work thing , so ... we doing this ?
no , we 're not .
okay , well , you know what ?
you 'll be hearing from me on yelp .
um , where is your rest room ?
say , what time is your husband joining us ?
he bailed at the last minute .
he has rehearsal for his singing group .
and that 's more important than this ?
i don 't mind .
i 'm fine .
he does what he wants to do , i don 't care .
i do what i want to do , he doesn 't care .
it 's basically the storybook romance i dreamed of as a little girl .
aw , you see ? you guys get each other .
that 's so cool .
how are my eyebrows ?
don 't care .
they can be wonky .
few people know this , but bald eagles aren 't bald at all .
you see , the name actually derives from a word meaning " white headed . "
and being a " white feather , " well , i 've always felt very connected to our national bird .
actually , it 's my spirit animal .
may i just say this is an adorable red ?
unconventionally alluring , with the soul of a poet .
thank you .
i got it at the gas station , but in the ten-dollar bin .
in the future , you really should try some of the arizona wines .
blend those with a smooth camembert ... mmm ! heaven .
oh , i am imagining that .
mmm ... camembert .
it 's fun to say .
oh , you know what ?
let 's play a game .
you tell me everything about you , - don 't skip a thing , go . - okay .
i was born in irvine , california .
um , my favorite color is green ...
- not you . - oh .
ladies first .
of course .
i 'm sorry .
you know what ? calvin , you 're the guest , so you should go first . go ahead .
okay , well , um , i was born in prescott , but i knew a small town wasn 't for me , so i moved to the big city .
- phoenix ?
- tucson .
right .
yeah , and i , uh , met my lovely wife .
ten years of bliss ... and then she died .
it was a , uh , short and tragic illness .
the last thing she said was ...
" calvin , " be happy .
" take life and ... and grab it . "
and you should .
you should take whatever you want .
just take and grab .
i 'm gonna roll .
okay , let 's see ... pink pill with the number 55 on it ...
yes !
add medication .
i 've always wanted to take this .
- wait a minute .
- what ?
do-do i really need to tell you don 't take a pill you found on the bathroom floor next to the toilet ?
here me out , dr. phil .
it improves focus and promotes goal-directed behavior .
that 's exactly the mojo that i need .
rebecca , i know what it says , and i know what you need .
you need to focus on this :
josh could find you if he wanted to .
you have made yourself really easy to find .
you have been rejected .
rejected .
he doesn 't want you .
that 's reality .
deal with it .
no . i 'm not gonna listen to you .
you talk silly .
oh , my god .
oh , what 's that , little pill ?
" eat me , rebecca " ?
well , i think i will .
pills don 't talk .
don 't take it .
she took it .
let 's get to work .
all right , let 's see this presentation ...
what is karen doing ?
she put two spaces after a period .
what is this , 1997 ?
well , those have to go .
okay ! yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's kicking in right now .
and what are these , oxford commas ?
well , those have to go , too .
i just gotta edit this whole thing before i even start .
i would love to show you around tomorrow morning .
there 's , um , the chino hills state park , the azusa fish canyon falls .
may i be so bold as to inquire your availability and whereabouts tomorrow afternoon ?
uh , what ?
do you like jazz ?
hot jazz ?
is there any other kind ?
there 's a small place in south pasadena .
my friends who blow horn say it 's the best little jazz boite in town .
would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth licks ?
- i would . - mmm .
i would .
uh , but he 's , uh , busy .
he 's ... with rehearsal for his singing group .
he 's always busy .
and , you know , he 's not much of a licker .
what time do you want to pick me up ?
okay , so i 've been up all night and i hung the fish , painted the walls , put up the mural , cleaned out the fridge , redid the grout in the bathroom and for the finishing touch ...
you 're gonna be so excited !
christmas lights !
so , may i ask who 's crazy now ?
i never said you were crazy .
that 's a derogatory term and i don 't think it really applies to you .
where were you in my senior gender studies class ?
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , it 's time to get down to business .
but you know , before i get down to business , i 'm just gonna see what my friends are up to .
instagram , oh !
valencia posted a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom .
it says ♪ christened ...
how nice .
oh , nice to hear .
how 's that working for you ?
i don 't understand your question .
but you know what , i 'm starting to realize that maybe that pill was not what i needed .
oh , there 's a shocker .
just spare me .
spare me the wisecracks .
hey , it 's me .
you got any downers ?
is this enough of a downer for you ?
oh , my god .
i could just melt into the chair , like , like a butter lady .
that 's good .
no , that 's bad .
because i can 't get work done right now .
oh , i have an idea .
it 's the most fantastic-iest idea .
that 's not a real word .
seriously , seriously , seriously .
seriously , are you busy right now ?
honey , hi .
yeah , i-i 'll be home in , like , an hour , tops .
thanks , booboo .
valencia 's so mad at me .
we 've been here all night , and i haven 't even finished sorting the screws .
josh , there 's still time to bail .
on the table , i mean .
we were friends with you before we even met this table .
uh , the truth is none of us really even
like the current table .
i hate this table .
we don 't like , um , this table .
and you 're going to ruin your life if you stick with this table .
bros before ... tables .
i think it 's a nice thing you 're doing .
nicest thing i ever did for a girl was pull out .
hector ?
she has tandem parking , so after i 'm there for a while , i have to pull out .
which is such a pain , ' cause it feels so great just to leave it in there .
the worst is when it 's alternate side of the street parking , ' cause then i got to park it in back .
i don 't even get why there 's a spot back there .
it 's so tight .
feels more like an exit .
so then i 'm going front , back , front , back ... and it 's all dirty in the back , so when i move it to the front , then that gets all dirty .
i 'm just happy i have a spot at all .
'cause i used to have to pay .
well , that was edifying .
this burrito is a symphony .
dr. akopian 's gonna be so happy to see me .
when i pop up , she 's gonna be like ,
" whoa , you 're so chill !
i 'm gonna give you all the drugs " "
well , i want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around . hmm .
i bet her vacuum cleaner is filled with cool pharmaceuticals .
that 's such a good point !
i know .
i wonder what she has in there .
dr. akopian ?
dr. akopian , it 's me rebecca bunch !
i 'm really cool and chill now .
okay , not giving up , not giving up !
here , dr. akopian ?
oh , my god , it 's her prescription pad .
oh , i see it !
wait , she wouldn 't have left it by the window if she didn 't , like , want somebody to take it , right ?
yeah , it 's like a wizard test .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait , wait , what are you doing ?
you can 't fit through there .
yeah , yeah , i totally can .
because look at me ... look how tiny i am .
i 'm tiny ...
i 'm child-size .
i 'm a puppy .
i 'm a poodle . i 'm a shrimp .
yeah , i 'm going .
okay , yeah , all right .
oh , no , i think i 'm stuck .
oh , we forgot .
you 're small , but you got those british-nanny-sized boobs .
british nanny ...

i 'm not ready for this to end .
are you ?
you know i could
- have you both arrested ?
- i didn 't do anything .
i 'm a student .
on what grounds ?
breaking and entering .
first of all ,
i only half-entered .
and second of all , as far as the breaking goes , you have no idea of my intent to steal your prescription pad .
i do now .
but since you were both stoned when you broke in , and not in your right mind ...
i 'm willing to offer you a deal , ms. bunch .
make an appointment and start to get help and i won 't press charges against either of you .
fine . yeah . you win .
let 's do this .
i will come in here ,
i will explore my feelings , do whatever you want .
now can i have the drugs ?
we 're done here .
i 'm done .
i give up .
i 'm gonna take a nap here for just a ... year .
what about your job thingy ?
oh , god , i hope darryl doesn 't fire me .
do me a favor ?
can you get my phone ?
i think it 's in your purse .
i know , i 'm just too tired .
can you get it ?
just put it in my hand ?
just place it inside my hand .
it 's coming .
place it inside .
- there .
- thank you .
hi , paula .
it 's me .
yeah , okay , listen , i got something to tell you .
i 'm not proud of it .
i cannot do the presentation with calvin on monday .
can you tell darryl for me ?
i 'm-i 'm actually with calvin , so i could just tell him .
what ?
we are at the hotel on east cameron and he just went out for ice , and i only have a second .
hotel ?
why are you at a ho ...
is that anita baker playing in the background ?
oh , oh , he 's coming back .
i gotta go .
i need a cab .
uber .
i need an uber .
oh , okay .
actually , no , forget the uber , it 's just around the corner .
come on !
i 've never been in a hotel room with a couch before .
uh , all the perks .
i can 't believe i 'm doing this .
it 's like a fantasy ... like strawberries and champagne is just gonna magically arrive at the door .
you didn 't !
don 't do it !
look at that .
it 's beautiful !
she 's gonna love it .
i-i feel so great about this .
she 's here . she 's here , guys .
mwah . okay . okay .
what ?
left .
what is it ?
is it a puppy ?
babe , what am i looking at ?
surprise !
it 's your new dining room table .
we stayed up all night making it for you .
- that you didn 't pick out .
- and i helped .
that 's so sweet .
so , do you like it ?
well ... it doesn 't match our other things .
it 's not exactly what i would 've picked out .
oh , well , i mean , if it 's ... not something you want , i mean , i guess i ...
you could take it apart and give it back ?
josh , you are so smart .
that 's a great idea .
give me a kiss .
i got to go back to class , you guys , but thank you so much .
oh , and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table .
yeah ? okay . bye .
she scares me so bad .
look , paula ,
i know your marriage is crap .
i get it .
and i get that you 're about to have the hottest sex of your life .
mmm .
right . so why are you stopping me ?
because it 's not real .
it 's a band-aid .
you know that .
remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality , right ?
and i didn 't get it ?
now i get it .
you 're doing the exact same thing .
you need to face your real problem , and your real problem is that your marriage is dead .
and you need to fully feel that , and you need to face it , because this is just a temporary fix .
it 's like a pill you found on the bathroom floor .
who would take a pill they found on the floor ?
look , look , i 've spent my whole life numbing myself , okay ?
i have spent my whole life escaping to far-off places , and it 's only recently , like , now , like , literally this second that i realize , like , i can 't do that !
i can 't do that .
i have to feel my feelings .
it 's okay to feel , paula .
it 's been five years since i made love without the tv on .
and ten years since somebody held my hand .
i-i miss my dead wife .
come here .
literally the most entertaining day of my life .
rebecca , making a speech like that in front of a potential client , that ... was brave .
also a bit foolish .
in most cases , clients would run in the opposite direction .
and i understand if this means you don 't want to work with me ...
look , let me finish .
you have the kind of no-nonsense honesty and raw emotional insight that i look for in a commercial real estate lawyer .
you are a wonderful woman ,
this weekend has been so special .
but marriage is a precious thing .
if i could hold my wife for one more second ...
oh . don 't make me cry again .
is this alpaca ?
it 's so soft .
my dead white wife loved alpaca .
what did you say to calvin ?
he was so impressed , he 's not even seeing other people .
i mean , how did you swing that ?
i just was honest about ... about all the great work you do ,
i just made him see what you wanted him to see , that we 're a group of kick-ass lawyers and we 're a family .
feel your feelings .
everyone should feel their feelings .
everyone should always feel their feelings .
well , i , for one , am feeling peeved , because this copier ...
cork it , karen !
but this copier ...
cork it !
rebecca , i 'm very glad you 're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself .
i am so grateful to be here , and i 'm excited to face my problems head-on .
i know it 's gonna be hard work , but it 's work that i am prepared ... it 's work ...
i 'm sorry .
i know i should just ... work ,
i should make sure this isn 't an emergency .
one second .
_
you know what , i 'm feeling better already , actually .
so i 'm-i 'm gonna go to this very important thing , but i want to let you know that this is not over .
i 'll see you next week .
what ?
get out of here !
a rice cooker ?
that 's perfect !
because valencia is mexican and i 'm filipino and rice is a staple in both of our ...
cultures . yeah . right .
uh , oh , sorry it took me forever to return your call from friday .
oh , my gosh , you ... you 're so busy .
don 't even think about it .
hey , can i ask you something ?
anything .
is this a nice table ?
it 's a perfect table .
that 's what i think .
thanks .
no problem .
uh , hey , um , do you want to come over sometime , just check out the new place ?
there 's not a lot of furniture , so there 's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our socks like in risky business .
oh , my god , that sounds amazing .
yes .
when ?
now ?
just , like , don 't tell valencia , ' cause she thinks it 's stupid .
well , valencia 's stupid .
sorry . i 'm sure she 's smart in her own way .
but anyway i have the perfect slippy-slidey socks .
number 31 .
oh , no . don 't you start with me .
just keep walking , old man .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
get out of my life .
oh , my god , uh , dr. phil .
i 'm a huge fan .
- how you doing ? - oh .
i 'm s ... oh , my gosh . i 'm sorry .
you 're actually dr. phil .
in the flesh .
it 's me .
even dr. phil has got to have his boba .
i 'm addicted to these things .
maybe you should , uh , get help for that .
you guys make a really cute couple .
oh . that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
no , no , no .
we 're just friends .
that 's so funny . he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny , but we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
yeah . g-good luck to you , buddy .

previously on " angie tribeca ... "
she 's awake .
- sergeant pepper ?
- angie .
- how long have i been out ?
- about nine months .
next you 're gonna tell me you 're seeing someone else .
scholls thinks i had the baby with some chick in canada .
yeah , don 't worry about it .
who 's his mother ?
is that really important , who 's his mother ?
do people really care who their mom is ?
i 'm ready to work , lieutenant .
you just got out of a coma .
hey , if tribeca says she 's ready , then she 's ready .
or do i have to show you my fist ?
i was wondering if i could see the visitors log from when i was in a coma .
has anyone here heard of the website " meetncheat.org " ?
their server 's been hacked .
this is all the stolen data from the meet 'n'cheat hack , names and addresses of all the members on the site .
they 're making it look like the lapd is publishing it .
my name is on the list .
mayor joe perry .
username ...
mayorjoeperry1 .
password ... " yesthatmayorjoeperry . "
i 'd like to introduce you to special agent diane duran .
so , mayhem global hires duran to hack meet 'n'cheat .
she draws us in .
then she hacks us from the inside .
but why ?
sergeant pepper . i know he 's still alive .
if you 're serious about finding pepper , he 'll meet you here .
i found out that the biggest criminal is not out on the streets .
he 's in the mayor 's office .
mayor perry ?
voter fraud , racketeering , money laundering , racketeering fraud , voter laundering .
the list goes on and on .
what about mayhem global ?
i am mayhem global .
there 's one number programmed into this phone .
when you 're ready to be part of the revolution , call it .
what 's the point of any of this ?
we have evidence , a confession , and the bad guy doesn 't spend one night in jail ?
- that 's the system , tribeca .
- the system sucks .
pieced it all together ?
almost .
now i 'm done .
currently on " angie tribeca ... "
you 're just perfect .
we 're gonna take such good care of you .
the freezematic 15,000 .
once this bad boy gets going , it 's gonna chill your milk , preserve your meat , call your sister , cure hepatitis .
just sign there .
yep . you 're looking at 28 cubic feet of self-regulated , vacuum-sealed cold .
that 's a separate produce crisper with an independent temperature control .
check out this freezer .
a dead body fro ...
that 's not supposed to be there .
but i just plugged it in , and it 's already ice-cold .
that 's pretty good .
tell us what happened .
well , growing up , i always thought i 'd be a pro football player , but i got a bum knee , so went into the family business ... real estate .
market takes a tumble , here i am .
how about what happened today .
got up about 4 : 30 , hit the snooze button ... just the one time ... got up , showered .
at work , sir .
what happened at work ?
let 's see .
i got to where i pick up the truck for deliveries .
finally .
i pull into the parking structure .
level " a " is full , level " b " is full .
level " c , " there was a compact spot , but i made it work .
what 's the name of the company you work for ?
golden gate fridge .
i am sick and tired of being sick and tired .
councilman dreyfuss is airing out all of mayor perry 's dirty laundry .
is this who you want leading your city for another four years ?
he actually has some good points .
it 's too bad the old guy doesn 't have a shot .
he 'd need a miracle to win .
and what are the odds of two miracles in one month ?
not likely .
so , where are we on the body in the fridge ?
we 're waiting on scholls for an i.d. and a cause of death .
i talked to someone at the refrigerator company .
they 're gonna send someone out to talk to us between the hours of 4 : 00 and 8 : 00 .
wow , that 's a huge window .
no appointments ?
you can get a specific time , but you have to wait like three weeks .
okay , so i 'll have tanner wait around for the fridge guy .
you guys check in with scholls and see if she has a name for us .
will do , lieutenant .
so , i tried calling you this weekend .
yeah , i dropped my phone in the toilet .
total write-off .
and then i immediately got this new one with a different number .
but we 're still on for bowling tonight .
yeah , actually , i can 't .
i dropped my bowling ball in the toilet .
total write-off .
and then i immediately got this one .
but the guy told me to wait a couple days until the marble settles .
ah , tribeca , geils .
come with me .
i want to show you something .
disgusting , isn 't it ?
- horrible .
- a cat did that .
anyway ...
how can i help you ?
we were wondering if you were able to i.d. the fridge corpse .
ah , the very cold case , yes .
come with me .
i want you to see something .
the deceased 's name is charles michael bucket , and his fingerprints match exactly those of a sailor who 's been missing for three days .
- navy ?
- worse . coast guard .
dr. scholls , can you show the detectives what you showed me ?
trying to make me jealous ?
- is that a whistle ?
- in his windpipe .
and something tells me he wasn 't born with it .
although he did die with it .
we think someone shoved a whistle down his throat after a struggle .
you can see the defensive wounds here and here .
why a whistle ?
someone trying to send a message ?
don 't blow whistles ?
someone 's telling him not to be a whistle-blower .
but what was he blowing the whistle on ?
no idea .
we examined every other orifice several times but found no evidence .
we 'll try and take out the whistle and see if we can pull some dna .
meanwhile , we 'll go pay a visit to the coast guard .
the commandant 's a very busy man , you know .
we appreciate you getting us in , petty officer snick .
chief petty officer snick , thank you very much .
and i thought you said you were coming at 2 : 00 .
isn 't it 2 : 00 ?
it 's 1 : 50 , which means i only got a 20-minute lunch break , but whatever .
it 's fine . i 'll have a candy bar or something .
sorry , petty officer .
we didn 't think it was a big deal .
detectives , commandant don van zandt .
come in , detectives .
that 'll be all , snick .
you 're welcome .
first of all , i 'd like to thank you for finding seaman bucket .
we are a brotherhood , and when one of our brothers go missing , it hurts the whole coast guard family .
if there 's anything that i could do to assist in your investigation , don 't be afraid to ask .
well , for starters ...
i 'm afraid that 's all the time that i 've got today .
cpo snick will see you out .
we were really hoping to ask you some questions ,
commandant don van zandt .
i know you were , detective . i know you were .
you listen here , popeye .
this is a murder investigation , and we 're the murder police .
so start talking .
i think you 're outside of your jurisdiction , detective .
this is an internal matter for the coast guard , thus to be handled internally by the coast guard with no outside help .
all due respect , commandant , this base is in l.a. county , so when somebody 's killed in l.a. , it is very much in our jurisdiction .
now , we 'd like to interview his bunk mates . we want to talk to the last person who saw him alive , and we want to know why he ended up dead in a refrigerator .
i don 't know how he disappeared or why he ended up in that refrigerator or how he got that whistle down his throat , but if our investigation turns up anything of interest , i 'll be sure to call you .
cpo snick will see you out .
we 'll see ourselves out .
okay . it 's my one job , but go ahead .
we need base access , we need to interview his shipmates , but the coast guard keeps shutting us down at every turn .
because they know something that they don 't want to tell us .
it 's a classic case of keeping something secret .
if they want to get into a jurisdictional dick-measuring contest , i 'm all for it .
it sounds like fun , and i like my chances .
go talk to the melanie burke at the d.a. ' s office and see if she can help us out .
got it .
- lieutenant . - yep ?
as predicted , the refrigerator guy came as soon as i got in the shower .
damn it !
that 's so frustrating .
it 's like they know .
so i can either wait till tomorrow at the same time , or i can go to the warehouse in long beach and talk to them .
that 's a hell of a long drive , but i don 't think it can wait .
i 'll be all right .
there 's a dave buster 's right next door .
tanner !
i 'm gonna go with you .
this guy 's going to the chair .
as god as my witness , he 's gonna fry .
just backing up a bit , we don 't know who did it .
yeah , but we appreciate your enthusiasm .
someone showed up to work today .
all right , what do you guys want , huh ?
just tell me what you want , and i 'm gonna put it in your little hands .
all right ? you want a court order ?
you want a subpoena ?
you want a grand jury ?
i 'm gonna get you a grand jury .
we 're not quite there yet , melanie , but good to know we have you in our back pocket .
all right , so hit me . anything .
give it to me .
well , i guess we could start by getting subpoenas
- for some of bucket 's shipmates .
- already done .
how about a search warrant ?
check your inbox . already there . did it this morning .
- can i use your restroom ?
- you just did .
- validate parking ?
- i would love to .
parking .
got here at 10 : 21 .
it 's 11 : 04 now , so that 's ... that 's ... that 's 28 ... 28 minutes .
no , that 's like 40 minutes .
shh . okay . these are 15-minute increments .
- there we go .
- we 'll just pay .
- i got this .
- please , just give us our ticket back .
can you just ...
'cause i had it , and now i don 't have it .
- just give it back .
- this one is ...
you can stick it together .
ahh ... oh . they 're not lickies .
it 's fine .
this is great . thank you .
come on , guys ! hurry up !
i told you . i don 't know anything about no body in no fridge .
so , no one looks into the refrigerators when you take them off the boat ?
of course . every product gets quality-controlled .
nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fridge ?
when my guys checked it , there was no body , okay ?
my guys know what they 're doing .
lieutenant , i 'm gonna need you to look away for this one .
mr. sterelli , let me ask you something .
how do you feel about dave buster 's ?
it 's the number-one destination for family fun .
- everybody knows that . - mm .
how about if i told you i had 5,000 tickets with your name all on them ?
i 'm listening .
have you had any interaction with the coast guard ?
they come around sometimes , make sure the shipments get through with no hassles .
what shipments ?
they don 't tell me nothing , and i don 't ask nothing .
every once in a while , a shipment of appliances comes off through the boat that i 'm not allowed to inspect .
they put it in a coast guard truck and take it off my hands .
that 's all i know .
anything else , you 're gonna have to ask the coast guard .
thank you , mr. sterelli .
thank you very much .
excuse me !
excuse me , seamen and women !
we 're wondering if anybody has any information on the death of charlie bucket .
i got information .
but if you want me to talk , you got to beat me .
not you .
the other lady .
seaman bucket was my bunk mate .
we were closer than brothers .
i know this is difficult , but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him ?
no .
no idea .
he was a great sailor and really popular , although , the last couple weeks , it did seem like he really had something on his mind .
i 'd say to him , " hey , charlie . you got something on your mind ? "
and he would say , " huh ? what ? "
like he had something on his mind .
you have any idea what happened to his stuff ... clothes , footlocker , detailed diary ?
yeah , i did find one detailed diary .
i didn 't think anything of it at the time .
you want to take a look at it ?
it might help .
yo .
" smash mouth " is two words .
a coast guard truck ? this late ?
we should go check it out .
we don 't have a warrant .
oh , i think we 'll be okay .
what the hell was that ?
i can 't wink .
tanner , hit the siren .
evening , detectives .
- is it ?
- how can i help you ?
how 's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look-see ?
i 'm afraid i can 't do that , detective .
i 'm on official coast guard business , so unless you want to take it up with the president of the united states ...
i 'll do that .
president obama , lieutenant pritikin atkins .
is it okay if we look inside a coast guard truck ?
thank you .
good night , sir .
- wait , can i talk to him ?
- oh . he hung up .
is he buying it ?
it 's hard to read his face .
what 's he doing now ?
he 's still looking with a suspicious look on his face .
what are you two whispering about ?
vitamins .
ke $ ha .
vice president .45 says open the back of the truck .
hey , how 's it going , eh ?
are we in america ?
canadians ?
what in the name of tim hortons is going on here ?
mr. president , we have a situation .
i didn 't know the coast guard deals in the trafficking of illegal immigrants .
there 's a lot you don 't know , detective , like how to apply eyeliner or who won best picture in 1984 .
" amadeus . "
what were you doing with a truckload of canadians ?
answer me !
okay , you want to play that game ?
well , we just found your dna on the whistle inside of seaman bucket 's throat , so you 're going down either way .
if you cooperate , maybe we can get the charges reduced .
i don 't have to answer to you . i only answer to one man .
but there is one tiny bit of information you should know .
i have a horrible shellfish allergy .
- whoa , put down the shrimp !
- don 't do it , man . no .
put it down .
no . that 's no way to go out .
- nice knowing you , detectives .
- not like this !
- put the shrimp do ...
- oh , and angie ,
- sergeant pepper says hello .
- don 't do it , man !
- dreyfuss for mayor ! - no ! no !
this is great .
case closed .
we got our murderer , and we didn 't have to watch a jury screw it up .
who wants to see a flick ?
this isn 't over .
we have to go after van zandt .
there 's a massive conspiracy going on here .
officer snick put a shrimp in his mouth just to protect it .
i don 't want to do 3-d . it makes me dizzy .
we cannot trust the coast guard to investigate itself .
i 'm not gonna stand here and watch this get lost in the shuffle .
tribeca , the buck has officially been passed .
it 's immigration and jag corp 's problem now .
we all want to put the bad guys away and see the good guys get it all wrapped up nicely , which is why i 'm thinking we see " jack reacher " at 8 : 15 .
i saw it .
brown stuff . rocks .
when did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good ?
sometimes i think we 'd make more of a difference without the badge .
you 've just been so different lately .
i 'm still incredibly attracted to you .
but something 's changed .
i 'm in a bad place , geils .
you don 't want any part of this .
we 're doing good , angie .
we 're making a difference .
at the end of the day , you just got to leave the job at the job .
you 're right .
guess i 'm just having a bad year .
i 'm gonna call it a night .
angie , promise me you won 't do anything crazy .
i promise .
set a course for dreamland .
relax .
i 'm not here to arrest you .
or sleep with you .
take me to pepper .
never .
ahh , ahh , aah ! your feet are freezing !
okay , i 'll take you !
so , what are the canadians for ?
are you putting together some kind of army ?
not soldiers .
voters .
it 's right up here on the right .
- face forward .
- thanks , commandant .
i 'm done with you .
here 's your chapstick back .
drive .
not until you tell me what the hell you 're up to .
you know what i see when i look out this window ?
no .
no more bullshit .
you 're importing canadians to vote for dreyfuss ? what is this ?
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
he 's gonna win . he 's killing dreyfuss in the polls .
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
one way or another , he 's gonna lose , and there isn 't a damn thing you can do abo ...
i 'm in .
oh . really ?
i thought that was gonna be a lot harder .
great . good news .
where do we start ?
just act normal , and at a certain point , the commandant will contact you .
i 'm really happy you 're joining us , angie .
previously on crazy ex-girlfriend ...
whatever happened with you and your ex ?
ex ?
oh , greg , i 'm sorry .
- do you love her ?
- no .
you forgive me ?
of course , i forgive you , joshy .
love doesn 't work out for me , ever .
so you are unhappy .
yeah . duh .
maybe it 's time you see what else is in your life , besides josh chan .
oh , my gosh , you have changed my life ,
dr. dream ghost akopian .
you made me see past all of my delusions that were holding me back .
josh , you don 't understand ?
you don 't see what this has all been about for rebecca ?
rebecca , are you in love with me ?

why do you have all these photos ?
yep , okay , so here 's what happened .
i had ... have ... had feelings for you , indeed , yes .
god , this is awkward , um , i came here to tell you that valencia ...
valencia and you are staying together .
- no ... i-i-i i gathered . - yeah .
i get it and that makes sense , yeah .
josh , i 'm actually very glad you 're here , because , um , i realized some things on my recent trip .
and , um , one of the things i realized is that i need to break my old patterns .
okay .
yes , uh , starting with ...
i 've been horrible to valencia , like , really horrible , and i really want to reach out to her .
- i really wouldn 't .
- i really think i should .
she really hates your guts .
understandable , and i will just have to transcend that .
i am trying to break free of anything unhealthy or damaging .
so , um , that starts with , uh , trashing these .
unless you want them .
no , no , that 's okay .
although , um , you know , some of those are great angles that you can 't get with a selfie , so , uh ...
- sure , yeah , yes . - yeah .
thanks .
okay , well , there it is .
that 's the last of the josh chan stuff .
there was stuff ?
no .
well , i guess i should go .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . of course , get out .
- get out of here . - yeah , yeah .
bye , josh .
can i get another beer ?
i 'm trying to study .
studying and drinking at the same time : good decision .
i know , right ?
it 's easy .
it 's extension school .
i-i don 't like to tell a lot of people this , but i got into emory business school .
it 's a pretty good school .
they call it like the harvard of the south .
i thought the harvard of the south was vanderbilt .
no . no . no .
yeah , so i got into school , and then my dad got sick , so now i 'm working my way through school here .
you know ?
i can 't be slinging drinks to losers until i 'm like 60 years old .
oh , boy , look at this .
just what i need .
- hi . - hey .
i thought you drank at home base .
i drink anywhere , but i do my study-drinking here .
got it .
can i pull up a stool next to you , or do you want to ... be alone ?
i could go home and drink some mouthwash .
mouthwash , wow .
that 's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself .
sad says the man with an open textbook ... next to an open container .
this is fun .
i like this .
do you want to hang out for a while and insult each other ?
ah , what would your girlfriend think about that ?
um , heather ?
uh , yeah , no , we 're done-zo .
oh , wow . i had no idea .
can i get you a drink ?
nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snark .
wait .
go back to the heather thing .
are you okay ?
let 's-let-let 's talk .
talk is not on the bar menu , but we could ask .
okay , so , yeah , here 's the thing .
old me would have been totally down for , like , an old-fashioned barb fest , but i 've decided recently that i 'm trying to change my patterns .
so i 'm gonna go .
no , come on . come on .
i 'm a glutton for punishment .
stay . let 's do this .
we can make bad decisions together .
we could run in traffic .
no ?
okay .
boy , she really digs you .
she 's in love with someone else , but i figure ten , 11 years of me trying ,
i 'm a lock .
okay , what is happening ?
why are you throwing out all this josh stuff ?
i told you , i 've gone cold turkey on the chan .
i 'm done .
it 's not good for me , and you know that .
d ... oh , g ... you have to keep the macaroni portrait .
that took two weeks .
no , no , paula , i 'm breaking my old patterns .
break old pat ... i ...
what does that even mean ?
did you go to a bumper sticker store ?
no , i just realized a lot of things on my trip to new york , while i was in a bumper sticker store .
okay , but you 're right about this , actually , it has a lot of dry goods on it , it actually could be useful for my earthquake kit ,
- so i will keep this .
- that 's my girl .
but everything else goes in the trash .
- hmm , hmm . - oh , come on .
not channy bear .
i forbid it .
fine , maybe i 'll just put channy bear on a high shelf in case of a ... bear-mergency .
but the rest of this is going , bye .
- oh , come on ... - bye , letters to josh .
first drafts , second drafts .
- in the trash .
- no .
- yep .
- that 's ...
- that 's insanity . - nope .
nope .
good-bye , josh thong that i never wo ... i don 't wear thongs .
why did i even get this ?
you have finally lost it .
you have left the reservation and i-i can 't ... i 'm not ...
i can 't watch it . i don 't care . i don 't care .
i 'm not supporting this .
no , uh-uh .
hey ... i 'm so nervous , aren 't you ?
that last test ...
was pretty easy , at least for me .
wow , that 's impressive .
you must be smart .
yeah , well .
i-i don 't like to tell people this , but , um ...
oh , you don 't have to tell me something you don 't like to ...
i got into the harvard of the south .
emory ?
you know it ?
emory ?
the harvard of the south is duke .
no .
no , no .
emory . google it .
so , everyone , overall there were some nice efforts , but , uh , some of you , i 'm sad to say , fell short .
i 'm really not sure what rubric you 're using to grade these , but ...
doesn 't take much of a rubric to see that you didn 't put in much of an effort here .
oh , well , you know , i work full-time .
my dad is sick .
i work two jobs and my husband is dead .
i am very sorry to hear that , but i ... was not involved .
your next assignment is an essay due friday .
you can do better , mr. serrano .
you got into the harvard of the south , after all , which you somehow managed to mention on your test .
a multiple choice test .
so , you 're busting my balls about an intro class at an extension school ?
cool , yeah . makes sense .
look , i don 't know you very well , but from where i stand , it seems like you 've made the choice not to try or something .
oh , please , don 't you worry about my decisions .
i will decide about my decisions .
choosing not to try , greg .
you got into emory , greg .
i mean , duh , i could have done better .
i could have gotten an " a " on that test if i 'd wanted to .

you 're an idiot .
oh , my god , this is nuts .
okay , you can 't give up on josh right now .
you are so close .
paula , he picked valencia .
like , in front of my face .
game over .
what ?
no .
game has just begun .
okay , you have antibodies to his saliva .
you cannot give up .
you have traction .
he-he touched the side of your boob , i saw it .
- can you get whoever that ...
- yeah , i will get that .
and ... just ... let 's continue the convo later , okay ?
and if it 's the people across the street from that church , just tell them i don 't believe and will never believe .
rebecca .
hello , everyone in josh 's family .
hi .
oh , my gosh .
i haven 't seen you since the last book club .
i haven 't seen you got engaged .
how does it feel ?
it feels like i 've been waiting seven years for phillip to propose , because i have .
let me see the rock .
oh , my gosh , i mean ,
phillip said he was going for it , but ...
he said you were so helpful getting it .
oh , it was no problem at all .
i helped my client , moshe , through a very complicated subdivision deal , and he said he could hook me up with non-blood diamonds at a discount .
and never pass up a good discount , right ?
i know what you 're thinking ...
like , diamonds , discounts , those are some like classic jew moves , you know ?
what are you doing here ?
jayma has something to ask you .
look , i know that this is sudden , and we haven 't known each other that long ...
god , i feel like i 'm proposing or something .
you 've been such a good friend to the family .
you wrote jastenity that letter to get into harvard .
unfortunately the letter was better than her application , but she did get into cal state northridge , which is the harvard of northridge .
yeah , it is .
anyway , what i 'm trying to say is , how would you like to be a bridesmaid at my wedding ?
you mean , be an official part of the chan fam-bam ?
she 'd love to .
you want me to be a bridesmaid .
aw , you 're such a lovely girl , rebecca .
we would be so honored if you would become a part of our family wedding .
and you are the perfect height to pair with phillip 's friend , daniel , who stopped growing after being a kid gymnast .
um , actually , i-i don 't know if i should .
okay , hey , why don 't we just ... ?
o-one second , chan ladies .
come here .
one ...
one-one second .
okay , this would kill valencia .
dead .
down in the ground .
like a bug .
legs in the air .
now she 's a ghost , boo .
okay , but , paula , what have i been saying ?
i need to disengage and disentangle from dis family .
know what i 'm saying ?
seriously , i-i want to make amends to valencia , and this is like the opposite of that .
yeah , okay , well , who says no to being a bridesmaid ?
you can 't do that .
i mean , who does that ?
monster people .
- i have a question .
- no .
is valencia a bridesmaid ?
uh , not exactly .
by that she means no .
like , ew , no .
here 's the thing , i-i 'd love to be a bridesmaid , but i don 't think it would be fair for me to be a bridesmaid and for valencia not to be .
i guess you 're right .
and josh has asked for valencia to be a bridesmaid about 50 times , so ...
great , so you get what i 'm trying to say .
so you can both be in the wedding .
sorry , what 's that ?
you and valencia can both be bridesmaids .
that way you don 't have to worry about her not being included .
very wise , jayma .
it 's settled , then .
yeah , it is !
i know you , from spider 's .
you were the sourpuss fighting with the girl in the shiny dress .
hey , i 'm , i 'm not a sourpuss .
i 'm pensive and deep .
are you dusting potatoes ?
i like to look busy .
well , you 're out of dark roast .
i can 't study without dark roast .
could you get on that ?
oh , yeah , sure , uh , no problemo .
thanks .
she 's cute .
are we being pleasant now ?
sorry , i don 't know your rules .
so , you two an item ?
me and ally ?
oh , i wish .
she quit her job as a manager at a whole foods , came to work here .
i could not figure out why for the longest time .
and then i realized ...
hey , i know that guy .
♪ grocery clerk with half an eyelid . ♪
his name is brody .
i can 't compete with him .
he has the flattop of a greek god .
this !
whoa , you are so good at magic .
how do you do it ?
uh-uh-uh . a true magician never reveals his secrets .
come on , brody .
so you like her .
yeah .
i don 't have a shot .
i mean , look at her .
i should give up .
i know that 's the right decision .
are you sure ... she doesn 't like you ?
watch this .
ally .
ally , though .
that 's my type , too .
oh , that 's so hot .
okay , bro , i gotcha .
i know exactly what you need to do .
so , you and valencia are friends ?
uh , kinda .
i 'd say we share a history of common interests .
of course , she 's late .
she 's the kind of person that has to make an entrance .
you know what ? i don 't think that 's fair .
i wouldn 't stereotype her as someone that ...
oh , sorry i 'm late .
i just had some pictures taken for my hometown hotties submission to maxim .
we ready to try on some dresses ?
jas , come on .
let 's go pick out the first round of dresses .
this is beautiful .
- hey . - whoa !
hey , valencia , hi , oh , uh , this is going to be so fun .
are you ready to be , like , bridesmaid buddies ?
i want to make myself very , very clear .
i know what happened .
i know about the kiss .
and if it were any other situation , i would take off my earrings , my extensions , and my wings , and curb-stomp you .
got it , that 's fair .
but , for some reason , you 're the one that got me into this wedding party .
josh told me it was all you .
- he did ? - yep .
i mean ,
i don 't know why you did it , but i don 't care .
just stay out of my way and don 't make me look bad to these people .
hey , valencia , i can do better than that .
i can make you look good .
yeah , yeah , like , by the end of this , they 're going to want to adopt you .
but maybe that 's not , like , precisely what you want , but ...
oh , just shut up .
how about this ?
this seems like a style that would work on everyone .
well , most of us .
valencia 's right .
uh , you know , uh , two-piece , halter , mesh dress might work well for you very lean ladies , but , yeah , not for this festival of back fat going on .
okay , well , what about ... this ?
oh , my god .
those are such beautiful nipple covers .
yeah , those would definitely cover most of my nipples .
yeah , guys , let me remind you , i eat bagels at night ...
valencia knows .
she knows all about my night bagels ... tell ' em , v .
here 's what you didn 't know .
for my midnight bagel , i eat it with butter , cream cheese , and ... bacon .
seriously . s-r-s-l-y .
like , true story .
okay , so why don 't we try different styles in the same color ?
that 's a great idea .
that 's so ni ...
you know what ? i 'm gonna go out on a limb and say that 's , like , really gracious .
it is , actually , a , a good idea .
so you kids can go crazy with your halters and your sheaths and your cutouts , and i will wear a dress fit to upholster a chair .
and i will wear it with pride .
rebecca , come on .
yeah , you 're not that disgustingly fat .
aw , thank you , valencia .
thank you .
paula .
what have we said about standing places , quietly waiting for people ?
i forgot .
okay , so how did it go with valencia at the dress shop ?
did you find any weaknesses ?
i was thinking that we could use your role as bridesmaid to really mess her up .
my first thought was poison oak in the dress .
rashy nips , instant classic . paula .
what ?
we 're not doing any of that .
- we 're not .
- no .
we 're just acting like normal people .
i 'm going to be like any other teenage ex-boyfriend 's sister 's last-minute bridesmaid .
yeah , so just be cool .
understood .
i have my orders .
where can a person buy poison oak , and what is the rashiest kind ?
richard kind is a 59-year-old actor , best known for his role in spin city .
no . poison oak , rashiest kind .
jim rash is the award-winning writer of the descendants .
come on .
you 're sure this is a good idea ?
dude , she doesn 't like you .
she 's shown no interest .
she 's way into someone else .
why give up now ?
this is the right move .
um , can i have everyone 's attention , please ?
hey , someone 's trying to let it rip here .
- thank you , greg .
- you 're welcome .

the case ? who cares about the case ?
when are you getting the bridesmaid gowns ?
'cause i got a guy in maine who 's going to send me some primo itchy , sticky plants .

guys .
there 's something i need to tell you .
and it won 't be easy .
my dress is done early , and i brought champagne !
cheers !
valencia 's so funny .
oh , valencia , tell them about the part with the old lady .
yeah , so , this 90-year-old lady was in downward dog , and i said to her , " okay , just breathe into it . "
and she said ,
" if i breathe into it any harder , i 'm gonna toot . "
oh , she 's so funny .

she 's not wrong , ruby .
you 're a dud .
ah , man , i am tipsy .
this was so fun .
oh , jas , we got to go meet mom at the cake-tasting .
can you guys stay and make skee the dress gets packed away perfectly ?
like no wrinkles or bubbles .
absolutely .
we 're on it .
valencia and i got this .
yep , we got it .
thanks , v .
you know , we all thought you were heinous , but you 're kind of okay .
- all right , bye , ladies .
- bye , jayma .
drink a glass of water .
they don 't think i 'm heinous anymore .
jastenity even offered me a half stick of gum .
i said no because i bloat , but still ...
congrats .
well , i guess we should , um , get the girls to pack up this big-ass dress .
yeah , okay .
wow , this would look even worse on me than some of the others .
oh , come on , stop .
i mean , you make jokes about your body , and they 're pretty funny and mostly accurate , but with your big boobs , that dress would look great .
are you kidding ?
no .
i 'd be spilling out of this thing , and not like in a sexy , on purpose ,
christina hendricks type of way .
so ?
guys don 't care .
guys love big boobs like yours .
i mean , sometimes i hate my small boobs .
i mean , i thought about getting implants .
what ?
no , don 't do that .
oh , my gosh , valencia , if you knew what went into having a pair of monsters like these , you would never think about getting them again .
i 'm gonna show you .
rebecca , you can 't .
it 's too dangerous here .
i 'll try to go to paris on my own .
meet me there .
i love you .
the french government has fled to tours .
by god , france is collapsing !
we should declare independence .
send us garibaldi and algeria will take care of itself , just like italy .
you want us to fight 3 million arabs all by ourselves ?
- what are the other wires ?
- nothing important .
say , what do you think of ...
what 's wrong ?
" on the front , the incredible bravery " of the ' chasseurs d 'afrique , ' algerian soldiers and zouaves ,
" cost them dearly .
" the second ' turcos ' was bled dry .
" its officers were killed in action . "
shit .
the second " turcos ... " that 's aissa 's regiment !
friends ...
military rule is over .
algeria has been split into 3 departments governed by french law .
the departments will be run by a prefect and by members of parliament .
the governor-general must now be a civilian , under the ministry of the interior .
we 've won , my friends !
algeria is both civilian and french !
a french algeria !
- long live french algeria !
- wait . settle down . there 's more .
the 33,000 algerian jews are now automatically french .
- will we be allowed to vote ?
- of course .
- what about the arabs ?
- not for now . phew !
my heart stopped .
shut up !
thousands of " turcos " and zouaves died on the battlefield . they voted with their blood .
a minute of silence for our muslim brothers who died for france .
why did you keep that from me ?
i had made a promise .
how could you keep such a secret to yourself this long ?
" dear father , " you reading this letter means i was killed in action . "
" don 't cry .
" i 'll gladly give france the life you 've given me " that has nothing left in store for me .
" i will finally rest in peace " under the watchful eye of the 2 gods who ruled " over my life and death . "
" the almighty god of the arabs , who controls good and evil " and the merciful christian god " who can forgive every sin . "
" i 'm writing you to remind you of your promise . "
" jeanne ... " must never find out . "
" never . "
" farewell .
" your son , aissa . "
what happened ?
why did he reject me ?
hey arab !
stay where you are !
don 't move , arab !
- yes ?
- open up !
i didn 't know where else to go .
come in .
oh , it 's you .
where 's bahia ?
she went to oran with her father .
why didn 't you take her with you ?
i 'd have looked after her .
have you eaten ?
no .
i 'm not hungry .
i 'll go make your bed .
you can 't stay in algeria .
they 'll kill you .
you can spend the night here . tomorrow , i 'll put you on a boat to spain .
i paid half already .
give them the rest when you arrive .
this is a safe-conduct .
just in case .
and a pistol .
it could come in handy .
thank you .
- what a beautiful country .
- our country .
- what happened to us , odilon ?
- life .
do you remember menilmontant ?
uniting the east and the west ?
why did you forsake our ideals ?
they were utopian .
the arab kingdom is not utopian .
just the opposite . it 's realistic .
you 'll see it too one day .
why do you force your ideals on me ?
mine are as good as yours .
i want this land to become a part of france , of republican france . freedom , equality , fraternity .
freedom ? or the right for the strong to oppress the weak !
not necessarily .
republican education will turn these arabs into good french citizens .
it 'll take time , but i 'm optimistic .
they should become good algerian citizens , instead !
you 're bound to fail !
the future will decide .
- god will decide .
what happened to toussaint ?
i never saw him again .
i 'm told he went back to algeria .
how come ?
he followed his own path , alone , which doesn 't surprise me .
you never saw him again ?
wasn 't he a friend ?
you see , we never parted ways .
you know , we need utopians , dreamers .
the world couldn 't exist without them .
excuse me , i must go now .
it 's rather cold in here , wouldn 't you agree ?
it is .
after a while , the cold gets to you .
it 's just awful .

looks like somebody 's having a bad head day .
detective chance briggs , you old bucket of shrimps .
what 's my old partner doing here ?
the yoozh .
what 's with the water coming out of the face ?
he was my ex-boyfriend .
i loved his head . the victim had his head ripped clean off .
look familiar to you , maestro ?
looks an awful lot like that rash of murders 15 years ago .
those were all boyfriends of yours , too , right , cat ?
it 's almost enough to make a girl stop dating .
or only date guys you want to see dead .
can you find the person who did this ?
not on my own . i 'm gonna need some help from my old partner .
i haven 't been a cop for a long time .
it 's in your blood , your glands .
i could smell it in you on our first day working together .
_
detective briggs ?
i 'm your new partner , owen maestro .
ugh !
rookie move , maestro . never let your guard down like that .
but section 19 / a of the rule book says --
the rule book 's never been out on the streets .
sometimes , you got to bend the rules .
sucker punch !
sucker punch ! but that 's not what we learned at the academy .
the academy doesn 't know crap .
just ask the rule book . release .
so , what 's our assignment ?
the childrens hospital murders .
they just found a fourth victim decapitated like the others .
four decapitations , huh ?
these victims sound like the beatles of decapitations .
the fab four -- without heads .
i mean i 've heard of " help , " but this is ridiculous .
mop tops ? how about no tops ?
you know that song " come together " ?
well , this is like " come apart . "
you know .
" i want to hold my head . "
... " on , so it doesn 't get cut off . "
this band is not gonna have the talking heads for an opening act .
- let 's go .
which one of you is in charge ?
well , that couldn 't be me .
the only thing i 'm in charge of is this .
hey , uh , boss !
- these guys want to talk to you .
- okay . okay , i 'll talk to you later .
hi . i 'm brad lendricks .
i 'm the head paramedic .
what do you want ?
it 's about the recent killings at the hospital .
you mean the ones due to the serial killer or medical negligence ?
let 's save the snaps for " yo mtv snaps . "
word is the paramedics are the eyes and ears of the hospital .
brad can 't help you .
no , he 's always been mysteriously missing whenever a murder happened .
if you 'll excuse me , i have to go stand over there .
if you ask me , brad 's glad all those guys got offed .
see , he 's been in love with cat for years , but she refuses to go out with him .
and now he 's got a clear playing field .
a clearly stated motive .
still , we need some solid evidence .
all we have on the guy is what this bald asshole told us .
no offense -- i 'm sure you have some really great qualities , too .
i 'm just going off of first impressions .
you know , i 've always wanted to be a doctor .
ever since i graduated medical school .
so , did you ever become a doctor ?
yeah . i 've been a doctor for 15 years .
oh , yeah , right .
that is not good enough , okay ?
i want these tires to be white !
there 's more urine where this came from .
there 's that paramedic .
how do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago ?
chet mandvanteussen ?
just do it better next time .
we want to talk to you about the murder of cat 's most recent boyfriend .
you 've done pretty well for yourself , haven 't you , mandvanteussen ?
you 're head paramedic now , your own ambulance , your own assistant .
maybe . doesn 't mean i killed cat 's boyfriend .
it could have been anybody .
what about former secretary of state condoleezza rice ?
okay . not her .
one down .
about 6 billion to go .
we need the personnel records on everyone who 's worked here in the past 15 years .
i 'm sorry .
any files over 14 years old are converted into microfilm and then shipped to our storage facility in the deep south where they are then destroyed .
i wish i could be more helpful .
_
turn up anything ?
and lots of it .
just like we found at each of the other murder scenes .
yeah , and according to the lab , all the semen samples came from the same person , probably male .
i would say definitely male .
my guess is lendricks , but we can 't know without a sample of his semen .
detective ?
i 'm on it .
i like your haircut .
thank you .
got it .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
this is a cutting-edge device used to identify dna .
welcome to the future , my friend .
and now i 'll just call the lab .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
it 's the new motorola clamshell , briggs .
you never seen a cellphone ?
sure , but if i need to call someone , i 'll use a pay phone .
this is more than just a phone , partner .
look -- time and date .
good god .
i guess it is a time and date machine .
we got a match .
- chet , are you cleaning that gurney ?
- yes , sir ! hold it right there .
you 're under arrest for the murder of --
whoa ! i want to talk to a lawyer !
the only lawyer you 'll be talking to is one appointed to you by the court .
veteran move , maestro .
wrong seat .
could you get in the back , please ?
oh . there we go .
watch your head .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , girls .
zoe , thank you so much for your note .
that was so sweet .
lendricks .
last time we saw you , you were a man .
what ?
shut up !
i made a deal with the district attorney to be sent to the women 's prison --
better food , less athlete 's foot , and the sex is amazing .
what ? anything goes !
we think your old assistant chet may be copycatting you .
i didn 't do it in the first place .
wait . what ?
your semen was found at every crime scene .
semen , semen , semen , semen !
i used to masturbate in the closets at work .
is that a crime ?
in iraq , yes , and also here .
okay , all i ask is that when you find this guy , you clear my name .
except for the masturbating part .
i did do that , and i want that credit .
look at us , huh ?
working a case , just like the first day we met .
actually ... it 's time i told you about the real first day we met .
what 's happening ?
the year was 1992 .
during my junior year at oberlin , i took a part-time job at a veterinary hospital -- the night shift .
it was just me and the animals .
this is where he figures out who the murderer is .
as the months progressed , i had to figure out a way to pass the time ...
you stupid ape .
you missed a straight diagonal move .
... but i was bored , so , of course , i started dressing up this one baboon in human clothes .
just one more thing .
my name is chance briggs .
- very good .
- briggs . i own you .
own .
me owen .
sure .
you owen .
i 'm gonna call you owen .
owen ! that 's right .
- owen .
- you owen !
- me owen !
- you owen .
you were a monkey .
that explains so much .
like how i have no human relatives .
and how i always think of you as a god .
yep . monkeys are capable of many things .
too bad they aren 't better at solving crimes .
wait a minute .
i think i just figured it out .
i think i just solved both cases .
if you 're right , then i 'll take back what i said about monkeys not being good at solving crimes .
my partner needs to ask you some questions , chief .
if you don 't cooperate with us , ma 'am , we 're gonna have to take you down to the station for questioning .
don 't you get it , briggs ?
that 's not chief .
that 's not chief one bit .
that 's a baboon .
i won 10 large at the track , monkey .
be back tomorrow before post time .
- crap .
- wait a minute .
what 's this money doing at your desk ?
okay , you got me .
i dress up this baboon to fill in for me when i go to the track .
it 's an old chief surgeon 's trick .
i 've been doing it for 15 years .
your days of monkeying around are over .
yeah . it 's gonna be a real hard day 's night for you .
let it be .
a baboon is so strong , they could tear a man 's head clean off his body .
which is exactly what he 's been doing ... for 15 years .
isn 't that right , fella ?
and there 's your confession .
you 're in big trouble .
why ?
is replacing yourself at work with a monkey a crime ?
in iraq , yes .
but not here , so ...
actually , i guess you 're not in trouble .
great .
thanks , guys .
how did you figure it out ?
sherlock holmes once said ,
" when you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , is most likely a monkey . "
it takes a baboon to know a baboon .
sure does , partner . it sure does .
- owen , no .
it 's just a siren ! - aah ! - aah !
aah ! - really ?
! really ? !
- heel ! - aah ! aah !
- release ! release , buddy !
no , bad owen !

we got back late from the cottage .
um , we were supposed to study before rounds .
i know , but it was so hard to leave .
it was beautiful there .
except for the mosquitoes .
they were huge !
you should have seen the size of them .
they were like vampire bats .
and for whatever reason , they were only biting me .
you should see my back .
i 'm covered in bites .
i can 't stop scratching .
except some of them , i can 't really reach ' cause they 're in the middle of my back .
would you mind rubbing this bite stuff on me ?
oh !
who are you ? !
- i 'm a doctor .
- so am i !
good !
so why are we yelling ? !
i ...
ooh !
i want to be with her .
i 'm ...
i 'm sorry , that 's - that 's not possible .
she 's gone .
i know .
[ inhales sharply but i ...
i should be with her .
it 's ... it 's not fair that she 's alone .
right .
well , i 'm ...
i 'm gonna make sure you have a chance to say a proper goodbye , all right ?
um ...
i just need you to lift up your arm for me .
kurt , did you know that illyana had agreed to be an organ donor ?
yeah , of course .
we signed our cards together .
okay , well , of course , we 're gonna need a final consent if there are any family members .
there aren 't .
i 'm her only family .
well , illyana is gonna be able to help more people today than she ever could have imagined .
what do you mean ?
um ...
illyana is a match for a patient waiting for a kidney transplant .
that patient 's fiance wanted to donate his , but they weren 't a match .
but illyana is ?
yeah , it 's ... it 's actually ...
it 's even better than that .
see , the , um ...
the patient 's fiance has agreed to ... to give his kidney to someone else , and that patient 's donor partner has also consented .
we call all of this a domino transplant .
basically ...
four people are gonna have a second shot at life today , and three people are willing to put their lives on the line ... all because of illyana .
seriously , are you ...
are you hearing this ?
uh ...
it 's nothing .
um ...
okay , i 'm ...

shahir , she 's the perfect donor for terry brown .
you 're talking about the domino transplant ?
when 's the last time you saved four lives in a single day ?
we 'll need to organize our surgeries so the wait time for each recipient is as soon as possible .
they 'll need to be off of dialysis and ready to go as soon as their organs arrive .
we 'll also need a team to confirm that the recipients are prepped and in the o.r. by the time their kidneys arrive .
this is keith .
he 's our last recipient .
but he 's in severe renal failure and can 't travel to hope zion , so we will coordinate with st. donald 's to deliver his kidney .
this is all hands on deck .
i 'm gonna bring in the junior residents .
williams and mirani will keep things moving .
we 'll get sekara to be our gopher for the day .
the most important thing to remember is , we 've got one shot at this .
seven surgeries .
four harvest and three transplants in the next few hours before the final kidney goes to st. donald 's children 's hospital .
if something goes wrong with one ...
and the dominoes stop falling , so no screw-ups .
everyone , dr. jeremy bishop , our newest gen-surg on staff .
- i 'm alex .
- reid .
yeah .
you need no introduction .
charlie 's told me a lot about you .
thank you for diving in .

check the board , make sure you know where ...
how are the bug bites ?
we 'll be the first in the city to lead a multi-hospital domino transplant .
doogie .
how 's it going ?
okay , maggie , take dev and start the first harvest .
cassie and asha , i 'll need you to coordinate .
i 'll be handling all of the transplants .

you know , we 're cancer patients , not historians .
josh lewis , professor of 18th-century poetry .
or , well , i was until ...
has the , uh , has the nurse been in yet ?
no .
it 's hurry up and wait .
well , they have to test our blood first , so ...
yeah , make sure it 's okay to poison it .
yeah , the irony 's not lost on me .
but , then , nothing about this place makes any sense .
i mean ...
i mean , i know ...
let 's get all the sick people , we 'll put them in one place , and then have them treated by some semi-socialized beaker head with a god complex .

let 's get you started on the docetaxel .
yum , yum .
i 'm a doctor , too .
doctor of old poems .
you writing a book ?
trying to .
thought i might have at least one great novel in me .
although , now it turns out it might have to be a novella .
or it might just be , you know , a professional hazard .
teaching all that great literature , making me think i can do it , too .
speaking of professional hazards ...
doctor becomes a patient , huh ?
mm .
all done .
you 're next up , josh .
you guys need anything , i 'm your gal today .
thank you , dawson .
you know , it must be hard , knowing all the facts , to still believe you can actually beat this .
i 'm putting both of you under at the same time .
no food , no drinks , so finish up your beers , boys .
you ready to get off dialysis ?
hell yeah , he 's ready .
we got a wedding to plan .
so , we got transport on standby to take your kidney to st. donald 's .
dr. reid will be with you shortly .
you ready , erin ?
my twins turn 7 next week .
i 've been on dialysis since they were 4 years old .
so yeah .
i 'm ready .
it 's been a long road .
thank you .
we 're just waiting for your donor .
larry 's not big on cellphones .
all he 's got is this old flip , and the battery 's always dead .
well , time is of the essence , emma .
he can 't just disappear like this .
he 'll be here , honey .
larry doesn 't have time for a lot of people , but his big sister 's one of them .
nobody can help an old guy with a chair , huh ?
- larry !
- larry .
must 've passed a dozen orderlies schlepping this damn thing .
you 'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before liz taylor here .
got your chair .
larry ...
they found a donor .
what ?
i 'm getting my kidney .
the right donor came in to trigger the domino chain .
it is our lucky break .
well , i ...
i wasn 't expecting this today .
well , yes , i know .
this is all coming very fast .
but we need to move now .
we 'll get you into surgery shortly .
but , uh ...
i was just reading this thing online .
a guy gave his kidney , and ... and , um ...
he developed an unexplainable appetite for pumpkin pie .
wouldn 't eat anything else ...
just pumpkin pie , pumpkin pie , day after day .
i hate pumpkin pie .
are you seriously talking about pie right now ?
i ...
i just need time to process this , emma .
dr. reid , maggie sent me down .
something wrong , dr. reid ?
it 's fine .
just try to relax .
excuse me .
what 's going on ?
it 's the cadaveric donor .
we lost the right kidney .
how bad is it , maggie ?
right kidney 's lost blood supply .
it 's a goner .
left one is hypoplastic .
so , we are looking at a small kidney with a crazy arterial network .
might be too many to anastomose .
well , terry 's prepped .
they haven 't opened him up yet .
what do you want to do ?
i promised four patients they were getting off dialysis today .
that is still the plan .
okay , we will cut a piece of her aorta , use it to make an arterial cuff around the renal arteries , and then we 'll have one in anastomosis instead of three .
okay .
go get ready for the next harvest , please .
mm-hmm .
somebody page dr. bishop .
all right , ureter is free .
just the artery cuff to go .
so , the weather 's great in l.a. why 'd you come back ?
i tried an emergency spinal corpectomy on a 15-year-old car crash victim .
did they die ?
no .
no , i saved her life .
and i still got sued anyway .
wow .
that is rough .
yeah .
they had more lawyers on staff than doctors .
suction .
i wasn 't getting any better ...
just safer .
from everything i 've heard about you , caution isn 't really your thing .
the way you 're working those scissors , i 'd say it 's not yours , either .
okay .
here we go .
got it .
start perfusion and get it ready for transplant .
kristine .
oh , hey .
have you , um , seen a , uh ...
uh , yeah .
i 've seen her .
i 've been hearing her all day , too .
yeah .
i 've been trying to talk to her .
no , she doesn 't want to talk .
i don 't think she wants any help at all .
okay , well , what does she want ?
uh , well , what do you know about her ?
uh ...
she 's a trapeze artist .
her and her partner took a bad fall .
he managed to pull through , but she 's having her ... harvested as we speak .
ohhh .
that 's so sad .
i-i think i actually know the song .
" my pigeon home , " it 's called .
it 's a lullaby .
- lullaby ?
- mm .
so she 's trying to put us to sleep .
not working .
well , it 's a song about reuniting .
i think she might be trying to convince someone to join her .
when we met , i was the water boy for my high school basketball team , and i got stuffed in a locker after practice .
did dan save you ?
no .
i was in the one next to him .
sounds romantic .
oh , it was .
took three hours till the janitor found us .
what were you screaming , again ?
" my legs ...
i can 't feel my legs . "
sounds hilarious .
we knew if we could make it through high school together , we could make it through anything .
so far , we have .
time to go in .
take good care of him .
don 't tell me you don 't know the story of abelard and heloise .
no , but i have a funny feeling you 're about to tell me .
12th century , paris .
heloise is this whip-smart student who wants the answer to human existence .
well , that was her first mistake .
so she goes to study with pierre abelard , who 's the greatest scholar in france at the time ...
about 20 years her senior .
nothing wrong with that .
well , it was for her uncle fulbert .
he found out about their affair , beat the living crap out of abelard .
the lovers were banished to live apart forever .
they corresponded by love letters for the rest of their lives .
so ?
what do you think ?
do you ever stop talking ?
um ...
when i 'm sleeping , i guess .
oh !
well , then , night-night , professor .
oh , i 'm sorry .
you want one ?
not unless there 's weed in them .
no way .
which part of " i 'm a poetry professor "
didn 't you understand ?
well , then , what the heloise are you waiting for ?
pass me a pot cookie .
mmm !
mm-hmm .
dr. reid .
pali .
what 's up ?
i wanted to give this to her .
or to him ...
whoever 's donating to erin .
the donors are all anonymous .
i can 't give you a name .
i-i know , but the girls made me promise that i would give it to the person that helped their mommy get better .
right .
i will see what i can do .
thank you .
you don 't know what it 's like sitting there helpless while your best friend just gets sicker and sicker .
of course you know what it 's like .
you 're a doctor .
i ...
so you get why it 's so important to me that that gets to erin 's donor ?
uh , yeah , just ...
i 'm sorry .
excuse me .
is everything okay ?
larry ?
oh !
where are you going ?
home .
what ?
why ?
i 'm not doing it .
i thought i was ready , but i 'm not .
i only came in today to drop off my sister 's chair .
okay , i know that all of this has been sprung on you , and you 're probably incredibly overwhelmed , but ...
all due respect , you have no idea what i 'm going through .
i made a decision .
i 'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone .
don 't let him leave the building .
- berger is still in the building .
- what ?
that was zach .
he spotted him pacing by the coffee kiosk .
which means he 's waffling .
yes , which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his latte to get him back on board .
all right .
i got this .
hey , larry .
hi .
how do you know my name ?
my name 's dr. bishop .
it 's my first day here .
congratulations .
i 'm leaving .
hey , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
just ...
just hear me out ...
just for a second .
i just moved back here from l.a .
i was there training under this dr. pearlman .
amazing surgeon .
genius .
also ... a very pious man .
and he taught me a lot of things .
including this hebrew phrase ... " tikkun olam . "
it 's from the talmud .
it means " repairing the world . "
says all of humanity has a shared responsibility to heal and transform the world .
why are you telling me this ?
dr. pearlman , he 'd remind us about " tikkun olam "
before every surgery we did .
larry , i think you have a chance to heal the world today in the simplest , most pure kind of way .
and i know you 're scared .
i get that .
i really do .
i swear .
but i think it 's something worth considering .
and i don 't think you 'd still be here if you didn 't think so , too .
my mind 's made up .
the answer 's no .
i 'm sorry .
no .
so , there 's these , um ...
hm ?
um , you know ...
you know ...
double doors ... the kind that open in the center , and , um ...
but one of the hinges was broken , so ... they ...
they kept that locked .
but he didn 't know that .
so , anyway , you know , he 's finally ready , and he 's got , you know , his tray of cheese , you know , it 's just right .
and he 's carrying it like it 's , you know , the most precious thing in the entire world .
and then bam !
his nose goes into the glass , tray goes everywhere .
there 's , like , honey all over his beard .
oh !
oh .
i 've come unstuck .
oh !
whoopsie .
hang on .
oh !
- what the ...
- here .
let me .
here .
should you be doing this ?
why not ?
because i 'm a ...
what 'd you say ?
a beaker head with a god complex ?
no .
'cause you 're higher than a lab monkey .
what is going on here ?
um ...
relax .
josh just popped his i.v .
i got it back in .
no , you can 't do that .
i 'm sorry , but this isn 't your charge , dr. kinney .
the hell it isn 't .
i 'm a surgeon .
not in here , you 're not .
then what am i ?
i 'm sorry ?
if i 'm not a surgeon , well , what am i ?
a dead duck .
that 's ...
that 's what he said .
i didn 't ...
that 's what you implied .
in here , you 're just my patient .
right .
so , what are my chances of surviving this ?
dr. kinney .
no , seriously .
i have a reoccurrence of stage 3 metastatic breast cancer , so what are the odds i 'll be here ...
by christmas ?
that 's not fair .
you stay out of this .
as your patient , dawson , i am asking .
i do ...
i ...
i 'm not ...
i don 't feel comfortable answering that .
no .
of course you don 't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm ...
i didn 't mean to be ...
you 're all good now , josh .
thank you .
okay , then .
um ...
i 'll be back in a bit to check on you both .
great .
where did you two meet ?
uh ...
at auditions for cirque .
two total misfits .
her parents , russian immigrants , kicked her out of the house when she was 14 .
mine ... hardly even noticed i was gone .
she understood me .
yeah , i guess when you meet someone like that ... who gets you , quirks and all ... nothing else really matters , right ?
dr. harris ?
time of death ... 3 : 13 p.m .
kurt ?
let 's get him back to his room .
okay .
i don 't believe it .
it 's my fault .
i pushed him too hard .
it 's no one 's fault .
he 's never been very good with surprises .
when we were kids , i used to jump out behind corners , and one time ...
she popped out , and i hit her square in the mouth .
15 stitches .
i told you he 'd come ' round .
you were right .
i am scared .
i 've been scared my whole life .
you 've always been this golden child ...
good grades ...
good friends .
we 'll give you two some privacy .
i 've always been this neurotic mess .
that 's not true .
it is .
everyone thought it was a joke when i said i would donate .
but you stood up for me .
we 're in a good place , emma .
i don 't want it to stop .
it won 't .
you 're my brother .
that is never gonna change .
ohhh , boy .
uh , hey , alex , i need you to come take a look at this .
what do we have ?
a frozen kidney .
larry put us behind schedule .
it must have been too close to the ice for too long .
even if we thaw that , we 've got little chance of getting it to perfuse .
we 've come too far to turn back now .
so , what do you want to do ?
get me 10 bags of warm saline .
and a blowtorch .
kidding !
hold the blowtorch .
all right , then .
that freezing didn 't do us any favors , but the warm saline flush ... it looked good .
you think it 'll live ?
it has to .
okay .
suturing the renal vein .
okay .
renal vein and artery are anastomose .
okay .
moment of truth .
let 's release those clamps and pray that it takes .
exactly .
oh , come on .
come on .
let 's go .
okay .
we got good perfusion .
yes !
yoooo !
hey , do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis ?
i have to go check in on larry , make sure he 's all right .
you got it .
thanks , bishop .
how did it go ?
this is odd .
what ?
he should be waking up now .
heart rate 's skyrocketing .
alex ?
he could be having a stroke .
page shahir .
let 's get him up to imaging ... now .
okay .
good catch , alex .
it was a stroke .
he 's coning .
the swelling from the epidural bleed is pressing on his brain stem .
there .
that should relieve the pressure .
alex , it 's okay .
you can go .
i 've done plenty of these .
turn up the music , please .
thank you .
my daughter , molly , is , um ...
studying psychology at queens .
she wants to be a couples counselor , of all things .
i haven 't told her yet ...
that it 's back .
toughest thing in the world ...
watching your kid trying to be brave ...
no matter how old they are .
especially when you know the real truth .
yeah , i 'd like to apologize for that .
no .
why ?
it 's the truth .
okay .
then i say we - we double down on this ... " stranger on a train " vibe we got going here .
let 's tell each other one thing that we 've never told another living soul .
okay .
yeah ?
who goes first ?
i don 't know .
you want to rock , paper , scissors ?
oh , careful .
you 're gonna pull out your i.v. again .
i 'll go .
i don 't want to do this again .
i don 't want to sit here , getting sicker and sicker .
i want to ...
i want to get on a plane .
i want to fly away .
your turn .
well , i want to come with you .
if looks could kill , i 'd be the ghost right now .
well , look at it this way .
what would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep alex away from you ?
so , how do we help her if she won 't talk to us ?
i don 't know .
you know , maybe he doesn 't see her , maybe he doesn 't hear her , but if he feels her , if he senses that she 's here ...
then what ?
he won 't move on , either ?
he won 't get better ?
that 's a bit of a stretch , don 't you think ?
charlie .
i 'm just saying , it 's not very scientific .
no , look .
illyana , you need to talk to us .
he needs to be with me .
it was your time .
it 's not his .
you need to accept that .
he won 't make it without me .
he 's gonna have to try .
i won 't go without him .
i can 't .
something 's wrong .
illyana , what are you doing ?
i love him too much .
his heart rate 's through the roof .
you need to go now !
i can 't .
i won 't .
he 's got a petechial rash .
we need to get him to radiology right now .
could be a fat embolus in his lungs .
bone marrow may have seeped out of the break and migrated .
- can you fix him ?
- i don 't know .
come on .
illyana !
stop !
call the code .
we need a crash cart .
look , charlie .
code blue , e.t. wing 203 .
code blue , e.t. wing 203 .
kurt never had a chance .
i 'm really not in the mood to see the bright side .
people who love each other that much belong together , even in death .
i 'm not buying that .
sorry .
i had a daughter .
maddie .
it was 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
not even happy hour .
this guy 's all over the road .
he 's coming right at us .
i tried to get out of the way , but there wasn 't enough time .
we didn 't ...
we didn 't have enough time .
my little girl .
kris .
i wanted to die ... so i could be with her .
i 'm sorry .
i had no idea .
when i woke up in the hospital ...
she was gone .
but there were all these other spirits that only i could see .
there 's still so much i 'm trying to figure out about this ...
this thing we have .
well , maybe we could help each other , you know ?
figure this thing out together .
i 'd like that , charlie .
last ones .
i 'm glad to see you .
yeah , model patients .
transplants went off without a hitch .
pali , your kidney is taking a little trip to close out the domino .
it 's going to somebody who desperately needs it .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
you were badass , alex .
yeah , she 's not wrong .
all right , girls .
on to recovery ice cream .
ahh !
so ?
so , he 's gonna make a full recovery .
thank god .
one more transport to go , alex , and you 've pulled it off .
not me ... all of us .
hey .
nice ride .
oh , yeah .
thanks .
how 'd it go ?
exhausting , but , um ... eventful .
alex .
i met a boy .
at chemo ?
yes .
and he 's a poet .
and he asked to come to paris with me because he wants to show me where abelard and heloise are buried .
dana .
and i said " yes . "
you just started chemo .
i know , but i 'm ...
i 'm thinking that i just have to fight this in a different way for a while .
i 'm sorry , but this is insane .
actually , i think this is the sanest thing i have done in a long time .
you 're flying off to paris with a poet that you met a few hours ago .
well , when you put it like that ...
instead of prolonging your life ...
alex .
i don 't want to prolong my life .
i want to live it .
hey .
how you feeling ?
like i just got run over .
you ?
same .
i wanted to , um ...
well ...
i , um ...
i wrote you something .
oh , it 's a ... - limerick , yeah . - yeah .
uh ...
it was the only rhyme scheme i could remember , and i 'm half-irish , so ...
" a terminal lass from kilbride was befuddled by fear and by pride . "
hm .
" till she heard a sweet man say he 'd come with her partway .
so she kissed him , she smiled , and she cried . "
thank you , doctor .
so ...
how does it end ?
the story ?
oh .
- heloise .
- right .
does she find the real meaning of life ?
oh , she does .
oh , yeah ?
the love she found with abelard ...
that was the meaning of human existence .
oh .
love .
hey . what 's going on ?
nothing .
you ready ?
look , i get it , greg is your jacob , but we all know you 're going to end up with edward .
because you 're bella .
what is that reference ?
it 's on the tip of my tongue .
it 's ...
twilight .
twilight , yes .
it 's only the greatest love story
- since shakespeare ... in love . - right .
yeah .
right , yeah , okay .
what are you talking about again ?
you spent thanksgiving with greg , and that was not part of our plan .
you need to be with josh .
if not for you , then for me .
- why ?
- i need this .
my marriage is like the walking dead , okay ?
we are all just trying to get out alive .
you and josh , your love story ... it gives me hope .
what love story ?

we 're gonna go to a movie as friends .
it 's like he 's a stalker .
okay ?
no one likes a stalker .
the eagle and the bitch have landed .
really ?
let me see .
let me see . let me see .
um , joshy , do you need , um , glasses ?
because the door is right over there .
oh . my bad , babe .
okay , well ... i hope they like the rice cooker i got them .
everyone likes rice , right ?
it 's a very versatile grain .
what ?
are you crazy ?
you don 't want them snuggling up over the one dish that connects their cultures .
i 'm gonna go give them this gift . okay .
- i 'll be right back , okay ?
- forget the gift .
forget about the gift .
i am just trying to snap you back into reality , because now that josh and valencia are living together , you are not gonna have any more alone time with him .
well , you know what ?
i just want him to be happy .
oh , my gosh , joshy , i 'm so glad we finally moved in together .
it 's the beginning of our happily ever after .
yes , it 's cool .
plus , we 'll be close to ...
marriage ?
kids ?
i was going to say taco bell .
there 's only one thing missing .
the salsa ?
you just ask for it .
no , furniture , joshy .
i mean , we don 't even have a dining room table .
but we 'll get one .
let 's burn sage .
shoot , i forgot to get that .
joshy , i needed that sage to cleanse the house of evil spirits .
ghosts are obsessed with me .
i 'll get it right now .
i love you .
ugh , i hate her .
she 's worse than all the kardashians combined .
except for caitlyn , who is a national hero .
i 'm just gonna call josh and see if it 's cool that i come over .
do you need me to call valencia from a burner phone and tell her there 's been a murder at the yoga studio so you and josh can have more alone time ?
you came up with that way too quickly .
oh , he pressed " ignore " "
oh ... oh ... that doesn 't feel good .
it 's fine , it 's fine .
he 's busy .
i get it , i 'm busy , too !
i won 't even think about it .
i don 't want to feel this way .
i reject this feeling .
i respectfully decline this feeling .
hey , here she is !
here 's my mvp .
you ready to kick butt at that meeting ?
calvin young is the most important potential client we have ever had .
i 'm joking .
i mean , he is .
i mean , landing him would make us west covina 's premiere law firm .
but , by the time you knock his socks off today , wine and dine him over the weekend and then do your presentation on monday , he will be ... putty in our hands .
- oh . - are you okay ?
i mean , you look a little peaked .
never felt better . uh-huh .
i definitely won 't press ignore ... on this case .
what ?
" mr. young , i know that you have your choice of law firms
" to represent you in this matter
" of josh moving into a new apartment with his hot girlfriend ... " no !
i typed that ?
_
well , then , why do i have you in the office ?
huh ? gotcha there , bottle .
and here 's a health messages from tv 's favorite doctor .
do you know the signs and symptoms of the dreaded panic attack ?
well , if you don 't , you need to join me for my week long marathon where i 'm gonna teach you how to identify the symptoms , such as shortness of breath ... heart palpitations , the urge to self-medicate with drugs and booze .
he 's here !
whole firm is counting on you .
okay , i 'm coming .
scott , i am asking you to drive carpool for one day .
i do it every day .
oh ... fine .
fine , okay , whatever , i gotta go .
it 's nice to ... feel appreciated .
your perfume is delightful .
thank you .
i rubbed a magazine on myself this morning .
well , it smells like a cherub dancing in the morning dew .
i 'm calvin young .
paula proctor .
welcome to whitefeather .
are we , by chance , going to the same meeting ?
follow me .
calvin young .
nice to meet you .
hi , karen , the case assistant .
please excuse my handshake .
i have naturally damp hands .
it 's a medical condition .
i am in some studies .
shall we be seated ?
you okay ?
- may i get you some coffee , mr. young ? - yes .
uh , french press , if you have it .
french press .
mr. young , we are so excited to have this opportunity to bring you into the whitefeather family .
'cause that 's what we are .
a family that can help you acquire the industrial acreage you 're looking for .
well , i am pleased to be here , darryl .
well , we are determined to show you everything that we 're capable of .
and to do that ... i can think of no one else but our closer .
um , why don 't you take it away , there , rebecca ?
would you please take it away ?
welcome , calvin .
oh , my god , your teeth are blue .
have you been drinking the water from the toilet ?
oh , crap .
it 's ink .
must 've been from my pen cup .
welcome ... to joshfeather .
white ... feather .
oh , god .
what happened to you in there ?
that 's not the rebecca i know .
i mean , something is wrong .
karen said that she smells vodka on you .
well , that 's ridiculous .
vodka doesn 't smell .
listen , darryl , i know i didn 't bring my " a " game ...
i think you need to go home .
wait , are you taking me off the case ?
please don 't take me off the case , because if you take me off the case , that means i 'm not working and if i 'm not working , that means i have to think thoughts .
okay , you 're not off the case .
but go home and work on the presentation .
and then , when you come back on monday , i want you to be the happy rebecca that we all know and love .
such a good tip .
so helpful .
" be happy . "
hi , paula .
hey , are you okay ?
i got back with calvin 's fancy coffee and darryl said you weren 't feeling well and you went home .
yeah . yeah , my blood sugar was a little low , so i decided to just come home and really focus on the presentation all weekend .
hey , are you sure you 're cool to do the calvin dinner without me ?
well , i 'll do my best .
okay . uh , i gotta hop off .
i 'm really working hard here .
bye !
it 's important to deal with one 's feelings head-on , because repressed feelings lead to depression .
what do you know ?
repression equals depression .
that is ...
_
i 'm tired , too .
_
i 'm depressed , too .
man ... the french really know how to make depression look sexy .

there is nothing sexy about depression , rebecca .
listen , you better get your act together , young lady , or you 're gonna run this new life off in the ditch .
how did you get in here ?
well , your depressed mind invited me in .
and by the way , this place is a dump .
you ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something , anything ?
maybe a mural ?
i don 't know about this .
are you sure this is the dining table she wants ?
i don 't know .
- i want to surprise her .
- surprise her ?
with furniture ?
she 's very picky , dude .
yeah , yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage .
you bought the kind you put in food , not the kind you scare ghosts away with .
valencia 's intense , bro .
as sexy as she is , she 's intense .
she has final approval over all your clothing .
yeah , you know ... yes .
i really miss your cargo 's .
we all do .
guys , i 'm committed to this relationship .
i want to contribute .
you know ? she 's done everything .
she picked out the apartment , she booked the moving trucks .
we 're supposed to be a team and i want to do something for her .
so we gonna do this or what ?
yes . yes , we are going to do this .
guys , we can bang this out .
according to this , it is a very simple - 72-step process . - 72-step process .
oh , hell no .
okay . we 're not doing that .
we lost hector .
what are you looking for ?
oh , my god , you 're still here .
tell it to me straight .
am i schizophrenic ?
i 'm not really here .
i 'm just in your imagination .
i mean , let 's face it :
you do have a very active imagination .
one minute , you 're walking down the street , the next minute , you 're in a big musical .
although , i gotta say ,
i did love the pretzel .
you did a good job on that one .
aw , it 's a shoelace tip .
ugh , that 's gross .
oh , my god , you 're looking for prescription meds in a drawer ?
so ?
listen , when i moved here , i thought i was okay , so i dumped them all my meds and now , you know , i realize that i 'm not okay .
i mean , look at me , i 'm falling apart here .
this is really bad .
so if i can just get my old prescription meds back , i 'll be okay .
uh , here 's a thought .
anxiety , depression ... how about you see a doctor first ?
i 'll go do that .
ten steps ahead of you .
thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice ,
dr. akopian .
what can i help you with ?
i 'm not myself right now .
we 're always ourselves , rebecca .
right . yeah .
no , so i don 't feel like myself .
this isn 't usually how i am .
like , i 'm normally very organized and focused .
sounds like you 're feeling out of control .
let 's delve into your childhood .
oh , i was afraid you 'd say that .
okay , so , i 've been through the therapy wringer ,
i 've rehashed my childhood a ton .
and i don 't really want to do it again .
like , for me and for you , frankly , i don 't want to put that on you .
so here 's what i need .
i need these .
those are the meds i was on in new york .
oh , my god .
how did your body react to all this medication ?
you must not have been able to feel a thing .
exactly .
numb as they come .
so ... scribble scribble on your pizzle pad .
rebecca , your doctor in new york is a quack .
he gave you a band-aid , not a cure .
my method would be to do some digging and figure out what 's really going on inside your mind .
and then we can discuss the appropriate medications .
so that 's great , but i need to be better by monday .
it 's a work thing , so ... we doing this ?
no , we 're not .
okay , well , you know what ?
you 'll be hearing from me on yelp .
um , where is your rest room ?
say , what time is your husband joining us ?
he bailed at the last minute .
he has rehearsal for his singing group .
and that 's more important than this ?
i don 't mind .
i 'm fine .
he does what he wants to do , i don 't care .
i do what i want to do , he doesn 't care .
it 's basically the storybook romance i dreamed of as a little girl .
aw , you see ? you guys get each other .
that 's so cool .
how are my eyebrows ?
don 't care .
they can be wonky .
few people know this , but bald eagles aren 't bald at all .
you see , the name actually derives from a word meaning " white headed . "
and being a " white feather , " well , i 've always felt very connected to our national bird .
actually , it 's my spirit animal .
may i just say this is an adorable red ?
unconventionally alluring , with the soul of a poet .
thank you .
i got it at the gas station , but in the ten-dollar bin .
in the future , you really should try some of the arizona wines .
blend those with a smooth camembert ... mmm ! heaven .
oh , i am imagining that .
mmm ... camembert .
it 's fun to say .
oh , you know what ?
let 's play a game .
you tell me everything about you , - don 't skip a thing , go . - okay .
i was born in irvine , california .
um , my favorite color is green ...
- not you . - oh .
ladies first .
of course .
i 'm sorry .
you know what ? calvin , you 're the guest , so you should go first . go ahead .
okay , well , um , i was born in prescott , but i knew a small town wasn 't for me , so i moved to the big city .
- phoenix ?
- tucson .
right .
yeah , and i , uh , met my lovely wife .
ten years of bliss ... and then she died .
it was a , uh , short and tragic illness .
the last thing she said was ...
" calvin , " be happy .
" take life and ... and grab it . "
and you should .
you should take whatever you want .
just take and grab .
i 'm gonna roll .
okay , let 's see ... pink pill with the number 55 on it ...
yes !
add medication .
i 've always wanted to take this .
- wait a minute .
- what ?
do-do i really need to tell you don 't take a pill you found on the bathroom floor next to the toilet ?
here me out , dr. phil .
it improves focus and promotes goal-directed behavior .
that 's exactly the mojo that i need .
rebecca , i know what it says , and i know what you need .
you need to focus on this :
josh could find you if he wanted to .
you have made yourself really easy to find .
you have been rejected .
rejected .
he doesn 't want you .
that 's reality .
deal with it .
no . i 'm not gonna listen to you .
you talk silly .
oh , my god .
oh , what 's that , little pill ?
" eat me , rebecca " ?
well , i think i will .
pills don 't talk .
don 't take it .
she took it .
let 's get to work .
all right , let 's see this presentation ...
what is karen doing ?
she put two spaces after a period .
what is this , 1997 ?
well , those have to go .
okay ! yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's kicking in right now .
and what are these , oxford commas ?
well , those have to go , too .
i just gotta edit this whole thing before i even start .
i would love to show you around tomorrow morning .
there 's , um , the chino hills state park , the azusa fish canyon falls .
may i be so bold as to inquire your availability and whereabouts tomorrow afternoon ?
uh , what ?
do you like jazz ?
hot jazz ?
is there any other kind ?
there 's a small place in south pasadena .
my friends who blow horn say it 's the best little jazz boite in town .
would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth licks ?
- i would . - mmm .
i would .
uh , but he 's , uh , busy .
he 's ... with rehearsal for his singing group .
he 's always busy .
and , you know , he 's not much of a licker .
what time do you want to pick me up ?
okay , so i 've been up all night and i hung the fish , painted the walls , put up the mural , cleaned out the fridge , redid the grout in the bathroom and for the finishing touch ...
you 're gonna be so excited !
christmas lights !
so , may i ask who 's crazy now ?
i never said you were crazy .
that 's a derogatory term and i don 't think it really applies to you .
where were you in my senior gender studies class ?
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , it 's time to get down to business .
but you know , before i get down to business , i 'm just gonna see what my friends are up to .
instagram , oh !
valencia posted a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom .
it says ♪ christened ...
how nice .
oh , nice to hear .
how 's that working for you ?
i don 't understand your question .
but you know what , i 'm starting to realize that maybe that pill was not what i needed .
oh , there 's a shocker .
just spare me .
spare me the wisecracks .
hey , it 's me .
you got any downers ?
is this enough of a downer for you ?
oh , my god .
i could just melt into the chair , like , like a butter lady .
that 's good .
no , that 's bad .
because i can 't get work done right now .
oh , i have an idea .
it 's the most fantastic-iest idea .
that 's not a real word .
seriously , seriously , seriously .
seriously , are you busy right now ?
honey , hi .
yeah , i-i 'll be home in , like , an hour , tops .
thanks , booboo .
valencia 's so mad at me .
we 've been here all night , and i haven 't even finished sorting the screws .
josh , there 's still time to bail .
on the table , i mean .
we were friends with you before we even met this table .
uh , the truth is none of us really even
like the current table .
i hate this table .
we don 't like , um , this table .
and you 're going to ruin your life if you stick with this table .
bros before ... tables .
i think it 's a nice thing you 're doing .
nicest thing i ever did for a girl was pull out .
hector ?
she has tandem parking , so after i 'm there for a while , i have to pull out .
which is such a pain , ' cause it feels so great just to leave it in there .
the worst is when it 's alternate side of the street parking , ' cause then i got to park it in back .
i don 't even get why there 's a spot back there .
it 's so tight .
feels more like an exit .
so then i 'm going front , back , front , back ... and it 's all dirty in the back , so when i move it to the front , then that gets all dirty .
i 'm just happy i have a spot at all .
'cause i used to have to pay .
well , that was edifying .
this burrito is a symphony .
dr. akopian 's gonna be so happy to see me .
when i pop up , she 's gonna be like ,
" whoa , you 're so chill !
i 'm gonna give you all the drugs " "
well , i want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around . hmm .
i bet her vacuum cleaner is filled with cool pharmaceuticals .
that 's such a good point !
i know .
i wonder what she has in there .
dr. akopian ?
dr. akopian , it 's me rebecca bunch !
i 'm really cool and chill now .
okay , not giving up , not giving up !
here , dr. akopian ?
oh , my god , it 's her prescription pad .
oh , i see it !
wait , she wouldn 't have left it by the window if she didn 't , like , want somebody to take it , right ?
yeah , it 's like a wizard test .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait , wait , what are you doing ?
you can 't fit through there .
yeah , yeah , i totally can .
because look at me ... look how tiny i am .
i 'm tiny ...
i 'm child-size .
i 'm a puppy .
i 'm a poodle . i 'm a shrimp .
yeah , i 'm going .
okay , yeah , all right .
oh , no , i think i 'm stuck .
oh , we forgot .
you 're small , but you got those british-nanny-sized boobs .
british nanny ...

are you ?
you know i could
- have you both arrested ?
- i didn 't do anything .
i 'm a student .
on what grounds ?
breaking and entering .
first of all ,
i only half-entered .
and second of all , as far as the breaking goes , you have no idea of my intent to steal your prescription pad .
i do now .
but since you were both stoned when you broke in , and not in your right mind ...
i 'm willing to offer you a deal , ms. bunch .
make an appointment and start to get help and i won 't press charges against either of you .
fine . yeah . you win .
let 's do this .
i will come in here ,
i will explore my feelings , do whatever you want .
now can i have the drugs ?
we 're done here .
i 'm done .
i give up .
i 'm gonna take a nap here for just a ... year .
what about your job thingy ?
oh , god , i hope darryl doesn 't fire me .
do me a favor ?
can you get my phone ?
i think it 's in your purse .
i know , i 'm just too tired .
can you get it ?
just put it in my hand ?
just place it inside my hand .
it 's coming .
place it inside .
- there .
- thank you .
hi , paula .
it 's me .
yeah , okay , listen , i got something to tell you .
i 'm not proud of it .
i cannot do the presentation with calvin on monday .
can you tell darryl for me ?
i 'm-i 'm actually with calvin , so i could just tell him .
what ?
we are at the hotel on east cameron and he just went out for ice , and i only have a second .
hotel ?
why are you at a ho ...
is that anita baker playing in the background ?
oh , oh , he 's coming back .
i gotta go .
i need a cab .
uber .
i need an uber .
oh , okay .
actually , no , forget the uber , it 's just around the corner .
come on !
i 've never been in a hotel room with a couch before .
uh , all the perks .
i can 't believe i 'm doing this .
it 's like a fantasy ... like strawberries and champagne is just gonna magically arrive at the door .
you didn 't !
don 't do it !
look at that .
it 's beautiful !
she 's gonna love it .
i-i feel so great about this .
she 's here . she 's here , guys .
mwah . okay . okay .
what ?
left .
what is it ?
is it a puppy ?
babe , what am i looking at ?
surprise !
it 's your new dining room table .
we stayed up all night making it for you .
- that you didn 't pick out .
- and i helped .
that 's so sweet .
so , do you like it ?
well ... it doesn 't match our other things .
it 's not exactly what i would 've picked out .
oh , well , i mean , if it 's ... not something you want , i mean , i guess i ...
you could take it apart and give it back ?
josh , you are so smart .
that 's a great idea .
give me a kiss .
i got to go back to class , you guys , but thank you so much .
oh , and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table .
yeah ? okay . bye .
she scares me so bad .
look , paula ,
i know your marriage is crap .
i get it .
and i get that you 're about to have the hottest sex of your life .
mmm .
right . so why are you stopping me ?
because it 's not real .
it 's a band-aid .
you know that .
remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality , right ?
and i didn 't get it ?
now i get it .
you 're doing the exact same thing .
you need to face your real problem , and your real problem is that your marriage is dead .
and you need to fully feel that , and you need to face it , because this is just a temporary fix .
it 's like a pill you found on the bathroom floor .
who would take a pill they found on the floor ?
look , look , i 've spent my whole life numbing myself , okay ?
i have spent my whole life escaping to far-off places , and it 's only recently , like , now , like , literally this second that i realize , like , i can 't do that !
i can 't do that .
i have to feel my feelings .
it 's okay to feel , paula .
it 's been five years since i made love without the tv on .
and ten years since somebody held my hand .
i-i miss my dead wife .
come here .
literally the most entertaining day of my life .
rebecca , making a speech like that in front of a potential client , that ... was brave .
also a bit foolish .
in most cases , clients would run in the opposite direction .
and i understand if this means you don 't want to work with me ...
look , let me finish .
you have the kind of no-nonsense honesty and raw emotional insight that i look for in a commercial real estate lawyer .
you are a wonderful woman ,
this weekend has been so special .
but marriage is a precious thing .
if i could hold my wife for one more second ...
oh . don 't make me cry again .
is this alpaca ?
it 's so soft .
my dead white wife loved alpaca .
what did you say to calvin ?
he was so impressed , he 's not even seeing other people .
i mean , how did you swing that ?
i just was honest about ... about all the great work you do ,
i just made him see what you wanted him to see , that we 're a group of kick-ass lawyers and we 're a family .
feel your feelings .
everyone should feel their feelings .
everyone should always feel their feelings .
well , i , for one , am feeling peeved , because this copier ...
cork it , karen !
but this copier ...
cork it !
rebecca , i 'm very glad you 're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself .
i am so grateful to be here , and i 'm excited to face my problems head-on .
i know it 's gonna be hard work , but it 's work that i am prepared ... it 's work ...
i 'm sorry .
i know i should just ... work ,
i should make sure this isn 't an emergency .
one second .
_
you know what , i 'm feeling better already , actually .
so i 'm-i 'm gonna go to this very important thing , but i want to let you know that this is not over .
i 'll see you next week .
what ?
get out of here !
a rice cooker ?
that 's perfect !
because valencia is mexican and i 'm filipino and rice is a staple in both of our ...
cultures . yeah . right .
uh , oh , sorry it took me forever to return your call from friday .
oh , my gosh , you ... you 're so busy .
don 't even think about it .
hey , can i ask you something ?
anything .
is this a nice table ?
it 's a perfect table .
that 's what i think .
thanks .
no problem .
uh , hey , um , do you want to come over sometime , just check out the new place ?
there 's not a lot of furniture , so there 's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our socks like in risky business .
oh , my god , that sounds amazing .
yes .
when ?
now ?
just , like , don 't tell valencia , ' cause she thinks it 's stupid .
well , valencia 's stupid .
sorry . i 'm sure she 's smart in her own way .
but anyway i have the perfect slippy-slidey socks .
number 31 .
oh , no . don 't you start with me .
just keep walking , old man .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
get out of my life .
oh , my god , uh , dr. phil .
i 'm a huge fan .
- how you doing ? - oh .
i 'm s ... oh , my gosh . i 'm sorry .
you 're actually dr. phil .
in the flesh .
it 's me .
even dr. phil has got to have his boba .
i 'm addicted to these things .
maybe you should , uh , get help for that .
you guys make a really cute couple .
oh . that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
no , no , no .
we 're just friends .
that 's so funny . he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny , but we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
yeah . g-good luck to you , buddy .

previously on " angie tribeca ... "
she 's awake .
- sergeant pepper ?
- angie .
- how long have i been out ?
- about nine months .
next you 're gonna tell me you 're seeing someone else .
scholls thinks i had the baby with some chick in canada .
yeah , don 't worry about it .
who 's his mother ?
is that really important , who 's his mother ?
do people really care who their mom is ?
i 'm ready to work , lieutenant .
you just got out of a coma .
hey , if tribeca says she 's ready , then she 's ready .
or do i have to show you my fist ?
i was wondering if i could see the visitors log from when i was in a coma .
has anyone here heard of the website " meetncheat.org " ?
their server 's been hacked .
this is all the stolen data from the meet 'n'cheat hack , names and addresses of all the members on the site .
they 're making it look like the lapd is publishing it .
my name is on the list .
mayor joe perry .
username ...
mayorjoeperry1 .
password ... " yesthatmayorjoeperry . "
i 'd like to introduce you to special agent diane duran .
so , mayhem global hires duran to hack meet 'n'cheat .
she draws us in .
then she hacks us from the inside .
but why ?
sergeant pepper . i know he 's still alive .
if you 're serious about finding pepper , he 'll meet you here .
i found out that the biggest criminal is not out on the streets .
he 's in the mayor 's office .
mayor perry ?
voter fraud , racketeering , money laundering , racketeering fraud , voter laundering .
the list goes on and on .
what about mayhem global ?
i am mayhem global .
there 's one number programmed into this phone .
when you 're ready to be part of the revolution , call it .
what 's the point of any of this ?
we have evidence , a confession , and the bad guy doesn 't spend one night in jail ?
- that 's the system , tribeca .
- the system sucks .
pieced it all together ?
almost .
now i 'm done .
currently on " angie tribeca ... "
you 're just perfect .
we 're gonna take such good care of you .
the freezematic 15,000 .
once this bad boy gets going , it 's gonna chill your milk , preserve your meat , call your sister , cure hepatitis .
just sign there .
yep . you 're looking at 28 cubic feet of self-regulated , vacuum-sealed cold .
that 's a separate produce crisper with an independent temperature control .
check out this freezer .
a dead body fro ...
that 's not supposed to be there .
but i just plugged it in , and it 's already ice-cold .
that 's pretty good .
tell us what happened .
well , growing up , i always thought i 'd be a pro football player , but i got a bum knee , so went into the family business ... real estate .
market takes a tumble , here i am .
how about what happened today .
got up about 4 : 30 , hit the snooze button ... just the one time ... got up , showered .
at work , sir .
what happened at work ?
let 's see .
i got to where i pick up the truck for deliveries .
finally .
i pull into the parking structure .
level " a " is full , level " b " is full .
level " c , " there was a compact spot , but i made it work .
what 's the name of the company you work for ?
golden gate fridge .
i am sick and tired of being sick and tired .
councilman dreyfuss is airing out all of mayor perry 's dirty laundry .
is this who you want leading your city for another four years ?
he actually has some good points .
it 's too bad the old guy doesn 't have a shot .
he 'd need a miracle to win .
and what are the odds of two miracles in one month ?
not likely .
so , where are we on the body in the fridge ?
we 're waiting on scholls for an i.d. and a cause of death .
i talked to someone at the refrigerator company .
they 're gonna send someone out to talk to us between the hours of 4 : 00 and 8 : 00 .
wow , that 's a huge window .
no appointments ?
you can get a specific time , but you have to wait like three weeks .
okay , so i 'll have tanner wait around for the fridge guy .
you guys check in with scholls and see if she has a name for us .
will do , lieutenant .
so , i tried calling you this weekend .
yeah , i dropped my phone in the toilet .
total write-off .
and then i immediately got this new one with a different number .
but we 're still on for bowling tonight .
yeah , actually , i can 't .
i dropped my bowling ball in the toilet .
total write-off .
and then i immediately got this one .
but the guy told me to wait a couple days until the marble settles .
ah , tribeca , geils .
come with me .
i want to show you something .
disgusting , isn 't it ?
- horrible .
- a cat did that .
anyway ...
how can i help you ?
we were wondering if you were able to i.d. the fridge corpse .
ah , the very cold case , yes .
come with me .
i want you to see something .
the deceased 's name is charles michael bucket , and his fingerprints match exactly those of a sailor who 's been missing for three days .
- navy ?
- worse . coast guard .
dr. scholls , can you show the detectives what you showed me ?
trying to make me jealous ?
- is that a whistle ?
- in his windpipe .
and something tells me he wasn 't born with it .
although he did die with it .
we think someone shoved a whistle down his throat after a struggle .
you can see the defensive wounds here and here .
why a whistle ?
someone trying to send a message ?
don 't blow whistles ?
someone 's telling him not to be a whistle-blower .
but what was he blowing the whistle on ?
no idea .
we examined every other orifice several times but found no evidence .
we 'll try and take out the whistle and see if we can pull some dna .
meanwhile , we 'll go pay a visit to the coast guard .
the commandant 's a very busy man , you know .
we appreciate you getting us in , petty officer snick .
chief petty officer snick , thank you very much .
and i thought you said you were coming at 2 : 00 .
isn 't it 2 : 00 ?
it 's 1 : 50 , which means i only got a 20-minute lunch break , but whatever .
it 's fine . i 'll have a candy bar or something .
sorry , petty officer .
we didn 't think it was a big deal .
detectives , commandant don van zandt .
come in , detectives .
that 'll be all , snick .
you 're welcome .
first of all , i 'd like to thank you for finding seaman bucket .
we are a brotherhood , and when one of our brothers go missing , it hurts the whole coast guard family .
if there 's anything that i could do to assist in your investigation , don 't be afraid to ask .
well , for starters ...
i 'm afraid that 's all the time that i 've got today .
cpo snick will see you out .
we were really hoping to ask you some questions ,
commandant don van zandt .
i know you were , detective . i know you were .
you listen here , popeye .
this is a murder investigation , and we 're the murder police .
so start talking .
i think you 're outside of your jurisdiction , detective .
this is an internal matter for the coast guard , thus to be handled internally by the coast guard with no outside help .
all due respect , commandant , this base is in l.a. county , so when somebody 's killed in l.a. , it is very much in our jurisdiction .
now , we 'd like to interview his bunk mates . we want to talk to the last person who saw him alive , and we want to know why he ended up dead in a refrigerator .
i don 't know how he disappeared or why he ended up in that refrigerator or how he got that whistle down his throat , but if our investigation turns up anything of interest , i 'll be sure to call you .
cpo snick will see you out .
we 'll see ourselves out .
okay . it 's my one job , but go ahead .
we need base access , we need to interview his shipmates , but the coast guard keeps shutting us down at every turn .
because they know something that they don 't want to tell us .
it 's a classic case of keeping something secret .
if they want to get into a jurisdictional dick-measuring contest , i 'm all for it .
it sounds like fun , and i like my chances .
go talk to the melanie burke at the d.a. ' s office and see if she can help us out .
got it .
- lieutenant . - yep ?
as predicted , the refrigerator guy came as soon as i got in the shower .
damn it !
that 's so frustrating .
it 's like they know .
so i can either wait till tomorrow at the same time , or i can go to the warehouse in long beach and talk to them .
that 's a hell of a long drive , but i don 't think it can wait .
i 'll be all right .
there 's a dave buster 's right next door .
tanner !
i 'm gonna go with you .
this guy 's going to the chair .
as god as my witness , he 's gonna fry .
just backing up a bit , we don 't know who did it .
yeah , but we appreciate your enthusiasm .
someone showed up to work today .
all right , what do you guys want , huh ?
just tell me what you want , and i 'm gonna put it in your little hands .
all right ? you want a court order ?
you want a subpoena ?
you want a grand jury ?
i 'm gonna get you a grand jury .
we 're not quite there yet , melanie , but good to know we have you in our back pocket .
all right , so hit me . anything .
give it to me .
well , i guess we could start by getting subpoenas
- for some of bucket 's shipmates .
- already done .
how about a search warrant ?
check your inbox . already there . did it this morning .
- can i use your restroom ?
- you just did .
- validate parking ?
- i would love to .
parking .
got here at 10 : 21 .
it 's 11 : 04 now , so that 's ... that 's ... that 's 28 ... 28 minutes .
no , that 's like 40 minutes .
shh . okay . these are 15-minute increments .
- there we go .
- we 'll just pay .
- i got this .
- please , just give us our ticket back .
can you just ...
'cause i had it , and now i don 't have it .
- just give it back .
- this one is ...
you can stick it together .
ahh ... oh . they 're not lickies .
it 's fine .
this is great . thank you .
come on , guys ! hurry up !
i told you . i don 't know anything about no body in no fridge .
so , no one looks into the refrigerators when you take them off the boat ?
of course . every product gets quality-controlled .
nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fridge ?
when my guys checked it , there was no body , okay ?
my guys know what they 're doing .
lieutenant , i 'm gonna need you to look away for this one .
mr. sterelli , let me ask you something .
how do you feel about dave buster 's ?
it 's the number-one destination for family fun .
- everybody knows that . - mm .
how about if i told you i had 5,000 tickets with your name all on them ?
i 'm listening .
have you had any interaction with the coast guard ?
they come around sometimes , make sure the shipments get through with no hassles .
what shipments ?
they don 't tell me nothing , and i don 't ask nothing .
every once in a while , a shipment of appliances comes off through the boat that i 'm not allowed to inspect .
they put it in a coast guard truck and take it off my hands .
that 's all i know .
anything else , you 're gonna have to ask the coast guard .
thank you , mr. sterelli .
thank you very much .
excuse me !
excuse me , seamen and women !
we 're wondering if anybody has any information on the death of charlie bucket .
i got information .
but if you want me to talk , you got to beat me .
not you .
the other lady .
seaman bucket was my bunk mate .
we were closer than brothers .
i know this is difficult , but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him ?
no .
no idea .
he was a great sailor and really popular , although , the last couple weeks , it did seem like he really had something on his mind .
i 'd say to him , " hey , charlie . you got something on your mind ? "
and he would say , " huh ? what ? "
like he had something on his mind .
you have any idea what happened to his stuff ... clothes , footlocker , detailed diary ?
yeah , i did find one detailed diary .
i didn 't think anything of it at the time .
you want to take a look at it ?
it might help .
yo .
" smash mouth " is two words .
a coast guard truck ? this late ?
we should go check it out .
we don 't have a warrant .
oh , i think we 'll be okay .
what the hell was that ?
i can 't wink .
tanner , hit the siren .
evening , detectives .
- is it ?
- how can i help you ?
how 's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look-see ?
i 'm afraid i can 't do that , detective .
i 'm on official coast guard business , so unless you want to take it up with the president of the united states ...
i 'll do that .
president obama , lieutenant pritikin atkins .
is it okay if we look inside a coast guard truck ?
thank you .
good night , sir .
- wait , can i talk to him ?
- oh . he hung up .
is he buying it ?
it 's hard to read his face .
what 's he doing now ?
he 's still looking with a suspicious look on his face .
what are you two whispering about ?
vitamins .
ke $ ha .
vice president .45 says open the back of the truck .
hey , how 's it going , eh ?
are we in america ?
canadians ?
what in the name of tim hortons is going on here ?
mr. president , we have a situation .
i didn 't know the coast guard deals in the trafficking of illegal immigrants .
there 's a lot you don 't know , detective , like how to apply eyeliner or who won best picture in 1984 .
" amadeus . "
what were you doing with a truckload of canadians ?
answer me !
okay , you want to play that game ?
well , we just found your dna on the whistle inside of seaman bucket 's throat , so you 're going down either way .
if you cooperate , maybe we can get the charges reduced .
i don 't have to answer to you . i only answer to one man .
but there is one tiny bit of information you should know .
i have a horrible shellfish allergy .
- whoa , put down the shrimp !
- don 't do it , man . no .
put it down .
no . that 's no way to go out .
- nice knowing you , detectives .
- not like this !
- put the shrimp do ...
- oh , and angie ,
- sergeant pepper says hello .
- don 't do it , man !
- dreyfuss for mayor ! - no ! no !
this is great .
case closed .
we got our murderer , and we didn 't have to watch a jury screw it up .
who wants to see a flick ?
this isn 't over .
we have to go after van zandt .
there 's a massive conspiracy going on here .
officer snick put a shrimp in his mouth just to protect it .
i don 't want to do 3-d . it makes me dizzy .
we cannot trust the coast guard to investigate itself .
i 'm not gonna stand here and watch this get lost in the shuffle .
tribeca , the buck has officially been passed .
it 's immigration and jag corp 's problem now .
we all want to put the bad guys away and see the good guys get it all wrapped up nicely , which is why i 'm thinking we see " jack reacher " at 8 : 15 .
i saw it .
brown stuff . rocks .
when did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good ?
sometimes i think we 'd make more of a difference without the badge .
you 've just been so different lately .
i 'm still incredibly attracted to you .
but something 's changed .
i 'm in a bad place , geils .
you don 't want any part of this .
we 're doing good , angie .
we 're making a difference .
at the end of the day , you just got to leave the job at the job .
you 're right .
guess i 'm just having a bad year .
i 'm gonna call it a night .
angie , promise me you won 't do anything crazy .
i promise .
set a course for dreamland .
relax .
i 'm not here to arrest you .
or sleep with you .
take me to pepper .
never .
ahh , ahh , aah ! your feet are freezing !
okay , i 'll take you !
so , what are the canadians for ?
are you putting together some kind of army ?
not soldiers .
voters .
it 's right up here on the right .
- face forward .
- thanks , commandant .
i 'm done with you .
here 's your chapstick back .
drive .
not until you tell me what the hell you 're up to .
you know what i see when i look out this window ?
no .
no more bullshit .
you 're importing canadians to vote for dreyfuss ? what is this ?
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
he 's gonna win . he 's killing dreyfuss in the polls .
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
one way or another , he 's gonna lose , and there isn 't a damn thing you can do abo ...
i 'm in .
oh . really ?
i thought that was gonna be a lot harder .
great . good news .
where do we start ?
just act normal , and at a certain point , the commandant will contact you .
i 'm really happy you 're joining us , angie .
previously on crazy ex-girlfriend ...
whatever happened with you and your ex ?
ex ?
oh , greg , i 'm sorry .
- do you love her ?
- no .
you forgive me ?
of course , i forgive you , joshy .
love doesn 't work out for me , ever .
so you are unhappy .
yeah . duh .
maybe it 's time you see what else is in your life , besides josh chan .
oh , my gosh , you have changed my life ,
dr. dream ghost akopian .
you made me see past all of my delusions that were holding me back .
josh , you don 't understand ?
you don 't see what this has all been about for rebecca ?
rebecca , are you in love with me ?

why do you have all these photos ?
yep , okay , so here 's what happened .
i had ... have ... had feelings for you , indeed , yes .
god , this is awkward , um , i came here to tell you that valencia ...
valencia and you are staying together .
- no ... i-i-i i gathered . - yeah .
i get it and that makes sense , yeah .
josh , i 'm actually very glad you 're here , because , um , i realized some things on my recent trip .
and , um , one of the things i realized is that i need to break my old patterns .
okay .
yes , uh , starting with ...
i 've been horrible to valencia , like , really horrible , and i really want to reach out to her .
- i really wouldn 't .
- i really think i should .
she really hates your guts .
understandable , and i will just have to transcend that .
i am trying to break free of anything unhealthy or damaging .
so , um , that starts with , uh , trashing these .
unless you want them .
no , no , that 's okay .
although , um , you know , some of those are great angles that you can 't get with a selfie , so , uh ...
- sure , yeah , yes . - yeah .
thanks .
okay , well , there it is .
that 's the last of the josh chan stuff .
there was stuff ?
no .
well , i guess i should go .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . of course , get out .
- get out of here . - yeah , yeah .
bye , josh .
can i get another beer ?
i 'm trying to study .
studying and drinking at the same time : good decision .
i know , right ?
it 's easy .
it 's extension school .
i-i don 't like to tell a lot of people this , but i got into emory business school .
it 's a pretty good school .
they call it like the harvard of the south .
i thought the harvard of the south was vanderbilt .
no . no . no .
yeah , so i got into school , and then my dad got sick , so now i 'm working my way through school here .
you know ?
i can 't be slinging drinks to losers until i 'm like 60 years old .
oh , boy , look at this .
just what i need .
- hi . - hey .
i thought you drank at home base .
i drink anywhere , but i do my study-drinking here .
got it .
can i pull up a stool next to you , or do you want to ... be alone ?
i could go home and drink some mouthwash .
mouthwash , wow .
that 's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself .
sad says the man with an open textbook ... next to an open container .
this is fun .
i like this .
do you want to hang out for a while and insult each other ?
ah , what would your girlfriend think about that ?
um , heather ?
uh , yeah , no , we 're done-zo .
oh , wow . i had no idea .
can i get you a drink ?
nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snark .
wait .
go back to the heather thing .
are you okay ?
let 's-let-let 's talk .
talk is not on the bar menu , but we could ask .
okay , so , yeah , here 's the thing .
old me would have been totally down for , like , an old-fashioned barb fest , but i 've decided recently that i 'm trying to change my patterns .
so i 'm gonna go .
no , come on . come on .
i 'm a glutton for punishment .
stay . let 's do this .
we can make bad decisions together .
we could run in traffic .
no ?
okay .
boy , she really digs you .
she 's in love with someone else , but i figure ten , 11 years of me trying ,
i 'm a lock .
okay , what is happening ?
why are you throwing out all this josh stuff ?
i told you , i 've gone cold turkey on the chan .
i 'm done .
it 's not good for me , and you know that .
d ... oh , g ... you have to keep the macaroni portrait .
that took two weeks .
no , no , paula , i 'm breaking my old patterns .
break old pat ... i ...
what does that even mean ?
did you go to a bumper sticker store ?
no , i just realized a lot of things on my trip to new york , while i was in a bumper sticker store .
okay , but you 're right about this , actually , it has a lot of dry goods on it , it actually could be useful for my earthquake kit ,
- so i will keep this .
- that 's my girl .
but everything else goes in the trash .
- hmm , hmm . - oh , come on .
not channy bear .
i forbid it .
fine , maybe i 'll just put channy bear on a high shelf in case of a ... bear-mergency .
but the rest of this is going , bye .
- oh , come on ... - bye , letters to josh .
first drafts , second drafts .
- in the trash .
- no .
- yep .
- that 's ...
- that 's insanity . - nope .
nope .
good-bye , josh thong that i never wo ... i don 't wear thongs .
why did i even get this ?
you have finally lost it .
you have left the reservation and i-i can 't ... i 'm not ...
i can 't watch it . i don 't care . i don 't care .
i 'm not supporting this .
no , uh-uh .
hey ... i 'm so nervous , aren 't you ?
that last test ...
was pretty easy , at least for me .
wow , that 's impressive .
you must be smart .
yeah , well .
i-i don 't like to tell people this , but , um ...
oh , you don 't have to tell me something you don 't like to ...
i got into the harvard of the south .
emory ?
you know it ?
emory ?
the harvard of the south is duke .
no .
no , no .
emory . google it .
so , everyone , overall there were some nice efforts , but , uh , some of you , i 'm sad to say , fell short .
i 'm really not sure what rubric you 're using to grade these , but ...
doesn 't take much of a rubric to see that you didn 't put in much of an effort here .
oh , well , you know , i work full-time .
my dad is sick .
i work two jobs and my husband is dead .
i am very sorry to hear that , but i ... was not involved .
your next assignment is an essay due friday .
you can do better , mr. serrano .
you got into the harvard of the south , after all , which you somehow managed to mention on your test .
a multiple choice test .
so , you 're busting my balls about an intro class at an extension school ?
cool , yeah . makes sense .
look , i don 't know you very well , but from where i stand , it seems like you 've made the choice not to try or something .
oh , please , don 't you worry about my decisions .
i will decide about my decisions .
choosing not to try , greg .
you got into emory , greg .
i mean , duh , i could have done better .
i could have gotten an " a " on that test if i 'd wanted to .

you 're an idiot .
oh , my god , this is nuts .
okay , you can 't give up on josh right now .
you are so close .
paula , he picked valencia .
like , in front of my face .
game over .
what ?
no .
game has just begun .
okay , you have antibodies to his saliva .
you cannot give up .
you have traction .
he-he touched the side of your boob , i saw it .
- can you get whoever that ...
- yeah , i will get that .
and ... just ... let 's continue the convo later , okay ?
and if it 's the people across the street from that church , just tell them i don 't believe and will never believe .
rebecca .
hello , everyone in josh 's family .
hi .
oh , my gosh .
i haven 't seen you since the last book club .
i haven 't seen you got engaged .
how does it feel ?
it feels like i 've been waiting seven years for phillip to propose , because i have .
let me see the rock .
oh , my gosh , i mean ,
phillip said he was going for it , but ...
he said you were so helpful getting it .
oh , it was no problem at all .
i helped my client , moshe , through a very complicated subdivision deal , and he said he could hook me up with non-blood diamonds at a discount .
and never pass up a good discount , right ?
i know what you 're thinking ...
like , diamonds , discounts , those are some like classic jew moves , you know ?
what are you doing here ?
jayma has something to ask you .
look , i know that this is sudden , and we haven 't known each other that long ...
god , i feel like i 'm proposing or something .
you 've been such a good friend to the family .
you wrote jastenity that letter to get into harvard .
unfortunately the letter was better than her application , but she did get into cal state northridge , which is the harvard of northridge .
yeah , it is .
anyway , what i 'm trying to say is , how would you like to be a bridesmaid at my wedding ?
you mean , be an official part of the chan fam-bam ?
she 'd love to .
you want me to be a bridesmaid .
aw , you 're such a lovely girl , rebecca .
we would be so honored if you would become a part of our family wedding .
and you are the perfect height to pair with phillip 's friend , daniel , who stopped growing after being a kid gymnast .
um , actually , i-i don 't know if i should .
okay , hey , why don 't we just ... ?
o-one second , chan ladies .
come here .
one ...
one-one second .
okay , this would kill valencia .
dead .
down in the ground .
like a bug .
legs in the air .
now she 's a ghost , boo .
okay , but , paula , what have i been saying ?
i need to disengage and disentangle from dis family .
know what i 'm saying ?
seriously , i-i want to make amends to valencia , and this is like the opposite of that .
yeah , okay , well , who says no to being a bridesmaid ?
you can 't do that .
i mean , who does that ?
monster people .
- i have a question .
- no .
is valencia a bridesmaid ?
uh , not exactly .
by that she means no .
like , ew , no .
here 's the thing , i-i 'd love to be a bridesmaid , but i don 't think it would be fair for me to be a bridesmaid and for valencia not to be .
i guess you 're right .
and josh has asked for valencia to be a bridesmaid about 50 times , so ...
great , so you get what i 'm trying to say .
so you can both be in the wedding .
sorry , what 's that ?
you and valencia can both be bridesmaids .
that way you don 't have to worry about her not being included .
very wise , jayma .
it 's settled , then .
yeah , it is !
i know you , from spider 's .
you were the sourpuss fighting with the girl in the shiny dress .
hey , i 'm , i 'm not a sourpuss .
i 'm pensive and deep .
are you dusting potatoes ?
i like to look busy .
well , you 're out of dark roast .
i can 't study without dark roast .
could you get on that ?
oh , yeah , sure , uh , no problemo .
thanks .
she 's cute .
are we being pleasant now ?
sorry , i don 't know your rules .
so , you two an item ?
me and ally ?
oh , i wish .
she quit her job as a manager at a whole foods , came to work here .
i could not figure out why for the longest time .
and then i realized ...
hey , i know that guy .
♪ grocery clerk with half an eyelid . ♪
his name is brody .
i can 't compete with him .
he has the flattop of a greek god .
this !
whoa , you are so good at magic .
how do you do it ?
uh-uh-uh . a true magician never reveals his secrets .
come on , brody .
so you like her .
yeah .
i don 't have a shot .
i mean , look at her .
i should give up .
i know that 's the right decision .
are you sure ... she doesn 't like you ?
watch this .
ally .
ally , though .
that 's my type , too .
oh , that 's so hot .
okay , bro , i gotcha .
i know exactly what you need to do .
so , you and valencia are friends ?
uh , kinda .
i 'd say we share a history of common interests .
of course , she 's late .
she 's the kind of person that has to make an entrance .
you know what ? i don 't think that 's fair .
i wouldn 't stereotype her as someone that ...
oh , sorry i 'm late .
i just had some pictures taken for my hometown hotties submission to maxim .
we ready to try on some dresses ?
jas , come on .
let 's go pick out the first round of dresses .
this is beautiful .
- hey . - whoa !
hey , valencia , hi , oh , uh , this is going to be so fun .
are you ready to be , like , bridesmaid buddies ?
i want to make myself very , very clear .
i know what happened .
i know about the kiss .
and if it were any other situation , i would take off my earrings , my extensions , and my wings , and curb-stomp you .
got it , that 's fair .
but , for some reason , you 're the one that got me into this wedding party .
josh told me it was all you .
- he did ? - yep .
i mean ,
i don 't know why you did it , but i don 't care .
just stay out of my way and don 't make me look bad to these people .
hey , valencia , i can do better than that .
i can make you look good .
yeah , yeah , like , by the end of this , they 're going to want to adopt you .
but maybe that 's not , like , precisely what you want , but ...
oh , just shut up .
how about this ?
this seems like a style that would work on everyone .
well , most of us .
valencia 's right .
uh , you know , uh , two-piece , halter , mesh dress might work well for you very lean ladies , but , yeah , not for this festival of back fat going on .
okay , well , what about ... this ?
oh , my god .
those are such beautiful nipple covers .
yeah , those would definitely cover most of my nipples .
yeah , guys , let me remind you , i eat bagels at night ...
valencia knows .
she knows all about my night bagels ... tell ' em , v .
here 's what you didn 't know .
for my midnight bagel , i eat it with butter , cream cheese , and ... bacon .
seriously . s-r-s-l-y .
like , true story .
okay , so why don 't we try different styles in the same color ?
that 's a great idea .
that 's so ni ...
you know what ? i 'm gonna go out on a limb and say that 's , like , really gracious .
it is , actually , a , a good idea .
so you kids can go crazy with your halters and your sheaths and your cutouts , and i will wear a dress fit to upholster a chair .
and i will wear it with pride .
rebecca , come on .
yeah , you 're not that disgustingly fat .
aw , thank you , valencia .
thank you .
paula .
what have we said about standing places , quietly waiting for people ?
i forgot .
okay , so how did it go with valencia at the dress shop ?
did you find any weaknesses ?
i was thinking that we could use your role as bridesmaid to really mess her up .
my first thought was poison oak in the dress .
rashy nips , instant classic . paula .
what ?
we 're not doing any of that .
- we 're not .
- no .
we 're just acting like normal people .
i 'm going to be like any other teenage ex-boyfriend 's sister 's last-minute bridesmaid .
yeah , so just be cool .
understood .
i have my orders .
where can a person buy poison oak , and what is the rashiest kind ?
richard kind is a 59-year-old actor , best known for his role in spin city .
no . poison oak , rashiest kind .
jim rash is the award-winning writer of the descendants .
come on .
you 're sure this is a good idea ?
dude , she doesn 't like you .
she 's shown no interest .
she 's way into someone else .
why give up now ?
this is the right move .
um , can i have everyone 's attention , please ?
hey , someone 's trying to let it rip here .
- thank you , greg .
- you 're welcome .

when are you getting the bridesmaid gowns ?
'cause i got a guy in maine who 's going to send me some primo itchy , sticky plants .
and he said he was going to throw in a couple deer ticks for , you know , a little extra ...
um , what are you talking about ?
our plan - rashy nips .
- oh . - i say we roll the dice for , you know , some possible lyme disease .
i have so much to say ...
hold on one second .
oh , oh , it 's from jayma .
it says emergency .
sos . 411 .
she means 911 .
i wonder if phillip got cold feet .
i have to go .
- what ?
- i have to go , i 'm sorry .
what about our plan ?
there 's no plan .
the dance we do .
- hey , what 's the emergency ?
- i don 't know , do you ?
guys .
there 's something i need to tell you .
and it won 't be easy .
my dress is done early , and i brought champagne !
cheers !
valencia 's so funny .
oh , valencia , tell them about the part with the old lady .
yeah , so , this 90-year-old lady was in downward dog , and i said to her , " okay , just breathe into it . "
and she said ,
" if i breathe into it any harder , i 'm gonna toot . "
oh , she 's so funny .
she has a million yoga stories like these .
they 're great .
well , i 've been practicing my humor .
i watched an online tutorial .
this was so much fun , you guys .
when joshy and i get married , i want all of you to be in the wedding .
except for you .
i mean , would it kill you to say something ?
she 's not wrong , ruby .
you 're a dud .
ah , man , i am tipsy .
this was so fun .
oh , jas , we got to go meet mom at the cake-tasting .
can you guys stay and make skee the dress gets packed away perfectly ?
like no wrinkles or bubbles .
absolutely .
we 're on it .
valencia and i got this .
yep , we got it .
thanks , v .
you know , we all thought you were heinous , but you 're kind of okay .
- all right , bye , ladies .
- bye , jayma .
drink a glass of water .
they don 't think i 'm heinous anymore .
jastenity even offered me a half stick of gum .
i said no because i bloat , but still ...
congrats .
well , i guess we should , um , get the girls to pack up this big-ass dress .
yeah , okay .
wow , this would look even worse on me than some of the others .
oh , come on , stop .
i mean , you make jokes about your body , and they 're pretty funny and mostly accurate , but with your big boobs , that dress would look great .
are you kidding ?
no .
i 'd be spilling out of this thing , and not like in a sexy , on purpose ,
christina hendricks type of way .
so ?
guys don 't care .
guys love big boobs like yours .
i mean , sometimes i hate my small boobs .
i mean , i thought about getting implants .
what ?
no , don 't do that .
oh , my gosh , valencia , if you knew what went into having a pair of monsters like these , you would never think about getting them again .
i 'm gonna show you .
rebecca , you can 't .
