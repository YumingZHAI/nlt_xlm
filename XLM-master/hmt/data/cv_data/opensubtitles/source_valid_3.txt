and i 'm not gonna kill the ruptals !
i need you to help save those men !

larry , i do not want to have my baby in a garage !
what the fuck , larry , you 're supposed to take her to the hospital !
there 's no time .
the head ...
the head !

look , as i have explained - repeatedly - we can 't risk involving the authorities !
richard is an escaped felon !
i 'm not !
try to hold on until i get my place back .
fuck you !
would someone just call me a cab ?
you 're a cab .
i 'll call my own cab .
my kid is gonna have an old man that he can be proud of .
how much time do i have ?
the contractions are four minutes apart .
godspeed , richard .
godspeed !
i gotta lie down !
listen , for the love of kid , i 'll help you .
but you 've gotta promise me ...
you promise me that when you talk to the ruptals , you will not tell them that i have to kill them .
give me the dealership , pronto , or josh will have to kill you .
dude !
really ?
josh , surely this is a joke .
tell them .
operation blackout .
terminate suspected terrorists
ruptal jhalalawan and ruptal jhalalatu .
with extreme prejudice .
it was nose hair clippers , okay ?
i ... i could never hijack a plane with nose hair clippers !
it 's not just that .
the feds have a file on you a mile thick .
for what ?
c-4 in your stationary closet ?
no , that was me .
or the jihad that you declared on ken ?
no , that was fitz .
all this time , i was a mission ?
i thought we were friends .
hey , wait ... wait !
you were a mission ...
became a friend .
bottom line is you 're dead men if you stay here .
you sign over your shares in the dealership to me , i 'll get you new identities , a ride .
we 'll fake your deaths .
i have no doubt you 're an expert in faking things .
we 'll give you until midnight .
ring a ding ding .
listen , i -
cousin , this is perfect !
by the time they uncover our treachery , we 'll be .. " dead . "
we sell the dealership three times !
wonderful !
wish i were dead .
all right , you take care of the ids , the car , and faking their deaths .
i 'll get a burger .
ruptal loved burgers .
with pickles .
[ phone rings ] fuck .
too late , shit bubble .
i just signed a deal with the ruptals .
by midnight , the dealership will be mine .
i need to talk to you about something .
about what ?
the father / son dance i was gonna ask you to .
what the fuck do you think ?
the gay mob nabbed me off exit 9 .
i need you to get my wurlitzer from the storage unit .
and why should i give a fuck ?
because you helped this repressed cock-lover get it out of florida .
that puts both of you on my shit list !
[ cocks gun ] that 's not a list you want to be on , sugar .
look , just get the thing , will ya !
all right , fine .
i 'll get your fuckin ' wurlitzer .
on one condition ...
you 're in no position to negotiate , slick .
i was talking to the half-sack .
i do this for you , you drop your bid for the dealership .
got it ?
fuck .
deal .
you got one hour .
larry , get me out of here ...
don 't think of this as a garage , think of it as an automotive birthing station .
huh ?
my child will be born in a crack den .
you couldn 't put down some plastic first ?
where 's richard ?
i don 't know .
don 't worry , ali devon , i will find him .
you stay with her .
tell me you know something about delivering a baby because i have no fucking idea .
let uncle joshy handle this .
for he has an earthquake kit .
ali-bear !
it 's chester !
chester vince !
look , i don 't care what some dna test or a restraining order says , i am that child 's father , okay ?
i massaged that belly , and i sang to that foetus , and i was the one who slept on the couch !
so give me a chance !
a chance to be the most attentive father in the world !
well , it 's official .
chester vince has been appointed vacated seat of disgraced councillor and felon at large , richard fitzpatrick .
don 't forget your friends on the air , mr. vi-
sweet mother of zeus ! [ tires squeal ]
fuck me .
didn 't that twat farm ever throw anything away ?
ah !
oh !
richard ?
don 't worry , i left ali with josh .
you fucking idiot !
i 'm trying to show her i 'm not a loser , and now josh is the first face that kid is gonna see ?
right .
fuck .
oh , what 's the fucking point ?
the kid deserves better - not an old man who 's a-
don 't you say it , richard .
because it is not true .
you are not the l word .
people do not depend on people who are the l word .
and right now , there are a lot of people depending on you , mister .
so you find your self-esteem , and we will find that jukebox .
you just have to dig a little deeper .
is it a speech impediment that makes you always sound like a greeting card ?
no , really , we just have to dig a little deeper .
huh ?
here we go ...
well , looky-looky .
ta da !
huh ?
now what do you say we get a dilapidated wurlitzer to a homicidal homosexual ?
this thing is a piece of shit .
how come that fruit-cup has such a hard-on for it ?
it 's not worth 40 k .
it 's gotta be some kind of scam .
that shit i said ?
yeah ?
fuck that .
fitzy 's no loser .
i 'm a fuckin ' genius .
oh , let 's see here .
headlamp , hand-cranked radio / flashlight , cyanide pills , uh ... glowstick !
it 's like a rave in a bucket !
ever since i was a little girl with a doll and a toy stroller , i didn 't want kids !
i don 't even like kids !
me neither !
let 's see here , uh ...
all right !
congratulations !
you 've just survived an earthquake ...
oh !
god , what was i thinking ?
a single thirty-something mother , no husband , no prospects , not a single shard of self-respect !
oh !
i think i can see the baby !
ha !
he 's got short , curly black hair in the shape of a lightning bolt .
it kind of looks like harry potter !
oh !
okay ...
oh god !
let 's see !
ah ...
good .
very good .
that 's it ?
all you wanted was some fucking record ?
not just some record ...
" the " record !
bananarama 's greatest hit ?
hey , watch your mouth , boy .
you 're fucking with an antiques dealer .
a deal 's a deal .
and you asked for the wurlitzer , so ...
it 's all yours .
and it 's a bitch to move .
drive safe , mr vasquez .
if you 're ever in miami stay the fuck away from my shop .
see you later , old man .
i got a kid to make proud .
not if i get there first .
hey !
we had a fucking deal !
yeah , that 's cheating !
no , it 's fitzpatrick !
$ 300,000 , cash !
josh has your new identities .
there 's a van on the lot , gassed and ready to go .
and by morning , the government will think you 're dead .
hm ...
i 'm talking real money here .
give it !
i 've got something that 'll blow the geezer 's offer out of the water .
yeah !
huh ?
give it !
did you ever hear of the legend of the lost sinatra single ?
uh-uh . only an idiot has not .
well here it is .
frank 's lone shot at a rock ' n ' roll career reboot .
he only had one single pressed .
hated it , and had the master tapes destroyed .
but a technician hid the 45 in the one place he knew frank would never look .
the wurlitzer !
from the sands !
motherfucker !
you switched it out !
yeah .
[ snickering ] [ whispering ] this is wrong .
if we continue this lie , we are no better than they are .
of course we are .
lie !
lie !
the only way you could beat the highest bidder , is by combining your offers .
in business with him ?
no fucking way !
[ gasp ] richard !
this is fate giving you a chance !
look , for the sake of your child , and your grandchild -
i implore you as father and son , and mentor and servant , to finally bury this hatchet !
to work together !
to carry on tradition !
to shut me up !
deal .
i 'll handle the paperwork !
you 've got a baby on the way , buddy .
nice .
motherfucker !
somebody buy me a drink !
there 's a mirror !
do you want to see ?
oh , for the love of god , no !
all right , i did it !
i own this place now !
fitzy 's no loser .
i got this .
no , don 't leave me alone with him !
oh !
i don 't care what you own !
you are the last person i want down there !
this isn 't my first pilgrimage to your promise land , baby .
now , you do what you gotta do .
oh !
you did this to me , you son of a bitch !
i will kill you for this !
yeah , anytime now .
oh !
i will cut off a limb for every stretchmark you gave me !
that 's good !
good hustle !
come on now !
come on , one more !
i will shove a cinderblock up your asshole and make you shit it out !
is it a boy or a girl ?
hey ...
oh fuck ... [ baby fussing ]
awesome .
hey buddy .
all this time i 've been vilifying fitz , but at least he 's been running around trying to make you proud .
what have i done ?
besides the biological miracle of growing you inside me ...
as per your request , miss devon , a taxi is en route to take you to the hospital .
in the meantime ,
uncle larry has just the thing to help get the little guy to sleep .
your daddy 's not a loser .
i am .
your passports , birth certificates , driver 's licenses , and library cards .
oh , and uh ...
i got you a little something as well .
come on , come on !
shut up !
you shut up !
shut up !
ruptal , listen ...
no , don 't .
i don 't think i could ever forgive your lies , josh .
i understand .
but , uh ...
craven moorehead would like to thank you for saving his life .
your accent 's gettin ' pretty good .
you 're a good teacher .
ah , just so i know ...
how will we die ?
i don 't know yet .
but i do know one thing .
it 'll be a death worthy of a friend .
oh , and , uh ...
i 'm also gonna need some teeth .
uh , hi , ali , it 's me .
uh , listen , i 'm gonna be a little bit late for our future .
okay ?
but everything 's gonna be fine .
no matter what you heard .
it 's all good .
they 're gonna take me to the home world now .
but i 'll be back soon , okay ?
i 'm ready !
you need a drink ?
now you 're speaking my language .
congratulations , richard , ken .
a new partnership , and a new fitzpatrick .
i know your relationship isn 't where you want it to be , but we 've got plenty of time to work on that .
especially if we don 't get thrown back into jail the second we walk out this door .
[ chuckles ] [ sigh ] ah , cheers .
i get the big office .
fuck that .
i built that place from the ground up .
the big office is mine .
actually , it 's mine .
a sales contract ?
you bought the dealership ?
bullshit .
where 'd you get the scratch to outbid us ?
with the money i siphoned from the ruptals ' bank accounts .
those oblivious idiots .
an unfinished contract means nada , dot .
only one signature .
well ... i still have elaine 's shares which makes us all partners .
fuck .
holy coincidence , or what !
oh ...
rest in peace , my ruptal brother .
larry , tell me you 've been keeping up our insurance premiums .
you know it , buddy .
with that money , we can build a place twice this size .
yeah ...
once again , everything works out for good old fitzy .
ring a ding ding .
rat bastard .
motherfucker .
burn , baby , burn .
yeah .
um ...
you love when i take the whole thing in my mouth .
don 't you ?
00 : 17 : 04,600 -- 00 : 17 : 06,100 i 'm gonna cum for you , actually .
00 : 17 : 09,700 -- 00 : 17 : 10,700 i 'm cumming in your mouth .
hey ...
i just finished decorating my tree ...
what do you think ?
think it looks really pretty and it matches my pretty outfit that i dressed up for you .
my boobs look really good ...
nice and big ...
do you like these gloves ?
i think they 're really sexy .
also , i have a little surprise just for you .
see ?
i 'm wearing no underwear .
i think it looks really sexy with this skirt .
do you like to watch them bouncing up and down ?
so , let 's see what santa got me for christmas .
look what i got : ...
cute little pink toy to match my outfit .
do you want to watch me play with it ?
get it all wet .
i love spitting on it .
do you like watching me play with myself ?
oh ...
yeah .
oh , my god .
um ...
tastes so good ;
i wish you could taste it .
do you want me to turn it on for you ?
hope you guys enjoyed that and happy holidays .
that 's me .
jane quimby .
my life is a little complicated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chandler murray .
the only problem , they think i 'm an adult .
now i am juggling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she 's a little shady .
i 'm afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you 're happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fellas .
here 's how it 's going down .
are you robbing this place , tommy ?
let 's go !
let 's go !
a couple months at new hall youth detention might give mr. nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , janey .
it 's not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don 't .
i can 't talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i 'm just gonna say it .
it 's you , janey .
jane .
jane !
let 's go .
you 're gonna be late for school again , truant .
that guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
ben .
it 's a little weird that you call your girlfriend " miss shaw . "
oh , you mean rita .
hey .
are you really that busy ?
yes .
and no .
i 'm nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy 's different ?
what if he doesn 't want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juvenile detention center , not a brainwashing camp .
you 'll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i 'm waiting .
bated breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , " it 's you . "
- it 's you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn 't know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it 's been playing on a loop in my head .
" it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . " what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically ?
no .
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don 't think that 's it .
but i guess it can be .
i don 't know .
maybe it is .
i don 't know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he 's my best friend and i don 't want to run the risk of ruining that , right ?
- i can 't answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
jane by design 1x11
- the replacement original air date june 5 , 2012
that 's it ?
yeah , i mean , i don 't know what else to say .
it was pretty uneventful .
you were in a juvenile detention center .
so ?
so , was it scary ?
were the guards mean ?
did you make any friends ?
how was the food ?
did you ...
jane . look .
i wasn 't in alcatraz or anything , okay ?
i just ...
i 'd rather talk about something else , okay ?
okay .
maybe we should talk about , you know ...
yeah , you !
so , what about you ?
what 's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since i 've been away ?
oh . nothing , really .
- how 's jeremy ?
- jeremy ?
yeah , you guys are together , right ?
no .
we 've never been together .
he doesn 't even know that i 'm in high school .
and we work together .
i could never do that .
speaking of work .
how is it ?
well , things have been crazy ever since india got fired .
gray has been using me for everything .
it 's nuts .
and she 's been through at least a dozen people to fill india 's job .
wow .
that 's a lot of people .
tell me about it .
and you should see the stuff that she 's having me do .
i can 't even believe it .
i mean , don 't get me wrong ,
i love being creatively involved at donovan decker ...
you okay ?
let 's just say to be back here again .
and this place same way about me .
don 't worry about them .
and , billy ...
yeah ?
are we okay ?
shouldn 't we , talk or something ?
you 've been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car , jane .
right .
i mean , about ...
we 're good .
yeah .
there 's nothing for us to talk about , okay ?
unless you want to talk about that .
you have got to be kidding me .
yep .
lulu and nick .
they 've been an item ever since you left school .
looks like it 's just back to being the two of us .
yeah .
the two of us .
jane , i have to be honest .
i 'm a little disappointed .
disappointed ?
i 'm just surprised .
that 's all .
this progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the jane quimby that i know .
your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics .
well , that 's good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceramics .
- ouch .
and it 's not just your grades .
your attendance last month ?
let 's just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
this internship is interfering with your life .
your grades aren 't what they used to be , you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can 't happen .
i know , i know .
but i 'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i 'm already here .
this is my life .
it 's just an internship , jane .
it 's not .
i 'm working with designers and i 'm being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can 't learn in a classroom .
i 'm living it every day .
you can 't buy that kind of experience , you know ?
fine .
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn 't improve , i can 't sign off on the internship program for you next semester .
especially if you 're not ...
wait .
are you texting someone right now ?
uh , what ?
no .
i am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school .
stat .
i promise i 'll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
sorry .
i know this might sound harsh , but you 've been an incredible disappointment , sally .
it 's suzy .
your work has been lackluster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at donovan decker , you 've yet to show any real promise .
but i 've only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i 'm afraid .
you 're fired .
that 'll be all .
what ?
that 's five this month , gray .
well , it 's been harder to replace india than i might 've realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i 'm not worried .
i have a new prospect in mind .
someone young and unexpected .
someone not boxed in by years of design experience .
you don 't mean ...
you 're not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next appointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
martyn !
gray , darling !
so . classic .
clean .
powerful .
it 's a whole new delicious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i 'm afraid i don 't .
i love it .
you 're a genius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hats does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that 's twice as busy since india left ?
i think we 're all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
'cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , " over whom ? " and , " in pumps or flats ? "
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don 't get your hopes up .
hey .
what can i do for you , muffin ?
that 's a " no " on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn 't quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we 're on the same page .
so , what 's up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i 'm just a little concerned .
don 't worry .
she 's good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i 'm concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she 's falling behind .
i think this internship is just too demanding on her , don 't you ?
actually , i kind of think it 's been good .
but i promise i 'll make sure she stays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depends on it ?
bingo .
i know you 've all been working tremendously hard lately .
but you 're gonna have to work tremendously harder .
donovan decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world 's most famous luxury department stores ,
harrods .
that is , unless we blow it .
and we cannot blow it .
understood ?
okay .
didn 't i fire you ?
no .
oh .
see me in my office afterwards .
the style director assigned to oversee our harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one priority ?
carter ?
um , to impress the style director and ensure harrods is confident that donovan decker has what it takes ?
precisely .
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no exceptions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
now .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn 't see .
because apparently , we 're all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suzy ?
- right .
oh , my gosh .
i 'm turning into gray , aren 't i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i 'm going to tell you something and i need you not to react , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i 'm serious , jane .
okay .
gray is giving you india 's old job .
what ?
me ?
no reaction .
right .
take over india 's job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
janey ?
you ready ?
almost !
i 'll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind handing me the milk ?
yes .
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your toast is ready .
wait .
you 're actually considering this ?
no .
yes ?
i don 't know .
i mean , taking india 's old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime .
how could i say no ?
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you 'd really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
maybe .
why ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i 'm good .
oh , you 're good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
whatever .
- so , now you 're mad at me ?
yeah .
i am .
billy , you 've been shutting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won 't even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for starters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , janey .
nothing ?
that 's your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that 's it .
there 's nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i 'm different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it 's not for the better .
i didn 't ask you , jane .
fine !
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don 't know , ben .
maybe i took your advice and i tried to talk to him about the whole " it 's you " thing and maybe it backfired .
sorry about that .
i 'm worried about billy .
it can 't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don 't know , maybe an activity or something ?
like mathletes .
or chess club .
- i 'm being serious , rita .
- so am i .
come on .
chess ?
mathletes ?
what , do you want him to be more of an outcast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were adorable doing it .
shoot .
vice principal jenkins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what 're you naughty kids up to this fine morning ?
naughty ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said " mop " !
- and i 'll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jenkins .
good morning , rita .
and ...
ben .
that was close .
no .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what 's gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kidding ?
we ooze chemistry .
don 't say ooze .
hi .
hi .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bearings back .
- that 's good .
- yep .
so , what 's been going on with you ?
sorry .
stupid question .
so , you and fadden , huh ?
how 's that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you 're precipitating .
- excuse me ?
- your calcium is starting to form a precipitate .
you should dry out the crystals .
oh .
um ...
thanks .
- busy , huh ?
- mmm-hmm .
you 're not gonna cut me any slack here , are you ?
maybe .
but just a little .
okay .
i guess i deserve that .
i 'm really sorry , jane .
for what it 's worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it 's fine .
really , i 'm just distracted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and lulu seem very happy .
yeah .
the thing is ...
i ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
oh .
yeah .
thanks .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
thanks .
first day back .
how 're you doing ?
i 'm fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i 'm adjusting .
no , i just thought now that you 're back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive outlet .
for what ?
i don 't know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
such as ...
how about football ?
seriously ?
yeah .
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you 're a little stringy , but you 're probably very elusive .
hard to tackle .
baseball ?
oh , my .
are you kidding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you 're trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not really the team sport type .
are you sure you 're doing okay ?
i 'm fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i 'd like to .
- i 'd prefer if we didn 't .
excuse me .
coming through .
i have to leave school because of an emergency at work and rita can 't know under any circumstances because then i would lose my internship and that can 't happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don 't think so .
- no way .
what ?
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don 't really like to do this sort of thing , but can 't you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cramps , anything .
i don 't like lying to rita .
it 's just a teeny-tiny little white lie .
and that 's how it all starts .
that 's correct .
fine .
i don 't need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
oops .
sorry .
sorry .
that 's okay .
hey , i 'm actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you delivering those to ?
you think i 'm a flower delivery guy ?
i did .
a second ago .
but now i 'm a little unsure .
they 're for gray chandler murray .
oh . great .
i 'm gray 's assistant .
jane .
so i can just take those to her .
i 'd rather give them to her myself if that 's okay .
the thing is gray 's not exactly the hand delivery type .
what type is she ?
she 's more of a " don 't bother me with that kind of crap " type .
so , if you 're not the flower delivery guy , who are you ?
eli .
i have an appointment with gray .
today ?
no , it 's tomorrow .
i just thought i 'd get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn 't laugh .
well , it wasn 't laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn 't have any appointments today .
well , she called me directly .
gray ?
called you ?
on the phone ?
yeah .
crazy , right ?
so , what is this appointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you 're interviewing for it ?
yeah .
are you gonna point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gosh .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
tips ?
yeah , you know , like advice for the interview .
oh , um , just don 't take anything gray says to you personally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you 're saying she 's mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she 's just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you 're here !
oh !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven 't seen you in a while .
and i know lilies are your favorite .
jane , i see you 've met my nephew , eli .
yeah , we ...
nephew ?
yeah .
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you 're warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
nephew ?
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don 't like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray 's nephew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india 's new replacement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
no .
i ...
spit it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india 's job .
you are .
where 's jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her departure .
what 'd she say ?
she said some things about cramps .
cramps .
cramps . you know , lady stuff .
i 'm not that familiar with lady stuff , so i 'd really rather not discuss it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she 'll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mmm-hmm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-caff latte .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reservation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were booked up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some strings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what 's this ?
- some sketches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the accessories line .
i 'll take a look .
impressive .
you 're still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that 's nice .
hey .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
technically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there 's no such thing .
okay , come on , i 'm serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quimby .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it 's a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i 'm an assistant .
and the closest i 've come to studying design is , i don 't know , the endless hours i spent and fashion magazines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more qualified and he 's ...
he 's nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you 've got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
thank you .
i just really don 't know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insane ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he 's back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn 't he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we 've talked about this .
you 're my mentor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to rub it in .
all i 'm saying is i don 't know if it 's the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i 'm not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it 's nothing .
sorry .
thank you .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're welcome .
sup ?
wow !
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what 's going on with you ?
i was parched .
you 're avoiding me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm trying to keep things discreet .
between us .
you know ?
you 're lying to me about jane .
what ?
no .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cramps .
did not .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you 've got me really worried about these cold cramps .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going with you .
and if jane isn 't home sick in bed , that internship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
now !
- what happened ?
the collective brain power of you and me .
that 's what happened .
you said cramps , didn 't you ?
there 's no time for blame .
yes . i said cramps .
you just couldn 't stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she 's coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can 't you just call her ?
i 've called her like a dozen times .
it keeps going to voicemail .
ben , it 's just the whole racing to save jane thing , it 's not really my problem anymore .
look .
i 'm not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us .
otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she 's my sister .
i can 't bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can 't compete with this guy .
trust me .
she 's not going to hire her nephew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn 't go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn 't exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at donovan decker .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you 're already selling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i 'm just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materials , but i love it .
and that 's what it 's all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he 's perfect .
he 's charming and talented and good-looking
he 's not that good-looking .
i 'm serious , jeremy .
there 's no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i 'm up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it 's a courtesy , jane .
a family obligation .
this is gray we 're talking about .
she 's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i 'm always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we 're going .
understood ?
understood .
and if i find out you are lying , we 're gonna have a serious issue .
i 'm pleased to announce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by india jourdain .
- it 's you .
- what ?
i 'm certain of it .
this person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style .
this person is destined to be a rising star here at donovan decker .
this person is ...
wait !
what , jane ?
i 'm sorry .
i just ...
i can 't .
can 't ?
i can 't do this .
i 'd like to take myself out of the running .
i 'm so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don 't think i 'm ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i 'm pleased to introduce our newest designer ,
eli chandler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cramps , didn 't he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn 't think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed .
what do you think 's faster right now ?
5th or lex ?
we 're gonna have to ...
you came for me .
i did .
and i 'm not gonna let that be for nothing .
come on .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i 'm on my way to the house .
i 've stalled as long as i can and i just can 't keep lying to rita .
your chariot awaits .
mmm-hmm .
drive .
now .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a shortcut .
- oh !
come on , janey !
oh , wait .
pajamas !
jane ?
jane ?
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i 'm feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cramps .
so i just needed to ...
double whammy .
hmm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i 'm sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole manhunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for questioning you , accusing you of lying .
i don 't know what got into me .
i think you 're just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors , that 's all .
thank you .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gosh .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn 't even being offered ?
so embarrassing .
it wasn 't so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad .
i counted eight people cringing .
did you count me ?
okay .
nine .
i know you wanted that job .
honestly , i wasn 't ready to leave being a teenager behind just yet .
and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you 'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , " it 's you , "
and i need to know if you meant ...
i meant
that it 's you , janey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don 't want that to ever change .
because that 's what 's most important , right ?
yeah .
it is .
remember .
we must impress this harrods style director at any cost .
donovan is depending on us .
hello , losers .
that 's right .
i 'm the one you 've been waiting for .
where 's jane ?
i can 't wait to catch up .

i 'm the man whose money you took . he 'll get done , sooner or later . i made a call .
the vat man .
well done on bringing us the money . welcome to morocco .
help ! help ! for your own sake , i suggest you answer these questions truthfully .
why are you on this boat ?
that 's ... er ... that 's all of us going on a fishing trip .
i remember that day ... happy times .
you are putting a bag in the car . what was it ?
probably fishing gear .
bax ?
quinn ?
tell me about this , please .
where did you learn how to do this ?
what is happening here ?
that 's ... that 's just lads on holiday , innit ?
you know , things get a bit out of control .
hello ?
who 's there ?
hello ?
who are you ?
where are my friends ?
you all ok ?
they ... shaved me . and they bust my new glasses .
where are we ?
said morocco , didn 't they ?
yeah , i know that . but where ?
did they show you the pictures ?
what pictures ?
what do you say to ' em rick ? nothing .
obviously . don 't tell them anything , all right .
not until we get some kind of legal representation . someone from the embassy - amnesty or someone . how you gonna get in touch with them ?
who are they anyway ?
they 're some kind of militia or something , aren 't they ?
they knew we had that money . they picked us off . they 're probably using the money for some extremist movement .
he was wearing a shirt , with a marks and spencer 's label on . i saw it sticking out .
who ? my interrogator . i mean , extremists ...
they might .
shall we go and help him ?
best not to get involved .
you all right , mate ?
it 's a woman . serious . it 's a bird !
argh ! i was just trying to see if you were ok . i 'm quinn .
what sort of fag name is that ?
dunno . ask my dad . named after my grandfather , i think .
i 'm mercedes . hi .
- your dad into cars then ?
- heard of the count of monte cristo , dumb fuck ?
yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , i dunno , i can 't remember .
can i just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
it 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want . who are they ?
a bunch of cocksuckers ! come on ! do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the british government ?
yeah , it 's easy . they 're in there . eh ?
what ?
it 's the foreign office . sorry . what is this place exactly ?
it 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
a week ago , i was standing in line , holding a tuna baguette , queuing up for easyjet . now i 'm being fucking renditioned !
" dear god , please help me see danger coming my way , " and forgive the body count i will be sending your way . "
" never pick up a dead man 's gun . " " i ... .. " heart ...
right . we should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here . there 's laws and protocols ...
you think they 'll care about that ? they still have to abide by them .
woody , this is our government . governments can 't just hold us indefinitely for no reason . what you on about ?
course they can ! they do it all the time . you remember those plane spotters in greece ?
they said they were spies . and what about guantanamo ?
nobody even knew who was in there . get off ! come on !
all right ?
how did you end up here then , love ?
i was in kabul , " love . "
you in the army then ?
no , i went there because i like the opera .
didn 't like what i saw , so i went awol . took a long fucking walk . posted some things on the web .
secrets ? there are no secrets . only hidden truths .
how long do they usually keep people in here for ? as long as they want . that 's the point .
fellas , can i ... have a word ? in private .
this could be a trick . she could be working for them .
you not seen her face ?
what , you not talking to me now ?
i ain 't the enemy . anyway , if i wanted info out of you , i 'd just .... .. beat it out of you .
ever had a cauliflower ear , quinn ? or a wet willy ?
you know what churchill said ?
fuck off !
" if you 're going through hell , keep going . "
tough it out , guys ! you can get through this . you got each other for a start .
put our time to good use . only trying to help , knobhead . well , you 're not .
so , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , quinn ?
i don 't think anything , bax . because i 'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the sahara fucking desert . and why am i here ?
because you persuaded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh . " i persuaded you ? you called me .
i 've never called you , baxter . i 've never called you because i cannot bear your incessant moaning and complaining . oh , right , great - thanks .
yup . here we go . here we go .

i watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out . yeah , me too .
shit , no ... come on . let 's not think the worst .
hiya . i think there 's more grub on the side . just help yourself .
we 've been worried sick . you 've been gone all night . what happened ?
i dunno ... weird . they asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and toast .
you should get some . come , please . oi !
sit .
fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
all we wanted to know was who you were financing . we weren 't financing anyone .
we were just trying to get home . with five million euros ?
we have at our disposal dna databases , forensic analysis , satellite imaging technology . if that doesn 't give us what we need , we employ enhanced interrogation techniques .
if we want to find out the truth , we do . and now , we have .
we made a mistake . it happens . so ...
just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
hang on . does that mean that we can ... ? please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?
little candle-lit vigil ?
coloured rubber wrist bands - " free mercedes . "
take care .
mrs peters . 101 bridge road , crawley . it 's my mum . just let her know i 'm all right .
you take care of yourself .
seriously ?
did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
two nights in . nah ... thought that was it .
what went through your mind ?
well , first of all , my kids ... carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ... i thought i 'd never get to see united play again .
i kept thinking of my kids . kept seeing their little faces . then i thought about nina ....
i wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what i 'm like . be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your porno collection . nah , i don 't know .
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to spain and actually ending up in morocco .
if anyone so much as mentions " bad luck , " they 're walking . be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour . haven 't seen so much as a camel .
he 's gone .
he 's not coming back , is he ?
two stay , two go and get help . shouldn 't we all go ? why ?
or stay ? we 'll double our chances if we split . halve them you mean .
i do . i do . i do .
i 'll go . come on . you two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
do you believe in destiny , bax ? no .
so shut up .
fate then ?
rick , please . no destiny , no fate , no karma , no spells , no curses .
this is just a series of misunderstandings , ok ?
could have happened to anybody . no more , no less .
who 's ... ?
come on !
get in . you are about to be shot , get in !
bax , get in .
woods ! quinn ! hey !
- we had some disturbing intel . - well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
i 'd like to know what 's going on , please . a covert department of the cia , the special activities division has activated a kill contract on you . sorry ?
what are you talking about ? evidently , you 've intersected a line of narco-finance and ... wait .
your man in majorca ... .. has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the american security services . what ?
he 's paying the cia to protect him ?
narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for american black ops . - like a five-year-old , please .
not really new news . why would they want to kill us ?
one of you tipped off the authorities in the uk . a contact inside customs and excise .
your man here retaliated by telling the special activities division you were about to blow their op wide open . so now they have to take you out . no , this ... this is crazy .
this goes higher than us . this kind of thing brings down governments . iran contra anyone ?
which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation . they can 't just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together . under the aegis of " the global war on terror , " they can shoot anyone they like .
the cia ? no .
they 'd have tasked local contractors . so nothing can be linked back to them . you got lucky ...
but this isn 't going to go away . ok , let 's get practical , then . so what are the options ?
well , there must be something ?
right ... right - there may be a solution but we have to act now . like , this minute .
then i 'm afraid you 're on your own . how long would this be for ?
maybe for ever .
- we can never go home ?
- it 's the only offer on the table .
no , no , no , that 's ... that 's not an option .
no . i 'm going home and ... if you go back , you 'll be putting your families at risk as well .
ok , let me just see if this is even logistically possible .
stand up . get up .
we can do it . we have a scrambled phone link . you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circumstances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
amy ... yeah , i know , i 'm sorry that i haven 't rung .
listen to me for a second , love . nina ... just stop , just let me talk , darling , ok ?
right ... there 's no easy way of saying this , ok , so i 'm just going to say it straight out . i 'm not coming back .
if i 've only got one call , which one do i call ? you can 't make me choose . i need you to phone my folks ,
where are they ?
shit ... i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much ... i don 't know how long .
.. because that is not what 's happened . i 've met someone .
oh , amy ... please , just tell the kids , ok , that it 's not because of them , i 'm sorry nina .
no , no , everything 's fine . it 's just ... i think i 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
what ?
well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
i can 't hear you rachel , say that again .
take care ?
yeah , ok . i will . you too .
fuck ... no , no , you 're right , i 'm sorry , i know i shouldn 't swear . dad , listen to me , ok ?
you 've been brilliant , dad .
yeah , just take care . yeah ... i love you , dad .
i know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ? you think it 's my fault because i phoned the vat man .
it 's nobody 's fault , rick . it 's just ... i don 't know , the universe conspiring against us or something .
a fly saved my life . what ?
out in the desert . if it hadn 't been for that fly , i 'd have had my head blown off . and the weird thing was , we 'd met before .
any idea where we 're going yet ?
is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
bax ?
what you going to call yourself ?
what do you mean ?
your name .
we can 't use our own names right ?
hey ... i 'm gonna be floyd . that 's what i 'm gonna call myself .
you can 't call yourself that . why ?
it 's a black name . is it ?
it 's like calling yourself ... everton or tyrell , or something . you can 't .
tony smith . my name 's tony ... smith .
why can 't i be tony smith ? you call yourself whatever you like , mate . sir tony smith if you want , mate .
if i was a girl , i 'd call myself ... .. well , hope . you could be bob hope . new hope .
new house .
jamie .... jamie kirk , then . blake ...
tony smith , adam newhouse , jamie kirk and ... .. blake hatch . hatch . welcome to your new fucking lives .
where are we ?
south africa .
we 're on the other side of the world . do they speak english here ?
uh ... i think so . what 's it like ?
i don 't know . this will all sort out , won 't it ?
eh ? a week from now , we 'll be in a pub in london , we 'll be laughing about this . some rand to get you through the first few weeks .
how do we get in touch with you ?
you don 't . right , ok . - how do we keep in touch ?
- you won 't be able to . it 's too dangerous . hang on a minute .
what happens if it 's safe for us , if it becomes safe for us to go home , to break cover ? how will we know that ?
as far as anyone else knows now , you don 't exist . that 's your best chance of surviving . if you want to stay alive , stay invisible .
the truth will come out though , won 't it ? in the end . ok , let 's go .
say your goodbyes . come on , move this thing along . come on , people .
take care of yourselves .
woody .
hey , we shouldn 't be on our own . listen , i know i said some things ... .. but you boys mean a lot to me , all right ? and you always will .
quinn , quinn , come on . guys , come on , we should stay together , yeah ? we 're a team now .
right , boys ... chin up . at least we 're still standing , eh ?
you 'll be all right , bax . what makes you say that ?
you 're smart . i 'm not that fucking smart .
good luck .
hey . what about if just me and him , we stick together ?
- it 'll be all right , won 't it ? - no . - listen , nobody has to know .
you 'll be all right . i can 't do this woody . yes , you can .
you 're strong , mate . you 're stronger than you think . no , i 'm not .
woods , let 's not do it , yeah ? you and me , we 'll stay together , yeah ?
woods ... woody ... woody , let me go with you , yeah ?
please , woody . woody , let me come with you , please . hey !
woody ... woody , i don 't want to be on my own ! woody , please .
woody , mate . don 't leave me , please . woody !
i know every disgraced politician , every gem smuggler , every high-stakes gambler and gold digger that come through those doors . why you never go away ?
you don 't even leave cape town . if you love her so much , why don 't you marry her ? yeah , why don 't you marry me and take me to england ?
your name isn 't newhouse is it ?
how dare you , and how dare you try and blackmail me !
help !
previously on siberia ... ( indistinct shouting )
a tiger !
a fucking tiger !
i couldn 't believe it .
it was like something a seven year old would tell me ...
" oh , i saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- what are you doing ?
- wondering what would do that to a tiger .
oh , hell .
it 's on fire ...
and it 's green ...
- what 's on fire ?
- the sky .
you know , there 's something about carolina .
i feel like i recognize her .
- fire in the woods , man .
- ( man ) got to get some water .
i told you this was a mistake !
that 's all we had , man .
that 's all we had .
does anyone recognize this ?
we found johnny 's shirt .
and it was full of food from the shed .
( johnny ) i get what it looks like .
i see that .
but i didn 't steal the food , and i didn 't burn down the shed .
someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
people weren 't taking too kindly me being at camp ' cause apparently i stole food from the shed and then burned it down .
someone framed me .
they wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
i don 't know who did it .
you know , frankly , i don 't really care anymore , you know ?
i don 't really need them anyways .
you know , obviously , i can take care of myself .
took them how long to build a fire ?
i did it in five minutes in the dark .
( daniel ) i can 't believe
johnny 's gonna just stay out in the woods .
that 's crazy .
and why shouldn 't he ?
after all the crap that he 's pulled ?
he 'll be fine .
and if he 's not , you got a better chance of winning .
and you can keep his bed .
i want to make it to the end , but i want to do it as a team , kind of like how neeko 's doing it , you know ?
can i tell you something ?
( daniel ) sure .
you 're a smart guy .
you know that neeko is a professional athlete ?
he plays game for living .
how about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trusts him , just to win the game ?
have you ever thought about it ?
i don 't think you should trust him .
( sam ) can 't trust anybody .
guys ?
i get up early , and as soon as i open the door , i practically ran into this spear that 's stuck in the ground .
it felt like a threat .
let me see .
( woman ) what does it say ?
it says ... ( speaks russian )
( woman ) what is that ?
it means " get out . "
it 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
it 's a nice prop .
look at it .
it 's not real .
nice scare tactic .
they 're watching .
i 'm sure they 're loving this .
( woman ) why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
who wants you guys to get out ?
( man ) well , this is here on purpose .
that 's for sure .
it 's here on purpose .
it 's here for a reason .
you guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this , really ?
( daniel ) who else could 've left that spear ?
besides production , who could 've done it ?
we 're the only people out here .
aren 't we ?
♪
- are you okay ?
- i 'm fine .
i mean , aren 't you still scared ?
the spear this morning telling us to leave ?
that doesn 't scare you at all ?
i think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
i miss home .
i miss my family .
i even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend .
this place is-- it 's getting to me .
i don 't know .
i 'm thinking about pushing the button .
i don 't want you to go .
you know what i mean ?
i think-- i think we can win this .
we just need to--
but i don 't need to stay .
i don 't understand why i 'm even staying .
i don 't need the money that badly .
i do .
annie .
( sam ) i 've been a lone wolf for a while , you know ?
i 've been on my own for a while .
i 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than i have been in a long time because i 'm interacting with people more often than i have in many years .
now i consider daniel a friend .
he 's a good kid .
if i had a son , i 'd be proud if he was like daniel .
what are you looking at ?
- just watching those two .
- mm-hmm .
( daniel ) i don 't want to overstep my bounds , you know .
i don 't know how she feels about me , and so i 'm just kind of--
i 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard ' cause i really want to , you know , see where this is gonna go .
i don 't know .
at the same time , i don 't want to get hurt .
don 't worry .
she knows you exist .
how would i really get her to ?
i don 't know , like ...
get her to what ?
like me like me .
you can 't get her to like you .
either she does or she doesn 't .
you know ?
( laughs )
how beautiful is it ?
this is so nice .
_
why not ?
_
( laughs )
i 'm sorry .
i 'm being naughty .
it 's beautiful in , though .
_
you must be hot .
come on .
_
- no good ... _
- no one 's here .
- it 's trouble .
no one 's here .
i 'm not gonna tell anyone .
you want to come .
- oh , yeah ?
_
you 'll thank me once you 're in here .
it 's beautiful .
_
careful .
_
i 'm gonna film us .
_
( laughs ) it 's a great idea .
( laughs )
you promise you 'll erase it ?
_
- promise me ?
- i promise .
good .
annie ?
wait , annie .
you shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
it 's not safe .
_
what are you talking about ?
come on , it 's not safe .
stop . wait .
don 't be like this .
be like what ?
look , i-- ( sighs )
it 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
i 'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend , and i get that you 're sad about that .
but you 're forgetting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
no , i 'm not .
( annie ) i like her .
it 's been a while since i 've been with anybody , but i--
we get along so well .
i just feel like a dumbass now .
i mean , she 's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- hey .
- ( irene ) hey .
- there you are .
- ( irene ) how 's it going ?
good .
i just wanted to talk to you .
uh-huh ?
um , so , victoria 's gone .
um , i 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
oh , it 's-- well , it 's free right now .
so no one would mind if i moved in ?
um ... yeah , yeah .
i mean , i don 't mind .
i don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
( esther ) awesome .
all right , i 'll go grab my things .
it 's not that i didn 't have fun with the boys .
i don 't know .
i just feel like my time there is done .
it 's served its purpose , and i want to--
i want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- ( miljan ) hey .
- hey .
- ( miljan ) what are you doing ?
- i 'm leaving .
you mean the show ?
( esther ) ( laughs ) no , you idiot .
i 'm gonna move into victoria 's old bed .
wait .
why ?
why ?
because it 's free .
( miljan ) i know , but i thought you liked it here with me .
you said we are great roommates .
yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
just , i don 't know .
i want to be with the girls now .
come on , esther .
don 't you think we should team up ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
we are both smarter than everyone else here .
we can win this thing-- together .
ohh , i like your style .
i will think about it .
but hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
i was just thinking that we could have something ... ( esther ) you thought what ?
that we could get romantic a little bit ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
( miljan ) don 't laugh .
really ?
i don 't do romance .
look , we 're playing a game .
( miljan ) what do you mean ?
( esther ) i 'm playing a game-- for money .
i don 't do romance , and i 'm not playing a dating game .
i 'm sorry .
fuck you , bitch !
fuck you , bitch !
you 're not going anywhere .
get the fuck off me !
( miljan ) i 'm kidding .
( laughing ) i was just kidding , esther .
i 'm just kidding .
esther .
( esther ) don 't you fucking touch me again .
( miljan ) come on ! i 'm just-
- i was just kidding !
( esther ) i think i was in shock .
i-i don 't know .
it happened so quickly .
but he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bunk , and then he backed off .
( miljan ) esther is a player .
we all know that .
and i played with her , too .
so she was on the way out .
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jokingly , like pretending that i 'm like scaring her .
" you 're gonna stay here , " or something .
she just , like , freaked out .
she pushed me away .
she 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
stormed out , like mad .
and i was just telling her , " i 'm joking .
you know me . i always joke around .
i was just joking with you . "
i didn 't get it , seriously .
she just freaked out , and it was just a pure joke .
what are you showing me ?
it was right here .
( carolina ) are you sure ?
( neeko ) big huge carcass .
guts hanging out and everything .
look .
look at what ?
the blood ?
it could 've been anything .
it could 've been a bird . it could 've been a deer .
( neeko ) why would i make this up ?
why would i lie ?
there was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there .
i guess they took it .
the producers took it .
you gotta help me save ' em !
no , fuck that , josh !
i 'm an escaped fucking felon !

don 't you say it , richard .
because it is not true .
you are not the l word .
people do not depend on people who are the l word .
and right now , there are a lot of people depending on you , mister .
so you find your self-esteem , and we will find that jukebox .
you just have to dig a little deeper .

frank 's lone shot at a rock ' n ' roll career reboot .
he only had one single pressed .
hated it , and had the master tapes destroyed .
but a technician hid the 45 in the one place he knew frank would never look .
the wurlitzer !
from the sands !
motherfucker !
you switched it out !
yeah .
[ snickering ] [ whispering ] this is wrong .
if we continue this lie , we are no better than they are .
of course we are .
lie !
lie !
the only way you could beat the highest bidder , is by combining your offers .
in business with him ?

[ gasp ] richard !
this is fate giving you a chance !

what have i done ?
besides the biological miracle of growing you inside me ...
as per your request , miss devon , a taxi is en route to take you to the hospital .
in the meantime ,
uncle larry has just the thing to help get the little guy to sleep .
your daddy 's not a loser .

oh , and uh ...
i got you a little something as well .
come on , come on !

ruptal , listen ...

craven moorehead would like to thank you for saving his life .
your accent 's gettin ' pretty good .
you 're a good teacher .
ah , just so i know ...
how will we die ?
i don 't know yet .
but i do know one thing .
it 'll be a death worthy of a friend .
oh , and , uh ...
i 'm also gonna need some teeth .
uh , hi , ali , it 's me .
uh , listen , i 'm gonna be a little bit late for our future .
okay ?
but everything 's gonna be fine .
no matter what you heard .
it 's all good .
they 're gonna take me to the home world now .
but i 'll be back soon , okay ?
i 'm ready !
you need a drink ?
now you 're speaking my language .
congratulations , richard , ken .
a new partnership , and a new fitzpatrick .
i know your relationship isn 't where you want it to be , but we 've got plenty of time to work on that .
especially if we don 't get thrown back into jail the second we walk out this door .
[ chuckles ] [ sigh ] ah , cheers .
i get the big office .
fuck that .
i built that place from the ground up .
the big office is mine .
actually , it 's mine .
a sales contract ?
you bought the dealership ?
bullshit .
where 'd you get the scratch to outbid us ?
with the money i siphoned from the ruptals ' bank accounts .
those oblivious idiots .
an unfinished contract means nada , dot .
only one signature .
well ... i still have elaine 's shares which makes us all partners .
fuck .
holy coincidence , or what !
oh ...
rest in peace , my ruptal brother .
larry , tell me you 've been keeping up our insurance premiums .
you know it , buddy .
with that money , we can build a place twice this size .
yeah ...
once again , everything works out for good old fitzy .
ring a ding ding .
rat bastard .
motherfucker .
burn , baby , burn .
yeah .
um ...
you love when i take the whole thing in my mouth .
don 't you ?
00 : 17 : 04,600 -- 00 : 17 : 06,100 i 'm gonna cum for you , actually .
00 : 17 : 09,700 -- 00 : 17 : 10,700 i 'm cumming in your mouth .
hey ...
i just finished decorating my tree ...
what do you think ?
think it looks really pretty and it matches my pretty outfit that i dressed up for you .
my boobs look really good ...
nice and big ...
do you like these gloves ?
i think they 're really sexy .
also , i have a little surprise just for you .
see ?
i 'm wearing no underwear .
i think it looks really sexy with this skirt .
do you like to watch them bouncing up and down ?
so , let 's see what santa got me for christmas .
look what i got : ...
cute little pink toy to match my outfit .
do you want to watch me play with it ?
get it all wet .
i love spitting on it .
do you like watching me play with myself ?
oh ...
yeah .
oh , my god .
um ...
tastes so good ;
i wish you could taste it .
do you want me to turn it on for you ?
hope you guys enjoyed that and happy holidays .
that 's me .
jane quimby .
my life is a little complicated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chandler murray .
the only problem , they think i 'm an adult .
now i am juggling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she 's a little shady .
i 'm afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you 're happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fellas .
here 's how it 's going down .
are you robbing this place , tommy ?
let 's go !
let 's go !
a couple months at new hall youth detention might give mr. nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , janey .
it 's not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don 't .
i can 't talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i 'm just gonna say it .
it 's you , janey .
jane .
jane !
let 's go .
you 're gonna be late for school again , truant .
that guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
ben .
it 's a little weird that you call your girlfriend " miss shaw . "
oh , you mean rita .
hey .
are you really that busy ?
yes .
and no .
i 'm nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy 's different ?
what if he doesn 't want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juvenile detention center , not a brainwashing camp .
you 'll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i 'm waiting .
bated breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , " it 's you . "
- it 's you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn 't know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it 's been playing on a loop in my head .
" it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . " what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically ?
no .
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don 't think that 's it .
but i guess it can be .
i don 't know .
maybe it is .
i don 't know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he 's my best friend and i don 't want to run the risk of ruining that , right ?
- i can 't answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
jane by design 1x11
- the replacement original air date june 5 , 2012
that 's it ?
yeah , i mean , i don 't know what else to say .
it was pretty uneventful .
you were in a juvenile detention center .
so ?
so , was it scary ?
were the guards mean ?
did you make any friends ?
how was the food ?
did you ...
jane . look .
i wasn 't in alcatraz or anything , okay ?
i just ...
i 'd rather talk about something else , okay ?
okay .
maybe we should talk about , you know ...
yeah , you !
so , what about you ?
what 's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since i 've been away ?
oh . nothing , really .
- how 's jeremy ?
- jeremy ?
yeah , you guys are together , right ?
no .
we 've never been together .
he doesn 't even know that i 'm in high school .
and we work together .
i could never do that .
speaking of work .
how is it ?
well , things have been crazy ever since india got fired .
gray has been using me for everything .
it 's nuts .
and she 's been through at least a dozen people to fill india 's job .
wow .
that 's a lot of people .
tell me about it .
and you should see the stuff that she 's having me do .
i can 't even believe it .
i mean , don 't get me wrong ,
i love being creatively involved at donovan decker ...
you okay ?
let 's just say to be back here again .
and this place same way about me .
don 't worry about them .
and , billy ...
yeah ?
are we okay ?
shouldn 't we , talk or something ?
you 've been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car , jane .
right .
i mean , about ...
we 're good .
yeah .
there 's nothing for us to talk about , okay ?
unless you want to talk about that .
you have got to be kidding me .
yep .
lulu and nick .
they 've been an item ever since you left school .
looks like it 's just back to being the two of us .
yeah .
the two of us .
jane , i have to be honest .
i 'm a little disappointed .
disappointed ?
i 'm just surprised .
that 's all .
this progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the jane quimby that i know .
your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics .
well , that 's good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceramics .
- ouch .
and it 's not just your grades .
your attendance last month ?
let 's just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
this internship is interfering with your life .
your grades aren 't what they used to be , you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can 't happen .
i know , i know .
but i 'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i 'm already here .
this is my life .
it 's just an internship , jane .
it 's not .
i 'm working with designers and i 'm being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can 't learn in a classroom .
i 'm living it every day .
you can 't buy that kind of experience , you know ?
fine .
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn 't improve , i can 't sign off on the internship program for you next semester .
especially if you 're not ...
wait .
are you texting someone right now ?
uh , what ?
no .
i am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school .
stat .
i promise i 'll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
sorry .
i know this might sound harsh , but you 've been an incredible disappointment , sally .
it 's suzy .
your work has been lackluster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at donovan decker , you 've yet to show any real promise .
but i 've only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i 'm afraid .
you 're fired .
that 'll be all .
what ?
that 's five this month , gray .
well , it 's been harder to replace india than i might 've realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i 'm not worried .
i have a new prospect in mind .
someone young and unexpected .
someone not boxed in by years of design experience .
you don 't mean ...
you 're not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next appointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
martyn !
gray , darling !
so . classic .
clean .
powerful .
it 's a whole new delicious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i 'm afraid i don 't .
i love it .
you 're a genius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hats does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that 's twice as busy since india left ?
i think we 're all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
'cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , " over whom ? " and , " in pumps or flats ? "
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don 't get your hopes up .
hey .
what can i do for you , muffin ?
that 's a " no " on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn 't quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we 're on the same page .
so , what 's up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i 'm just a little concerned .
don 't worry .
she 's good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i 'm concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she 's falling behind .
i think this internship is just too demanding on her , don 't you ?
actually , i kind of think it 's been good .
but i promise i 'll make sure she stays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depends on it ?
bingo .
i know you 've all been working tremendously hard lately .
but you 're gonna have to work tremendously harder .
donovan decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world 's most famous luxury department stores ,
harrods .
that is , unless we blow it .
and we cannot blow it .
understood ?
okay .
didn 't i fire you ?
no .
oh .
see me in my office afterwards .
the style director assigned to oversee our harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one priority ?
carter ?
um , to impress the style director and ensure harrods is confident that donovan decker has what it takes ?
precisely .
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no exceptions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
now .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn 't see .
because apparently , we 're all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suzy ?
- right .
oh , my gosh .
i 'm turning into gray , aren 't i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i 'm going to tell you something and i need you not to react , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i 'm serious , jane .
okay .
gray is giving you india 's old job .
what ?
me ?
no reaction .
right .
take over india 's job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
janey ?
you ready ?
almost !
i 'll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind handing me the milk ?
yes .
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your toast is ready .
wait .
you 're actually considering this ?
no .
yes ?
i don 't know .
i mean , taking india 's old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime .
how could i say no ?
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you 'd really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
maybe .
why ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i 'm good .
oh , you 're good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
whatever .
- so , now you 're mad at me ?
yeah .
i am .
billy , you 've been shutting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won 't even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for starters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , janey .
nothing ?
that 's your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that 's it .
there 's nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i 'm different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it 's not for the better .
i didn 't ask you , jane .
fine !
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don 't know , ben .
maybe i took your advice and i tried to talk to him about the whole " it 's you " thing and maybe it backfired .
sorry about that .
i 'm worried about billy .
it can 't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don 't know , maybe an activity or something ?
like mathletes .
or chess club .
- i 'm being serious , rita .
- so am i .
come on .
chess ?
mathletes ?
what , do you want him to be more of an outcast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were adorable doing it .
shoot .
vice principal jenkins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what 're you naughty kids up to this fine morning ?
naughty ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said " mop " !
- and i 'll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jenkins .
good morning , rita .
and ...
ben .
that was close .
no .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what 's gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kidding ?
we ooze chemistry .
don 't say ooze .
hi .
hi .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bearings back .
- that 's good .
- yep .
so , what 's been going on with you ?
sorry .
stupid question .
so , you and fadden , huh ?
how 's that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you 're precipitating .
- excuse me ?
- your calcium is starting to form a precipitate .
you should dry out the crystals .
oh .
um ...
thanks .
- busy , huh ?
- mmm-hmm .
you 're not gonna cut me any slack here , are you ?
maybe .
but just a little .
okay .
i guess i deserve that .
i 'm really sorry , jane .
for what it 's worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it 's fine .
really , i 'm just distracted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and lulu seem very happy .
yeah .
the thing is ...
i ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
oh .
yeah .
thanks .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
thanks .
first day back .
how 're you doing ?
i 'm fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i 'm adjusting .
no , i just thought now that you 're back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive outlet .
for what ?
i don 't know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
such as ...
how about football ?
seriously ?
yeah .
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you 're a little stringy , but you 're probably very elusive .
hard to tackle .
baseball ?
oh , my .
are you kidding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you 're trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not really the team sport type .
are you sure you 're doing okay ?
i 'm fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i 'd like to .
- i 'd prefer if we didn 't .
excuse me .
coming through .
i have to leave school because of an emergency at work and rita can 't know under any circumstances because then i would lose my internship and that can 't happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don 't think so .
- no way .
what ?
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don 't really like to do this sort of thing , but can 't you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cramps , anything .
i don 't like lying to rita .
it 's just a teeny-tiny little white lie .
and that 's how it all starts .
that 's correct .
fine .
i don 't need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
oops .
sorry .
sorry .
that 's okay .
hey , i 'm actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you delivering those to ?
you think i 'm a flower delivery guy ?
i did .
a second ago .
but now i 'm a little unsure .
they 're for gray chandler murray .
oh . great .
i 'm gray 's assistant .
jane .
so i can just take those to her .
i 'd rather give them to her myself if that 's okay .
the thing is gray 's not exactly the hand delivery type .
what type is she ?
she 's more of a " don 't bother me with that kind of crap " type .
so , if you 're not the flower delivery guy , who are you ?
eli .
i have an appointment with gray .
today ?
no , it 's tomorrow .
i just thought i 'd get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn 't laugh .
well , it wasn 't laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn 't have any appointments today .
well , she called me directly .
gray ?
called you ?
on the phone ?
yeah .
crazy , right ?
so , what is this appointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you 're interviewing for it ?
yeah .
are you gonna point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gosh .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
tips ?
yeah , you know , like advice for the interview .
oh , um , just don 't take anything gray says to you personally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you 're saying she 's mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she 's just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you 're here !
oh !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven 't seen you in a while .
and i know lilies are your favorite .
jane , i see you 've met my nephew , eli .
yeah , we ...
nephew ?
yeah .
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you 're warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
nephew ?
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don 't like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray 's nephew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india 's new replacement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
no .
i ...
spit it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india 's job .
you are .
where 's jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her departure .
what 'd she say ?
she said some things about cramps .
cramps .
cramps . you know , lady stuff .
i 'm not that familiar with lady stuff , so i 'd really rather not discuss it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she 'll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mmm-hmm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-caff latte .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reservation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were booked up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some strings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what 's this ?
- some sketches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the accessories line .
i 'll take a look .
impressive .
you 're still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that 's nice .
hey .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
technically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there 's no such thing .
okay , come on , i 'm serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quimby .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it 's a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i 'm an assistant .
and the closest i 've come to studying design is , i don 't know , the endless hours i spent and fashion magazines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more qualified and he 's ...
he 's nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you 've got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
thank you .
i just really don 't know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insane ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he 's back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn 't he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we 've talked about this .
you 're my mentor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to rub it in .
all i 'm saying is i don 't know if it 's the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i 'm not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it 's nothing .
sorry .
thank you .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're welcome .
sup ?
wow !
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what 's going on with you ?
i was parched .
you 're avoiding me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm trying to keep things discreet .
between us .
you know ?
you 're lying to me about jane .
what ?
no .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cramps .
did not .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you 've got me really worried about these cold cramps .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going with you .
and if jane isn 't home sick in bed , that internship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
now !
- what happened ?
the collective brain power of you and me .
that 's what happened .
you said cramps , didn 't you ?
there 's no time for blame .
yes . i said cramps .
you just couldn 't stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she 's coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can 't you just call her ?
i 've called her like a dozen times .
it keeps going to voicemail .
ben , it 's just the whole racing to save jane thing , it 's not really my problem anymore .
look .
i 'm not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us .
otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she 's my sister .
i can 't bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can 't compete with this guy .
trust me .
she 's not going to hire her nephew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn 't go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn 't exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at donovan decker .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you 're already selling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i 'm just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materials , but i love it .
and that 's what it 's all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he 's perfect .
he 's charming and talented and good-looking
he 's not that good-looking .
i 'm serious , jeremy .
there 's no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i 'm up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it 's a courtesy , jane .
a family obligation .
this is gray we 're talking about .
she 's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i 'm always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we 're going .
understood ?
understood .
and if i find out you are lying , we 're gonna have a serious issue .
i 'm pleased to announce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by india jourdain .
- it 's you .
- what ?
i 'm certain of it .
this person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style .
this person is destined to be a rising star here at donovan decker .
this person is ...
wait !
what , jane ?
i 'm sorry .
i just ...
i can 't .
can 't ?
i can 't do this .
i 'd like to take myself out of the running .
i 'm so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don 't think i 'm ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i 'm pleased to introduce our newest designer ,
eli chandler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cramps , didn 't he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn 't think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed .
what do you think 's faster right now ?
5th or lex ?
we 're gonna have to ...
you came for me .
i did .
and i 'm not gonna let that be for nothing .
come on .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i 'm on my way to the house .
i 've stalled as long as i can and i just can 't keep lying to rita .
your chariot awaits .
mmm-hmm .
drive .
now .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a shortcut .
- oh !
come on , janey !
oh , wait .
pajamas !
jane ?
jane ?
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i 'm feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cramps .
so i just needed to ...
double whammy .
hmm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i 'm sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole manhunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for questioning you , accusing you of lying .
i don 't know what got into me .
i think you 're just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors , that 's all .
thank you .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gosh .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn 't even being offered ?
so embarrassing .
it wasn 't so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad .
i counted eight people cringing .
did you count me ?
okay .
nine .
i know you wanted that job .
honestly , i wasn 't ready to leave being a teenager behind just yet .
and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you 'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , " it 's you , "
and i need to know if you meant ...
i meant
that it 's you , janey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don 't want that to ever change .
because that 's what 's most important , right ?
yeah .
it is .
remember .
we must impress this harrods style director at any cost .
donovan is depending on us .
hello , losers .
that 's right .
i 'm the one you 've been waiting for .
where 's jane ?
i can 't wait to catch up .

i 'm the man whose money you took . he 'll get done , sooner or later . i made a call .
the vat man .
well done on bringing us the money . welcome to morocco .
help ! help ! for your own sake , i suggest you answer these questions truthfully .
why are you on this boat ?
that 's ... er ... that 's all of us going on a fishing trip .
i remember that day ... happy times .
you are putting a bag in the car . what was it ?
probably fishing gear .
bax ?
quinn ?
tell me about this , please .
where did you learn how to do this ?
what is happening here ?
that 's ... that 's just lads on holiday , innit ?
you know , things get a bit out of control .
hello ?
who 's there ?
hello ?
who are you ?
where are my friends ?
you all ok ?
they ... shaved me . and they bust my new glasses .
where are we ?
said morocco , didn 't they ?
yeah , i know that . but where ?
did they show you the pictures ?
what pictures ?
what do you say to ' em rick ? nothing .
obviously . don 't tell them anything , all right .
not until we get some kind of legal representation . someone from the embassy - amnesty or someone . how you gonna get in touch with them ?
who are they anyway ?
they 're some kind of militia or something , aren 't they ?
they knew we had that money . they picked us off . they 're probably using the money for some extremist movement .
he was wearing a shirt , with a marks and spencer 's label on . i saw it sticking out .
who ? my interrogator . i mean , extremists ...
they might .
shall we go and help him ?
best not to get involved .
you all right , mate ?
it 's a woman . serious . it 's a bird !
argh ! i was just trying to see if you were ok . i 'm quinn .
what sort of fag name is that ?
dunno . ask my dad . named after my grandfather , i think .
i 'm mercedes . hi .
- your dad into cars then ?
- heard of the count of monte cristo , dumb fuck ?
yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , i dunno , i can 't remember .
can i just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
it 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want . who are they ?
a bunch of cocksuckers ! come on ! do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the british government ?
yeah , it 's easy . they 're in there . eh ?
what ?
it 's the foreign office . sorry . what is this place exactly ?
it 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
a week ago , i was standing in line , holding a tuna baguette , queuing up for easyjet . now i 'm being fucking renditioned !
" dear god , please help me see danger coming my way , " and forgive the body count i will be sending your way . "
" never pick up a dead man 's gun . " " i ... .. " heart ...
right . we should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here . there 's laws and protocols ...
you think they 'll care about that ? they still have to abide by them .
woody , this is our government . governments can 't just hold us indefinitely for no reason . what you on about ?
course they can ! they do it all the time . you remember those plane spotters in greece ?
they said they were spies . and what about guantanamo ?
nobody even knew who was in there . get off ! come on !
all right ?
how did you end up here then , love ?
i was in kabul , " love . "
you in the army then ?
no , i went there because i like the opera .
didn 't like what i saw , so i went awol . took a long fucking walk . posted some things on the web .
secrets ? there are no secrets . only hidden truths .
how long do they usually keep people in here for ? as long as they want . that 's the point .
fellas , can i ... have a word ? in private .
this could be a trick . she could be working for them .
you not seen her face ?
what , you not talking to me now ?
i ain 't the enemy . anyway , if i wanted info out of you , i 'd just .... .. beat it out of you .
ever had a cauliflower ear , quinn ? or a wet willy ?
you know what churchill said ?
fuck off !
" if you 're going through hell , keep going . "
tough it out , guys ! you can get through this . you got each other for a start .
put our time to good use . only trying to help , knobhead . well , you 're not .
so , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , quinn ?
i don 't think anything , bax . because i 'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the sahara fucking desert . and why am i here ?
because you persuaded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh . " i persuaded you ? you called me .
i 've never called you , baxter . i 've never called you because i cannot bear your incessant moaning and complaining . oh , right , great - thanks .
yup . here we go . here we go .
nice toughing it out guys .
oi , quinnbo , you know there 's no " i " in team , don 't you ? no . but there 's a " u " in " fuck you . "
what 's going on ?
stop it ! get off ! get off me !
help ! get off ! what 's happening ?
please , don 't . let go ! where are you taking him ?
leave him alone ! bax ! get your hands off him , you slags !
i watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out . yeah , me too .
shit , no ... come on . let 's not think the worst .
hiya . i think there 's more grub on the side . just help yourself .
we 've been worried sick . you 've been gone all night . what happened ?
i dunno ... weird . they asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and toast .
you should get some . come , please . oi !
sit .
fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
all we wanted to know was who you were financing . we weren 't financing anyone .
we were just trying to get home . with five million euros ?
we have at our disposal dna databases , forensic analysis , satellite imaging technology . if that doesn 't give us what we need , we employ enhanced interrogation techniques .
if we want to find out the truth , we do . and now , we have .
we made a mistake . it happens . so ...
just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
hang on . does that mean that we can ... ? please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?
little candle-lit vigil ?
coloured rubber wrist bands - " free mercedes . "
take care .
mrs peters . 101 bridge road , crawley . it 's my mum . just let her know i 'm all right .
you take care of yourself .
seriously ?
did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
two nights in . nah ... thought that was it .
what went through your mind ?
well , first of all , my kids ... carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ... i thought i 'd never get to see united play again .
i kept thinking of my kids . kept seeing their little faces . then i thought about nina ....
i wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what i 'm like . be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your porno collection . nah , i don 't know .
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to spain and actually ending up in morocco .
if anyone so much as mentions " bad luck , " they 're walking . be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour . haven 't seen so much as a camel .
he 's gone .
he 's not coming back , is he ?
two stay , two go and get help . shouldn 't we all go ? why ?
or stay ? we 'll double our chances if we split . halve them you mean .
i do . i do . i do .
i 'll go . come on . you two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
do you believe in destiny , bax ? no .
so shut up .
fate then ?
rick , please . no destiny , no fate , no karma , no spells , no curses .
this is just a series of misunderstandings , ok ?
could have happened to anybody . no more , no less .
who 's ... ?
come on !
get in . you are about to be shot , get in !
bax , get in .
woods ! quinn ! hey !
- we had some disturbing intel . - well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
i 'd like to know what 's going on , please . a covert department of the cia , the special activities division has activated a kill contract on you . sorry ?
what are you talking about ? evidently , you 've intersected a line of narco-finance and ... wait .
your man in majorca ... .. has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the american security services . what ?
he 's paying the cia to protect him ?
narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for american black ops . - like a five-year-old , please .
not really new news . why would they want to kill us ?
one of you tipped off the authorities in the uk . a contact inside customs and excise .
your man here retaliated by telling the special activities division you were about to blow their op wide open . so now they have to take you out . no , this ... this is crazy .
this goes higher than us . this kind of thing brings down governments . iran contra anyone ?
which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation . they can 't just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together . under the aegis of " the global war on terror , " they can shoot anyone they like .
the cia ? no .
they 'd have tasked local contractors . so nothing can be linked back to them . you got lucky ...
but this isn 't going to go away . ok , let 's get practical , then . so what are the options ?
well , there must be something ?
right ... right - there may be a solution but we have to act now . like , this minute .
then i 'm afraid you 're on your own . how long would this be for ?
maybe for ever .
- we can never go home ?
- it 's the only offer on the table .
no , no , no , that 's ... that 's not an option .
no . i 'm going home and ... if you go back , you 'll be putting your families at risk as well .
ok , let me just see if this is even logistically possible .
stand up . get up .
we can do it . we have a scrambled phone link . you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circumstances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
amy ... yeah , i know , i 'm sorry that i haven 't rung .
listen to me for a second , love . nina ... just stop , just let me talk , darling , ok ?
right ... there 's no easy way of saying this , ok , so i 'm just going to say it straight out . i 'm not coming back .
if i 've only got one call , which one do i call ? you can 't make me choose . i need you to phone my folks ,
where are they ?
shit ... i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much ... i don 't know how long .
.. because that is not what 's happened . i 've met someone .
oh , amy ... please , just tell the kids , ok , that it 's not because of them , i 'm sorry nina .
no , no , everything 's fine . it 's just ... i think i 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
what ?
well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
i can 't hear you rachel , say that again .
take care ?
yeah , ok . i will . you too .
fuck ... no , no , you 're right , i 'm sorry , i know i shouldn 't swear . dad , listen to me , ok ?
you 've been brilliant , dad .
yeah , just take care . yeah ... i love you , dad .
i know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ? you think it 's my fault because i phoned the vat man .
it 's nobody 's fault , rick . it 's just ... i don 't know , the universe conspiring against us or something .
a fly saved my life . what ?
out in the desert . if it hadn 't been for that fly , i 'd have had my head blown off . and the weird thing was , we 'd met before .
any idea where we 're going yet ?
is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
bax ?
what you going to call yourself ?
what do you mean ?
your name .
we can 't use our own names right ?
hey ... i 'm gonna be floyd . that 's what i 'm gonna call myself .
you can 't call yourself that . why ?
it 's a black name . is it ?
it 's like calling yourself ... everton or tyrell , or something . you can 't .
tony smith . my name 's tony ... smith .
why can 't i be tony smith ? you call yourself whatever you like , mate . sir tony smith if you want , mate .
if i was a girl , i 'd call myself ... .. well , hope . you could be bob hope . new hope .

how dare you , and how dare you try and blackmail me !
help !
previously on siberia ... ( indistinct shouting )
a tiger !
a fucking tiger !
i couldn 't believe it .
it was like something a seven year old would tell me ...
" oh , i saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- what are you doing ?
- wondering what would do that to a tiger .
oh , hell .
it 's on fire ...
and it 's green ...
- what 's on fire ?
- the sky .
you know , there 's something about carolina .
i feel like i recognize her .
- fire in the woods , man .
- ( man ) got to get some water .
i told you this was a mistake !
that 's all we had , man .
that 's all we had .
does anyone recognize this ?
we found johnny 's shirt .
and it was full of food from the shed .
( johnny ) i get what it looks like .
i see that .
but i didn 't steal the food , and i didn 't burn down the shed .
someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
people weren 't taking too kindly me being at camp ' cause apparently i stole food from the shed and then burned it down .
someone framed me .
they wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
i don 't know who did it .
you know , frankly , i don 't really care anymore , you know ?
i don 't really need them anyways .
you know , obviously , i can take care of myself .
took them how long to build a fire ?
i did it in five minutes in the dark .
( daniel ) i can 't believe
johnny 's gonna just stay out in the woods .
that 's crazy .
and why shouldn 't he ?
after all the crap that he 's pulled ?
he 'll be fine .
and if he 's not , you got a better chance of winning .
and you can keep his bed .
i want to make it to the end , but i want to do it as a team , kind of like how neeko 's doing it , you know ?
can i tell you something ?
( daniel ) sure .
you 're a smart guy .
you know that neeko is a professional athlete ?
he plays game for living .
how about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trusts him , just to win the game ?
have you ever thought about it ?
i don 't think you should trust him .
( sam ) can 't trust anybody .
guys ?
i get up early , and as soon as i open the door , i practically ran into this spear that 's stuck in the ground .
it felt like a threat .
let me see .
( woman ) what does it say ?
it says ... ( speaks russian )
( woman ) what is that ?
it means " get out . "
it 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
it 's a nice prop .
look at it .
it 's not real .
nice scare tactic .
they 're watching .
i 'm sure they 're loving this .
( woman ) why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
who wants you guys to get out ?
( man ) well , this is here on purpose .
that 's for sure .
it 's here on purpose .
it 's here for a reason .
you guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this , really ?
( daniel ) who else could 've left that spear ?
besides production , who could 've done it ?
we 're the only people out here .
aren 't we ?
♪
- are you okay ?
- i 'm fine .
i mean , aren 't you still scared ?
the spear this morning telling us to leave ?
that doesn 't scare you at all ?
i think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
i miss home .
i miss my family .
i even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend .
this place is-- it 's getting to me .
i don 't know .
i 'm thinking about pushing the button .
i don 't want you to go .
you know what i mean ?
i think-- i think we can win this .
we just need to--
but i don 't need to stay .
i don 't understand why i 'm even staying .
i don 't need the money that badly .
i do .
annie .
( sam ) i 've been a lone wolf for a while , you know ?
i 've been on my own for a while .
i 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than i have been in a long time because i 'm interacting with people more often than i have in many years .
now i consider daniel a friend .
he 's a good kid .
if i had a son , i 'd be proud if he was like daniel .
what are you looking at ?
- just watching those two .
- mm-hmm .
( daniel ) i don 't want to overstep my bounds , you know .
i don 't know how she feels about me , and so i 'm just kind of--
i 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard ' cause i really want to , you know , see where this is gonna go .
i don 't know .
at the same time , i don 't want to get hurt .
don 't worry .
she knows you exist .
how would i really get her to ?
i don 't know , like ...
get her to what ?
like me like me .
you can 't get her to like you .
either she does or she doesn 't .
you know ?
( laughs )
how beautiful is it ?
this is so nice .
_
why not ?
_
( laughs )
i 'm sorry .
i 'm being naughty .
it 's beautiful in , though .
_
you must be hot .
come on .
_
- no good ... _
- no one 's here .
- it 's trouble .
no one 's here .
i 'm not gonna tell anyone .
you want to come .
- oh , yeah ?
_
you 'll thank me once you 're in here .
it 's beautiful .
_
careful .
_
i 'm gonna film us .
_
( laughs ) it 's a great idea .
( laughs )
you promise you 'll erase it ?
_
- promise me ?
- i promise .
good .
annie ?
wait , annie .
you shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
it 's not safe .
_
what are you talking about ?
come on , it 's not safe .
stop . wait .
don 't be like this .
be like what ?
look , i-- ( sighs )
it 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
i 'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend , and i get that you 're sad about that .
but you 're forgetting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
no , i 'm not .
( annie ) i like her .
it 's been a while since i 've been with anybody , but i--
we get along so well .
i just feel like a dumbass now .
i mean , she 's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- hey .
- ( irene ) hey .
- there you are .
- ( irene ) how 's it going ?
good .
i just wanted to talk to you .
uh-huh ?
um , so , victoria 's gone .
um , i 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
oh , it 's-- well , it 's free right now .
so no one would mind if i moved in ?
um ... yeah , yeah .
i mean , i don 't mind .
i don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
( esther ) awesome .
all right , i 'll go grab my things .
it 's not that i didn 't have fun with the boys .
i don 't know .
i just feel like my time there is done .
it 's served its purpose , and i want to--
i want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- ( miljan ) hey .
- hey .
- ( miljan ) what are you doing ?
- i 'm leaving .
you mean the show ?
( esther ) ( laughs ) no , you idiot .
i 'm gonna move into victoria 's old bed .
wait .
why ?
why ?
because it 's free .
( miljan ) i know , but i thought you liked it here with me .
you said we are great roommates .
yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
just , i don 't know .
i want to be with the girls now .
come on , esther .
don 't you think we should team up ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
we are both smarter than everyone else here .
we can win this thing-- together .
ohh , i like your style .
i will think about it .
but hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
i was just thinking that we could have something ... ( esther ) you thought what ?
that we could get romantic a little bit ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
( miljan ) don 't laugh .
really ?
i don 't do romance .
look , we 're playing a game .
( miljan ) what do you mean ?
( esther ) i 'm playing a game-- for money .
i don 't do romance , and i 'm not playing a dating game .
i 'm sorry .
fuck you , bitch !
fuck you , bitch !
you 're not going anywhere .
get the fuck off me !
( miljan ) i 'm kidding .
( laughing ) i was just kidding , esther .
i 'm just kidding .
esther .
( esther ) don 't you fucking touch me again .
( miljan ) come on ! i 'm just-
- i was just kidding !
( esther ) i think i was in shock .
i-i don 't know .
it happened so quickly .
but he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bunk , and then he backed off .
( miljan ) esther is a player .
we all know that .
and i played with her , too .
so she was on the way out .
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jokingly , like pretending that i 'm like scaring her .
" you 're gonna stay here , " or something .
she just , like , freaked out .
she pushed me away .
she 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
stormed out , like mad .
and i was just telling her , " i 'm joking .
you know me . i always joke around .
i was just joking with you . "
i didn 't get it , seriously .
she just freaked out , and it was just a pure joke .
what are you showing me ?
it was right here .
( carolina ) are you sure ?
( neeko ) big huge carcass .
guts hanging out and everything .
look .
look at what ?
the blood ?
it could 've been anything .
it could 've been a bird . it could 've been a deer .
( neeko ) why would i make this up ?
why would i lie ?
there was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there .
i guess they took it .
the producers took it .
