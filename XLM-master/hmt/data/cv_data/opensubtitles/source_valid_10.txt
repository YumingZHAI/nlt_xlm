i understand .
let 's do that .
you ... you 're really capable , i guess . i don 't know why , but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind .
the charges are dropped , and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened .
ah , yes , i 'm really sorry to bother you for this .
sometime soon , i 'll arrange a meeting .
let 's have dinner together .
ah , yes ... yes , then ...
let me ask you just one thing .
what is the reason you tried to protect that bastard ?
please let me tell you once again .
what i want to protect is only the drama " morning of kyeongseong , " which i 'm in charge of as director of drama department . and also , your interruption in my drama by using that dirty trick , i hope that never happens again from now on .
fine .
but you should know this one thing at least . that dirty trick you 're talking about , you also had benefits from it .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of faction or connections ?
what ... what are you talking about ?
that 's right .
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you despise so much !
anthony is released ?
what are you saying ?
!
i heard that the case is closed now .
i think that chairman ordered to drop the charges .
the chairman ?
it 's me , mr. chairman .
i don 't know what to say to express my gratitude .
you 'd better thank director nam woon hyeong .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of faction or connections ?
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you despise so much !
what brings you here at this late hour , representative kim ?
i came to say thank you . well , i don 't know what you 've heard or where , but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but can i ask you how you resolved it ?
i don 't think i have to tell you about that .
yeah .
yes ?
yes , it 's me .
huh ?
mom ...
mom !
how did this happen ?
this afternoon , her condition suddely became critical .
but luckily , the critical moment is gone , and now she 's stable .
so , you don 't need to worry so much .
are you ok ?
i didn 't know your mother was still alive .
why did you say it like that before ?
that she had passed away .
i ... really hated them .
our extreme poverty , my father who abandoned me as soon as i was born , whose face i 've never seen , and even my mother who is blind .
i hated them all and was ashamed of them .
when i got to the usa , i made a resolution .
that i will forget everything that happened in korea . from now on , i 'm anthony , i don 't know anything about poverty , and i grew up in the states , i 'm anthony .
and that 's what i told everybody , too . that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance .
that i grew up with a happy childhood .
i 'm ... a big coward .
what 's the next scene ?
kim woo jin and jin hye rin 's kissing scene .
is it ?
and the actors ?
a kissing scene with that moron ?
just thinking about it makes me sick !
min ah , just close your eyes and get over with it , please ?
what else can we do at this point ?
hyung .
do you really have to go that far ?
affawhashiditamelashtime ?
( after what she did to me last time ?
)
afcarshahaftagothishfar .
( of course i have to go this far . )
afcarsh .
( of course . )
if you are ready , you may come out .
from now on , can you play the piano only for me ?
even if i were to betray you ?
even if i were to deceive you ?
could you still play it only for me ?
cut !
ah , min ah , what 's wrong ?
you were doing so well !
go brush your teeth before i throw a fit . [ dropping the honorifics ]
yes , noona .
i knew you 'd say that .
" is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for ? "
" of course , it 's my mom . mrs. park kang ja . "
of course , of course it 's your mom .
who else but your mom ?
by the way , mom ...
what is it ?
there is someone i know ... whose past is so full of pain that he can 't get over it ...
sure , there are people like that .
he wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she 's alive .
does that make him a bad person ?
of course that makes him a bad person .
then why the heck would someone not think of him as a bad person ?
well , that means that someone likes that person .
why ?
is this about you ?
no !
it 's for my drama .
so cold . aunty , i 've come for some grilled mackerels !
oh !
welcome !
and that 's what i told other people , too .
that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance . that i grew up with a happy childhood .
i 'm ... a big coward ...
what are you thinking about ?
i couldn 't reach you at all all day yesterday .
did something happen ?
nothing really .
you did that back then , too .
five years ago , when you broke up with me and left .
like yesterday , i couldn 't reach you at all all of a sudden . after transforming the rookie actress sung min ah into the goddess of melodramas , you deserted me , leaving as if you were running away .
i 've told you already .
i 've erased all my memories of you .
don 't lie .
though you may not have had started out that way , towards the end , you ended up loving me .
yes , i admit that i did like you .
then , why did you leave ?
you 're an actress who should be loved by everybody . if that 's the only reason , don 't leave me ever again .
episode 14 from dusk till dawn ready , action ! fire !
hye rin ! ahjussi , youcan 'tsleephere ! fire !

like people who were wishing that i wouldn 't get out .
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blowing in my direction , it 's killing my eyes .

where is the hospital ?
i have to go there as well .
the director said the actors and staff shouldn 't come .
and just stand by near here .
he will contact us .
what are you thinking about ?
the extra who died on my set on that day , 5 years ago ...
that day comes up again and again in my memory .
5 years earlier .
what do we do ?
!
you bastard !
bring my son back to life !
i 'm telling you to bring him back !
my precious son !

where are you going ?
for now , don 't look for me .
thenwhataboutmydrama ?

hm , mom .
did the staff like it ?
they all said it 's really delicious and complimented your cooking skills .
and were really grateful .
yes ? but why does your voice sound so frail ?
but why does your voice sound so frail ?
did something happen ?
no .
work is going well , so don 't worry too much .
don 't get too hung up on the script without sleping , and take it easy .
don 't overwork .
yes , i 'll do that .
hello !
go eun !
mom , i 'll give you a call later on .
kang hyun min .
i was worried ...
how is he ?
he just went into intensive care , we 're all waiting for him to wake up .
actually , i was surprised . i 'm sorry to you for thinking this way , but that you would come here yourself ,
i would never have imagined it .
it 's what i should do .
you must be tired , you can go and wash up .
you don 't have to worry because i 'm here .
writer !
it was my fault .
what ?
what does that ...
i ... saw him . no , no , no .
bit na ... she 's the lead actress , so i have to act with her .
how can we film seperately ?
anyways , i 'm a little busy so i 'll call you later .
i 'm hanging up .
what a scare !
ahjussi !
you can 't sleep here .
hey , bit na , if you 're going to be like this i 'm going to get mad !
got it ?
back then , if i ... had only woken him up ...
no ...
if i had called another person ... it wouldn 't have turned out like that .
don 't blame yourself too much .
you couldn 't have imagined the situation would be like this .
no one could .
even so ... if only i had given it a little thought this wouldn 't have happen .
aigoo .
i fully understand what you 're feeling .
don 't think about it this negatively .
because that man can get up again .
really ?
of course . everyone is praying single-heartedly , so it will turn out well .
so cheer up . kang hyun min style .
my style ?
korea 's top star kang hyun min , your highness ' style .
like brad pitt ?
yes , like brad pitt .
why did you come here ?
he said he came because he was worried .
how is he ?
externally he has minor burns , the problem are internal injuries of the lung .
fotunately the internal injuries are also minor .
go inside , have a look .
he regained consciousness a while ago .
are you feeling alright ?
thank you so much , representative .
if it wasn 't for you ...
i wouldn 't have remained alive .
get well fast .
once this drama is finished , you have to do the ninth drama with us as well .
then . i 'll have to get up fast .
min ah !
they said he 's conscious !
he woke up ?
yes , and there are no major injuries .
ah ... that such a relief .
i 'll be at the car .
take your time to get ready and come out .
okay , got it .
representative , no !
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blowing in my directions , it 's killing my eyes .
representative ! - ah , team leader .
you were looking for me ?
give him enough money for him to get proper treatment until he fully recovers .
yes .
also quickly prepare the compensation so he can receive it soon .
make sure it to be enough , not lacking .
yes , i got it . make sure it to be enough , not lacking .
what ?
ah , nothing .
representative , today ... you were totally cool .
representative , are you alright ?
shouldn 't you be examined as well ?
you don 't look good .
how can i look good ?
i went into a fire pit and came out .
i 'm okay , so don 't worry .
representative kim !
thank you .
now did those 5-year-old memories disperse a little ?
anthony .
you 're a pretty okay producer .
it took you this long to realize that ?
how disappointing .
right .
then i 'm sorry .
now you 'd better get back to the set and finish the shoot .
isn 't it the last scene ?
right .
please look after the situation over here .
hyun min , let 's go !
don 't we have to shoot the last scene ? of course we have to shoot it !
that little bastard kang hyun min has changed quite a lot .
he did , didn 't he ?
but it 's not as much as the change of " someone . "
what are you talking about ?
i 'm talking about " someone " who was the original cold-blooded asshole but now suddenly changed to a nice guy .
tell me .
why did you run into the fire ?
huh ?
everybody was at a loss , not knowing what to do , but why did you run into the fire despite its danger ?
i just went inside .
just like that ?
didn 't you say you sold your soul to the devil ?
kim bong dal .
the soul anthony sold - kim bong dal bought it back , cheaply .
so you have returned .
you as well .
cut !
okay !
we 're done for tonight !
well , today , you all did a great job .
tomorrow there is no shoot , so rest well .

0 !
- 0 .
- 7 ! - bang !
- aargh !
i got you !
would you like one ?
gwangsoo !
he 's sure having fun . but ...
i can take care of the actors .. but representative kim you have to take care of writer lee .
actually , among all , writer lee is the one who should take care of her health the most .
if you get sick , it will cause the blank of scripts right away .
well , we were going to leave the room soon , anyway .
what is this ?
what 's with this atmosphere , so awkwardly quiet ?
huh ?
should kang hyun min up the mood ?
what would be good ?
what about ya ja time ?
what a stupid game , ya ja time . anthony , be quiet . ( informally )
are we starting ?
huh ?
hyun min , you , stop acting up like that . ( informally )
hey , min ah , you think i 'll let you off easy because you 're the nuna ?
nuna ( an older sister ) my ass ...
how much longer are you going to pretend to be 27 ?
be honest .
you 're 31 .
how old are you ?
29 .
stop staring , dude .
okay okay ... let 's end it here .
young mok , you be quiet . the adults are talking .
please excuse me .
yes , you can speak now .
oh , representative kim .
the incident was taken care of ?
yes , thankfully everyone is safe and sound .
please tell that to the chief .
umm , that is ..
is something wrong ?
chief nam handed in his resignation .
what ?
his resignation ?
well , it hasn 't been processed yet .
we can talk details when you 're back in seoul .
oh really , then ... ah , it 's been a long time , this is great .
well , did you finish your business refreshingly ( at the restroom ) , director ?
now , i 'm not a director any longer . hey , stop talking formally .
we got hired at the same time .
geez . yes , i understood , director .
you ... come back again .
hey , i just submitted my resignation .
what are you talking about ?
the president hasn 't approved it yet .
you know what kind of a person deputy director kim is .
as soon as you you submitted your resignation , he 's already so busy to put his people in the important positions .
do you think that 's all ? all the dramas with great quality , which you gave the time slots , they are all cancelled now .
woon hyeong , i 'm begging you . to drama department , please come back .
let 's drink .
what are you thinking so hard about ?
no , it 's nothing .
by the way ...
why did you really run in ?
you were the kind of person who worked on the principle of certainty based on numbers .
i 'm just curious if you had such confidence when you ran into the fire .
seriously , why did you run in ?
someone pushed me from behind .
honestly , i don 't know either .
why i did that in that moment .
i want to know .
the more i know you , the better i want to get to know you .
i am brad pitt .
oh , bit na it 'll be hard to see you today . i 'll see you tomorrow , huh ?
that person who got hurt is fine now .
you have to throw a party for him too ?
even so a person i work with came back from the dead .
what am i supposed to do .
so ... now you 're saying that ajusshi is more important than i am ?
that 's not what i 'm saying .
you 're saying you can 't come because some nobody extra got hurt .
what ?
some nobody extra ?
what ?
am i wrong ?
how can you say something like that ?
so rudely ?
what ?
oppa , are you ... mad at me right now ?
be honest , right now you 're drinking and playing with that bitch sung min ah .
what-
fine !
i 'm playing with sung min ah .
i want to play with sung min ah . all night long !
oppa !
do you like that bitch ?
yes i love sung min ah , i love her very much , i love her so very much !
i love you so much sung min ah !
hanging up !
have you gone crazy ?
don 't take this wrong .
i might look crazy now , but ...
don 't come any closer !
that 's not it-
i said don 't come any closer !
no , i mean ...
you !
i 'm warning you .
find someone within your league .
- good morning !
- have you slept well ?
representative isn 't here ?
ah , he had to go to seoul .
ah ... riding on that food truck ?
yes .
i wonder if he 's doing ok with the trip .
oh , you 're here .
yes .
writer lee , let 's go together in my car .
yes .
it 's raining all of a sudden .
this is the first time i 've ridden in a car with a writer like this .
yes .
ah , you said before , that you and representative kim are like an angel and a demon .
ah , before ...
what happened so that he 's called as a demon-like bad producer ?
i 'm just curious if he was different ( to you ) from representative kim whom i know .
frankly speaking , i like representative kim .
no , i mean , two of us used to love each other , so we 're trying to work it out from now on .
i 'm hoping you , writer lee , can help our relationship .
you can tell represenative kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him .
all of you , aren 't you embarrassed to bring me this rating chart ?
cp choi of the daily drama .
yes , deputy director .
why do you think your rating is bad ?
why is such bad ratings happening ?
and , " children of paradise , " make it end within this month . it 's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better .
it 's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better .
quality , potential ... do you think such things will bring more advertisement ?
until when will you wait for the bit-by-bit increasing rating ?
the next drama after " children of paradise ... "
where is cp oh ?
oh , cp oh !
don 't make some trivial one , but something sensational , something stunning ! yes .
listen carefully !
i care about only rating .
rating , rating , rating !
do properly , please !
shall we buy a dog , too ?
no way . i really hate dogs .
- why not ?
we love dogs a lot .
- then , who will take care of it ?
you must be coming back from grocery shopping .
you should say hello . hello !
hello !
oh this kid .
you look a lot like your dad , huh ?
but , who are you ahjussi ?
ah , someone dad works with .
go in , first .
let 's go home .
goodbye .
i 'm sure you 've heard the news , and i have nothing to say to you .
please , just leave .
were you somebody who feels so little responsibility ?
what is your reason ? you tried hard to change all shady dirty tricks by even risking your director position , but now , what on earth is the reason you stepped down from that position ? well , i 'm sorry for not taking responsibility for " morning of kyeongseong " until the end , but i can 't tell you why .
please leave . until i hear that reason , i can 't leave . the director position i got was given not by my competence , but by that shady trick which i despised so much , and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ? and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ?
what do you mean ?
nam gook hyeon , chairman of empire group .
i got the position because of my father 's power .
maybe , that 's why i hated you more , representative kim .
to me , you seemed worse than my father .
i wanted to deny such father , so i have lived , thinking i don 't have a father .
i wanted to hide it until the end if i could .
well , then that 's enough for the reason , isn 't it ?
no .
if that is why ( you resigned ) , it can 't be a reason to me even more .
i also had a family whom i wanted to deny once .
but even so , i didn 't run away from the path i had to go .
you once told me that people like me should disappear from this field .
but in the end , i 'm still here , but you 're leaving .
before you leave , just keep this in your mind .
then , at the end , there will be only dirty people left with shady tricks .
now hyun min , pass the thugs sent by choi , look towards min ah .
hyun min 's face is full of surprise !
that 's right , that 's right !
good ! still in shock , hyun min 's line !
hyun min , what about your line ?
i 'm done with you !
have your way with the shooting snogging your oh-so-beloved sung min ah !
huh ?
um , isn 't she ... yoon bit na of the idol group angels ? yoon bit na of the idol group angels ?
( moron )
let 's take a break for 5 minutes .
yes .
- gwang soo . - yes , hyung .
why didn 't you block her ? even if i had blocked her , you 'd still have gotten slapped .
so unlucky !
to be honest , i like representative kim .
to be more specific , we used to be in love with each other .
and now , we 're trying to get back together .
i 'm hoping that you , writer lee , could help us with that .
once you get to know him , representative kim is quite a catch .
yes ?
where are you ?
why ?
what do you mean " why " ?
did you forget ?
what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
you said you were going to re-sign your contract .
that 's why you 're calling right now ?
is there anything to talk about besides that ?
looks lire you 're at your studio , so i 'll head that way .
no , don 't come .
what ?
i said don 't come , since i 'm going out now .
where are you going ?
do i have to report that to you too ?
mom !
you 're here !
he 's been waiting !
why are you so late ?
i heard that you 're going to sign a contract for 100 episodes .
he 's also promising a lot of money !
well , i 'll leave you two to talk .
i 'll run some errands next door .
how did you know to come here ?
besides the writer 's room , do you have anywhere else to go but here ?
okay , let 's make this contract , writer lee .
i 'll do it later .
what ?
did that ssd production company or whatever contact you again ?
pardon ?
how much ?
how much did they offer you ?
do you think i 'm doing this because of money ?
then what is it ?
don 't forget how much i had to suffer in that bitter cold because of you .
no ... i - i need to read and review the contract , don 't i ?
what now ?
you can 't take your word back , alright ?
alright , i got it !
lee go eun .
yes ?
don 't let me wait too long . hyung , hyung , hyung , hyung , wake up .
wake up !
what is it ?
[ kang hyun min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other ]
gwang soo , how did this happen ?
i guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have informed the reporters .
what day ?
the day when you got slapped by miss yoon bit na .
i 'm done with you now !
have it your way with the shooting snogging that oh-so-beloved sung min ah !
oh my mother , father ... unni , does this even make sense ?
min ah , you should calm down first . calm down , calm down .
i think kang hyun min released these articles on purpose .
he did it because i wasn 't accepting his heart .
would he go that far ?
of course !
a moron like him would easily do this !
unni , you have no idea how much he is into me right now .
really ?
that bad ?
what the heck is representative oh doing , letting these kind of reports get published ?
i know , right ?
really !
representative , miss sung min ah is in a scandal in the reports !
what ?
with whom ?
well , it 's ...
is it anthony ?
what the heck is this ? what the heck is this ?
the report on miss sung min ah 's scandal .
what the heck ?
since when did they get so close ?
no wonder ...
i knew it the moment yoon bit na of angels slapped him .
what ?
slapped him ?
what happened ?
come on , spill it !
we have no time to lose ! well , you should take a look at this .
[ kang hyun min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other according to a mik staff ]
representative , were you aware of it , too ?
what would you like to have ?
hot jamaican blue with extra shot .
espresso .
okay .
what the heck are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
i know very well that you released those reports !
what !
?
take those reports off while i 'm still being civil .
have you lost your mind ?
( informally )
what ! ?
what did you say just now ?
( informally )
you ?
yes , you !
listen carefully . i don 't know exactly how much you like me but i don 't have the slightest interest in you so direct your interest elsewhere and get rid of the articles instantly .
kang hyun min and sung min ah , you both look so great together .
i wish you to continue loving each other in a bashing manner , fighting .
why are you sitting here ?
oh my jesus .. oh my jesus ..
have you read that scandal news about kang hyun min and sung min ah ?
that 's very good .
pardon ?
people will now watch the drama with more interests .
it will help the rating , don 't you think so ?
" children of paradise , " i think i told you to end it earlier than its original plan . well , that 's ...
in case of " children of paradise , " both the production company and its actors are so determined to work for it until the end .
moreover , if it ends earlier , the next drama 's first airdate should be moved up , but its production company is complaining a lot because they 're not ready yet .
production company , production company , production company !
what can you do if you keep kissing the asses of production companies !
?
we , who are on top of the heads of such mere production companies , are the " a " ! " a " ! if we 're the " a , " then we should show what " a " is supposed to be !
yes , that 's right . scheduling the dramas is the own right of us , the broadcasting station , but at the same time , it 's the promise with viewers .
should we change that precious promise with viewers just because the rating is bad , or because its commercial value is bad or not , as if we turn our palm over ? well , as far as i know , you submitted your resignation and left our company , so do you think you have the right to come here ?
yes , i just met president .
as of 5 pm , today , i 'm approved to come back as director of drama department .
deputy director .
thank you for your work . first , for leaving my position because of my personal reason ,
i 'm sincerely sorry .
then , before starting the meeting , let me tell you one thing . that 's right , as our deputy director kim said , we 're the " a. "
but i would appreciate if you remember this point as well .
justice without power is really helpless and vain .
but power without justice is just violence .
now , the era of violence must be ended .
the era of violence must not be repeated .
well , then shall we begin the meeting ?
yes , speaking .
oh , representative kim .
i heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident . i heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident .
wouldn 't there be any problem for our air schedule ?
i don 't think it 's something a jobless person has to concern . listen well ,
i 'm talking to you now as director of drama department .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand , director . everything will go well without any issue .
okay , i will rely on you , representative kim .
i heard you 're reinstated .
yes .
as you see .
what is the reason you changed your mind ?
well , if you hear that , you will be disappointed .
well , there is nothing more to be disappointed about .
yes . this position , that 's right , not by my competence but by your power , father , by unjust method , it 's given to me .
even if i didn 't know that , it 's also my fault .
but , just quitting isn 't solving everything , and i should do my best in this very position to not let this drama field rot , to not let this drama go back to the past dirty way .
i thought that is very important .
well , times have changed , i guess .
i will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change .
representative ...
what ?
let 's think about warm things .
for me , it 's baked sweet potatoes .
the first thing coming in your mind is that cheap baked sweet potato ?
what 's wrong with baked sweet potatoes ?
if you 're not careful enough , your mouth will get burnt .
you have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot .
miss , would you like a sweet potato ?
no thank you , i 'm fine .
please keep selling many .
no . no , lee go eun .
don 't think useless thoughts .
concentrate on the script .
concentrate for the waiting viewers of your drama .
okay , you can do it ! aja aja ! lee go eun , fighting !
who is it ?
it 's me .
what are you doing , not opening the door ?
what 's the matter ?
have you made a decision ?
what decision ?
renewing the contract .
is that why you came ?
no .
because of this . no . because of this .
you said you wanted to eat roasted sweet potatoes .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes .
i remember .
don 't misunderstand .
i didn 't do this because of the contract renewal and i didn 't do it for some other ulterior motive either .
honestly , i just bought them when i saw the street vendor selling them nearby , so just enjoy .
eat it before it gets cold . i 'm leaving .
i don 't even believe in myself sometimes but i believe in you .
you 're not ... crying , right ?
no , the two of us , we used to love each other , and now , we 're thinking of working it out .
because of this .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes .
what ?
do they taste bad ?
why do you confuse people ?
what ?
you 're dating sung min ah , why are you being like this to me ?
dating sung min ah ?
who ?
what do you mean , " who " ?
you are .
why would that person give me sweet potatoes ?
who said i was dating sung min ah ?
eh ?
i don 't know where you heard that strange rumor no , i guess you 're saying that because you saw me with sung min ah here before .
i don 't have such feelings for whomever , so you don 't have to be concerned .
well , it 's not that i 'm concern about that but ...
that is ... and , if somebody buys you sweet potato , are you always confused ?
what are you confused about ?
no ...
well , this ... if this is from china or from domestic ... i was confused ...
that is ... do you by chance like me ?
then again , that would never happen .
representative .
what ?
episode 15 we have crossed the rubicon do you like me by any chance ? but then , there is no way you would .
representative . what ? n--no , it 's nothing .
so silly . right ! i like you !
i said i like you .
i must be crazy , i 'm crazy .
i 'm not in my right mind .
i like you !
i said i like you .
hyung , what are you waiting for ?
just tell her like a man !
easier said than done .
i just can 't work up the courage .
that 's why you need to get brave .
just make up your mind and walk up to her ...
walk up to what ?
you have arrived .
pd joo , what is it ?
something wrong ?
no , nothing .
actually , joo pd ...
spill it , goo hee jae .
what is it ? pd joo fell in love .
what ?
love ?
yes . the moment he saw the youngest fd of the directing team , he fell for her .
joo pd .
yes .
are you in your right mind ?
eh ?
do you think i pay you just so you could chase chicks at the filming site ?
what kind of a production pd doesn 't separate his private life from his work ?
tell me .
are you really dating kang hyun min ?
i don 't know about it .
if you really want to know , you could go ask that moron yourself .
i need to go for more shooting . min ah , either anthony or kang hyun min , the way i see it , your taste in men is really low .
what ?
you know it . our hyun min is so gentle and considerate , which could cause such rumors with miss sung min ah , but ... hyung , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
representative choi ! red long johns , red pants !
what 'cha doin ' ?
- just shut up already !
ah , at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
yes , then , i 'm hanging up .
i was just explaining to the reporter about your rumor !
ah , you were being interviewed ?
yes . you should have said so then .
hyung !
how can you hang up so rudely when it was such an important call ?
they 're only going to get more suspicious !
what exactly do you do for me as my representative ?
do you even know that my korean beef endorsement contract is about to expire ?
don 't worry , they 're coming this afternoon .
really ?
i 'm warning you .
stop staring at me .
i 'm out of your league , so give up and just concentrate on your drama .
ah well , with your unrequited love and endorsements ... you 're busider than a bee , no wonder you 'd forget about the drama .
what ?
unrequited love ?
busier than a bee ?
hyung !
is there a bee farm around here ?
why did it fail ?
hey ! isn 't " morning in kyeongseong " a total hit ?
i know !
hyun min oppa is so amazing in that one !
but , i 'm not sure about the recent episodes .
why ?
think about it . jin hye rin told kim woo jin that she loves him and whatever .
they even kissed !
and now she 's going to betray him ?
what 's up with that ?
that 's true .
that doesn 't make sense .
roasted sweet potatoes , chips , ramyun ...
such a childish appetite you have .
don 't you care about staying in shape ?
are you listening to me ?
yes .
your mother is at your studio , so get going .
mom ?
it 's delicious .
aigoo , it already started !
you 're watching it again ?
of course ! i 'm watching all the reruns , too .
is it that fun ?
of course .
whose daughter wrote it , after all ?
gosh , why is he like that again ?
go eun ... that jin hye rin , is she betraying kim woo jin after all ?
no .
actually , this will be revealed much later , but she 's not really betraying him .
she 's pretending to betray him because there 's no other way , but she 's really helping kim woo jin .
oh , it was like that ?
had i known that , i wouldn 't have been cursing her .
my daughter is amazing !
you are a genius , genius !
it 's starting .
now , let 's hear from mr. kang hyun min 's management staff . as you know , our hyun min is so gentle and considerate , that it causes such misunderstandings ... but at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
why , what are you doing ?
representative choi ! - just shut up already !
your voice came out also .
how embarrassing ...
like this , the management is denying the rumor , but reports of witnesses who saw the two actors dating at a cafe or at the filming studio keep surfacing , prompting the possibility of another celebrity couple being in the making , which is a hot potato in the world of entertainment gossip currently .
ah , seriously !
celebrity couple in the making ?
i told them no ! why don 't they believe me ?
! that 's why you should have been more firm !
my cf , my money is here !
i 've been really enjoying " morning in kyeongseong " lately . ah , speaking of which ,
how about doing it with miss sung min ah this time as a couple ?
judging from the drama , the two of you really look great and work well together .
i 've been doing this by myself for 3 years , why would i do it with sung min ah now ?
well , it is the wish of the sponsor .
send the sponsor my message clearly : either i , kang hyun min , do it by myself ,
he will never be able to do it with someone else .
i won 't do it !
oh , you know , right ?
that scandal ... is total nonsense .
of course , i know it better than anybody .
did you want to see me to talk about that ?
no . there is someone i 'd like you to meet .
ah , there he comes .
say hello to the chief director of taesan group , kim sang jik .
i 'm anthony kim .
nice to meet you .
a production company ?
yes .
our company is going to create the largest production company in asia .
we would like you to be the ceo of that company .
we 'll offer you the highest salary in the industry as well as 10 % of the shares .
what do you think ? although , right now , you are the representative of a small production company , for someone who had once created the legend of empire , this is a matching offer , i think .
i 'm sorry , but i will decline .
why ?
are you passing up this exceptional offer ? of course , it is an attractive offer , but however , i don 't want to work under other people any more .
in thinking about our entertainment group , it 's not only into drama but includes management .
this first management contract will be with sung min ah .
if you confirm , then we will move immediately .
it 's here .
you said that you wanted to make the world 's best production , right ?
why don 't you make it , starting from here ?
every year , i will invest $ 40 million into world production .
of course , the owner will be anthony kim .
as long as we get 49 % of the shares .
what do you think ? this offer ?
exactly what is the reason you are offering me this deal ? it 's because creating a company which exceeds empire is our goal . also , the person who created the empire 's myth is you , anthony , is it not ?
i will accept . you have made the right decision !
we will complete the operating details and
i will take it as a confirmed contract .
then ...
you are finally able to achieve your dream . watching you succeed , while watching you , is also the dream that i hoped for .
♫ because your two eyes are far away , i only see you .
♫ because my heart is frozen , i 'm hugging you . ♫ when your trembling lips touch my ears , ♫ while i dreamed only of you to say the words i love you .
the person who created empire 's myth is exactly you , anthony , is it not ?
you said that you wanted to make asia 's best production did you not ?
why don 't you go ahead and try making it ?
of course , the owner is you , anthony kim .
that 's right .
the time has come .
bong dal representative , it 's me .
i 'm in the middle of a meeting . i 'm busy , so hang up .
from this moment on , i will start my own drama again .
i think i said that i was in the middle of a meeting .
i 'm busy , so hang up .
if you hang up this time , i 'm not going to leave you be .
what are taking my word for ?
i 'm busy right now but because of you ....
you said you were a busy person .
you said you were in the middle of a meeting .
exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck ?
until a few moments ago , i was busy with the meeting .
but what are you trying to say ?
by tomorrow morning , please gather the " morning in kyeongseong 's " crew .
gather ?
it 's something more important than anything .
understand ?
so , you 're going to fix the uploaded episodes 11 and 12 ?
yes , i wanted to show more of the love between the two characters .
up to now , only in episode 13 , it is realized that hye rin came to help woo jin .
and then , it was my idea that hye rin 's character would be seen as nearly sinister .
because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice .
so you will modify episode 11 by accelerating the content of episode 13 ?
yes . with that change , i think it will be possible to see the audience rooting for the two characters .
but , can you amend the screenplay in less than four days ?
i can do it .
it 's not something to be dealt with by talking . you have a point there to put the story together , but it 's a big risk .
if that is to happen , we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before .
hyun min , what do you think ?
huh ?
do it like that .
she says she can do it , so why don 't we try believing writer lee ?
is it not unimagineable , too difficult and are there problems every day ?
can you really do the script in four days ?
yes . i can do it .
fine . if writer lee says she can do it , then i will wait .
then , take care of yourself .
let 's see how well you can do .
bye .
the writer says she can do it , so why don 't we trust her once ?
i mean , that 's living .
that fox !
we 're in a state of emergency now .
i know . even if you manage to rewrite the script for 2 episodes , what comes after that is the problem .
for the following episodes , even if there is a problem in the script , we still have to shoot it without changing a thing .
i 'm fully aware of it .
you have to keep this in mind , that the decision you just made , put " morning in kyeongseong " on a path of no return .
like julius caesar who marched toward rome in b.c. 49 , we have crossed the rubicon river .
let them find out at this point ... and make a powerful ending ...
it 's unlocked . since we 're in a state of emergency , we have to save the time for sleep as well as food .
naturally , until you 're done with the revision , you can 't leave the studio .
so , what are all these ? multivitamins , red ginseng extract , omega-3 for improving circulation , and this is yogurt , good for constipation .
if you 're sitting in one place too long , you get constipated .
since your physical health is top priority , make sure to take them .
and what is that ? toothpaste , shampoo , and lotion .
also , since i don 't know what you use , i just bought one of each kind .
why , you don 't use the ones with wings ?
i bought them because they cost 1500 won more .
you 're a man , representative .
isn 't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman ?
i 'm not a man , but a producer . you 're not a woman , but a writer .
i 'll put these away and sit here , so call me if you need anything .
what ?
you 're not leaving ?
why would i leave ?
you 're not writer kim soo hyun .
what , are you sleepy already ?
no , nothing .
yes , i understand .
then , we will meet next week and discuss .
make an appointment with the production company , please .
yes , yes , good work .
by the way , director ...
there 's barely enough time for shooting , how can they revise the script now ? how about this , hiring a more experienced writer to help writer lee go eun ...
why don 't we trust writer lee go eun and wait ? seriously , director , she 's a rookie , how can we just trust and wait ?
why , didn 't you call her another writer kim soo hyun ?
well , that ..
after continuing 10 more years ..
listen , director lee ...
eh ?
just ... just , just ...
uh , director .
director ...
what do we do hyun min ?
why ? what 's the problem ?
i just heard from the korean beef commercial .
tthe sponsor says , if you don 't do it with sung min ah , he 'd choose another couple .
what ?
!
like who ? i guess they 're trying to contact jang dong gun and go so young .
jang dong gun and go so young ?
( a married couple of superstars )
miss sung min ah ...
i think i warned you , not to stare at me .
let 's talk for a moment .
i don 't have anything to talk about with you .
it 's only for a moment .
it 's a very important thing .
so , let me get this straight .
you want us to be in a korean beef commercial as a couple ?
i 'm not interested . look for someone else .
don 't take this wrong .
i don 't want to be in a commercial with you , miss sung min ah .
then why are you asking to do it together ?
well , you could call it the responsibility of the leading actor ...
besides , why are you so selfish , miss sung min ah ?
what ?
when writer lee is working so hard , are you just going to sit there and do nothing ?
when we do a commercial as a couple , it will also promote more awareness of our drama ... stop that nonsense , and tell me the real reason .
ah man , really ...
money .
can 't you just do it this once ?
i 'll do anything you ask .
fine , but i have one condition .
do a tv interview in person , mr. kang hyun min , that we 're not in a relationship .
also , release news reports to clarify the rumors .
just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us .
can you promise to do that ?
deal .
then , me too .
deal !
do you think this makes sense ?
why doesn 't it ?
kim woo jin gives up his lifelong dream and goes to rescue jin hye rin ?
what a nonsense !
he loves her that much ! of course he 'd rush to save jin hye rin , leaving everything behind .
what idiot gives up his dream for love ?
how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ? how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ? how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ?
if he loves her to death , why wouldn 't he ? in case you haven 't noticed , humans are innately selfish .
in case you haven 't noticed , humans are innately selfish .
they cry when they 're hungry , and they smile when they 're full .
have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ?
how can you not understand this ?
unlike your elementary unrequited crushes , i have had lots of experience .
how many ? like what ?
kissing and sleeping together .
you mean , doing those is love ?
what else is there to it ?
uh , so low !
yes , i 'm a third-rate lowlife .
but you don 't even have that experience .
ah , whatever .
i got it . let 's stop this conversation now .
i 'll just write the script . i 'll just write the script .
sure , you write the script .
i 'll make a trip to the office .
you still seem to think that you 're right .
but admit it , you 're wrong .
just go already !
your son looks really amazing .
producing a great drama like that .
you must be really proud of him .
he should find a good woman before i pass on .
he 's not married yet ?
i even wonder if he ever liked someone ?
because of the hardships he had to endure , he only knows to pretend to be strong .
he doesn 't know how to open up his heart to someone .
i see .
if he had been born to good parents , he could have had a happy life ... what are you doing , not writing the script ?
it 's a movie i must watch for the script .
love letter ?
yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
why would you watch it again then ?
well , to get into the emotional mood , i have to watch it even for 101st time !
it 's all because you 've never been in love that you 're watching something like this .
stop nagging like that .
i 'm going to watch it anyway .
are you doing well ?
i 'm doing fine !
you 're supposed to make others cry , not cry yourself .
are you doing well ?
( in japanese ) are you doing well ?
is that sad ?
please stop crying so ugly .
you 're disturbing the person next to you .
it 's sad but really beautiful , right ?
no ?
eh ?
about what ? after a long time has passed , she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book .
even the title of the book is " in search of lost time . "
i read that book so many times even ...
i mean it . you were never in true love , representative .
have you ever even shed tears for love ? because my eyes are blinded , all i can see is you because my heart is frozen , i wrap my arms around you when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , my heart , that had been dreaming of only you ...
because my eyes are blinded , all i see is you , because my heart is frozen ,
i wrap my arms around you .
when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , anthony , are you crazy ?
this is nonsense .
how can that tomboy look so pretty in my eyes ?
are the terms of the contract ok ?
- both kang hyun min and sung min ah agree ... so i don 't think it 'll be a problem .
don 't we need to hear what writer lee go eun thinks ?
shall we call her ?
well then , representative ...
um , representative ?
huh ?
oh , what did you say ?
ah , so cold .
it 's too cold !
it wakes me right up !
seriously .
it 's cold !
yes , chief director .
i 'm calling because the chairman would like to meet you in person and discuss the contract .
how about friday evening ?
that 's fine . i 'll see you then .
alright , we 'll decide on the time and place and contact you again .
yes , good bye .
the door is open , what are ... wait , why am i doing this ?
stop this , anthony . i 'm a producer , and she 's a writer .
i guess the others haven 't come in yet ?
why ?
here 's the revised draft of the script .
what do you think ?
it 's good .
well done .
cut !
ok !
the revised draft makes it so much easier to empathize !
the starting point isn 't too bad . pd joo , what are you doing ? !
what is the viewership rating for today ?
19.8 % .
it went up 2.1 % from the day before !
yeah !
ah , good job everyone .
" morning in kyeongseong " soars even higher as the truth behind jin hye rin 's betrayal is revealed
" morning in kyeongseong " leads the viewership rating for 6 weeks in a row , going over 20 %
as the romance of kang hyun min and sung min ah develop , " morning in kyeongseong " keeps its lead .
lately , the viewership rating has been soaring up impressively .
well , i don 't concern myself too much over the viewership ratings .
the only thing that i 'm interested in is the love from you .
actually , there is a rumor that all your attention is focused on a specific person , causing the numerous fans of mr. kang hyun min to watch " morning in kyeongseong " in jealousy .
today , we 'd like to hear the truth .
the rumor with miss sung min ah , is it really just a rumor ?
today , until you give us an answer about the rumor , i won 't let you go .
ah , just answer him , you moron !
miss sung min ah , right .
she 's a great actress .
she 's a good actor and a good person . i can swear over my family , sadly , it is only a rumor .
we 're not dating .
you 're not dating .
however , you may count on the kim woo jin that is acting with miss sung min ah . the promise made with my pride as an actor at stake ,
i must keep for sure .
ensure the health of the hubby with korean beef ?
newlywed couple style ?
more like an arranged marriage .
are you kidding me ?
hello .
today 's shooting is about a newlywed couple .
ah , i see .
did you get a botox shot ?
what ?
well , you look somewhat different .
chu ~ ?
it 's delicious .
take care of your husband 's physical health with korean beef .
korean beef !
i just visited hoengseong recently .
[ hoengseong : famous town for korean beef ]
i count on you to promote more awareness about korean beef .
what 's with that face ?
you got money and korean beef !
isn 't this awesome ?
ah , what a pathetic bum .
pathetic bum ?
do you think i 'm just doing this for the money ? even anthony and writer lee , for the drama , are working on the script together .
then we , also for the drama , could shoot commercials and promote our drama !
they 're working on the script together ?
didn 't you know ? all day long , they 're stuck together like this , working on the script , i think .
i told you not to skip the supplements .
you caught a cold because you 're not physically fit .
thirty minutes after a meal .
i 'll make sure to take them this time .
don 't smile .
you grow on me .
my studio isn 't that far .
i can just walk ...
it 's because i 'm cold .
hello ?
it 's me , min ah .
( wait over there for a moment )
yes .
are you busy ?
well , busy as usual .
then , can you get out for a moment ?
i have something to tell you , and i 'm free this evening .
alright .
alright .
i 'll see you then .
we 're going to relocate our office .
the office ?
yes , to a much bigger place .
is it something miss sung min ah helped you with ?
she introduced me to a company that wants to invest in our shares .
yes . once the contract goes smoothly tomorrow , i 'll get you a new studio with a better view , so you can prepare for the next project .
with sung min ah as the lead .
with miss sung min ah as the lead actress ?
that was their condition .
so stop beating around the bush and putting off your contract renewal , and let 's renew your contract .
yes .
it couldn 't have been easy for a rookie writer to change the course of the storyline in the middle .
you must have really helped her a lot , representative .
of course . she couldn 't have come this far without my help .
speaking of which , i 'd like to let lee go eun write our next project , too .
what do you think ?
well , if the script is good , i have nothing against it .
sure .
ah , you know what 's tomorrow , right ?
the contract with the chairman of taesan group .
yes , at 6pm in cheongdamdong , i heard .
since you 'll meet him for the first time , it would be good to talk over dinner .
so i asked them to meet there .
you used to like the restaurants there . also , tomorrow , i 'll also expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me you forgot ?
can you tell me that you don 't have any feelings for me ?
then , stop telling me to forget .
once we start again , there won 't be any reason for us to break up ever again .
min ah , i 'll wait .
also , tomorrow , i 'll expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me , you forgot .
your vision got blurry all of a sudden , and you felt dizzy ?
yes .
did you have a lot of stress lately , or did you overwork yourself ?
what man in korea doesn 't live like that ?
then , are you taking any drugs for long term ?
i 've been taking an antidepressant for about 3 years now .
three years ... then , have you had these symptoms before that ? no , it never happened before , only recently , about twice .
we 'll know more after you get a thorough physical exam and get the results back .
at this point , it seems like a side effect of the antidepressant .
cut !
okay !
we 'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes !
gwang soo , phone .
gwang soo ? so , over that pretty faced fd chick , the two of you are having a mental race ?
yes . gwang soo , in order to capture the heart of a lady ; first , you have to show her your own sexy smile often .
smile .
smile .
director ? look at sung min ah , she 's so stunned .
but if i keep sending her the same smile over and over , someday she 'll ask .
ask what ?
why do you smile like that whenever you see me ?
and then ?
then , you need to say an impactful , short , and concise phrase that will seduce her .
your eyes make me smile .
eww , it 's so cheesy !
i feel nauseous .
did you take your pills ?
you 're here ?
i said did you take your medicine ?
yes .
how 's your fever ?
i think it went down .

she overworked for a few days ...
how is it ?
her temperature is 40.8 .
she must 've been in a lot of pain ...
prepare her some fever reducer . yes .
i think we need to wait until her fever cools down .
are you conscious now ?
what happened ?
what do you mean what happened ?
your fever went over 40 and you fainted .
if it hurts you should 've said so .
what are you doing here ?
what about the contract ?
hurry up and go .
did you forget who was here today ?
how could you throw away such an important contract ?
i 'm sorry
there was a situation .
what situation ?
what problem is greater than your dream , your future ?
was writer lee go eun such an important person to you ?
why can 't you answer ?
is writer lee go eun so important to you ?
that 's right .
lee go eun is an important person to me .
i finally realized it .
that lee go eun ... is such an important person to me .
[ preview ] about when kim woo jin goes to save jin hye rin ...
i think you 're right .
you have a guy , don 't you ?
is it kim bong dal ?
if you bother writer lee one more time , i swear to god .
kang hyun min is all over the place .
i only saw his foot acting .
am i that bad at acting ?
do you honestly think my acting is that bad ?
have you ever put effort into acting ?
what are you doing tonight ?
we have to sign a contract .
why are we writing a contract on christmas eve ?
... but why does my vision get cloudy at times ?
how would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound ?
episode 16 in search of lost time i 'm sorry . something came up .
what came up ? what can possibly be more important than your dream and your future ? is writer lee go eun that important to you ?
why aren 't you answering ? i asked if writer lee go eun is that important to you . that 's right .
lee go eun is a very important person to me .
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go eun .
how dear she is to me .
i 'm sorry .
excuse me , the person that was here , where did she go ?
ah , she was discharged earlier .
lee go eun ! lee go eun , snap out of it !
lee go eun !

what happened with the contract ?
it went well .
it 's a relief .
yes , it 's a relief .
get some rest .
by the way , about kim woo jin rescuing jin hye rin . pardon ?
i think you 're right .
yes , this is anthony .
i was just wondering about calling you , too ... don 't worry . i heard that the writer was critically ill .
is she doing alright ?
yes , she is , but how did you ... ?
i heard from miss sung min ah .
the chairman is also impressed by your devoted care of your writer , and does not want to miss the opportunity of working with you .
we 'll make another appointment soon for the contract .
thank you ! bye !
bye !
[ a k ]
the person you called is not available .
connecting to the voicemail ...
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go eun .
how dear she is to me .
good news !
another commercial offer .
this time , it 's for a painkiller .
miss sung min ah is in agony because of a bad headache , and tada ~ i appear to hand you the pills .
listen carefully ...
from now on until i die , i won 't ever do another commercial with you , mr. kang hyun min .
got it ?
what 's up with her ?
does she not like it because it 's painkillers ?
i like it .
" meltaway q ! "
thank you .
thanks to you , the contract will be fine .
good for you .
also ... your feelings for writer lee go eun , i understand . working together for some time can bring the two of you closer , and you can grow on each other .
however , even after the drama is over , will your feelings stay the same ?
i won 't be impatient .
when the time comes , i 'll be able to hear the answer .
are you sure you were sick ?
yes . i was really , really sick .
did you see a doctor ?
of course i did !
aigoo , if you were that sick , you should have called me .
how could you go see a doctor by yourself ?
no , i didn 't go alone .
with whom ?
well , with ... a person ?
a person ?
who exactly ?
ah , mom , i 'm eating !
you ... have a man , right ?
no !
lee go eun got a man !
who is it ?
who ?
is it that kim bong dal guy ?
oh , no !
my tummy might get upset !
aren 't you writer lee 's mother ?
omo , if it isn 't the representative !
where are you going ?
i fixed some food for go eun , and now i 'm on my way home .
i 'll give you a ride then .
get in .
no , well , you don 't have to .
the day is too cold for you to walk .
please get in .
have you been doing well lately ?
what is there to do well ?
just being busy with my livelihood , not even noticing my own daughter getting sick .
but , by any chance , representative , do you know kim bong dal ?
kim bong dal ?
yes .
but why are you curious about that person ? well , it seems like my go eun is interested in him , but she wouldn 't tell me anything .
but , representative , is it a person you know ? well , yes , i never got to meet him in person , but i heard that he has a good reputation and his future seems bright .
according to what i 've heard , he even has good looks .
then , take care .
when you 're not too busy , come in for a meal .
yes .
thanks for the ride .
then , you should get back .
no , i 'll see you get in first and then take off .
ah , don 't worry about me and just get back .
then , i 'll see you again later .
aigoo , did he take something wrong ?
where did his manners come from ?
that 's so not like him at all !
i think the grand prize for best actor should go to shin ha gyoon . his acting was good , and , more importantly , the viewership ratings were excellent .
in terms of viewership ratings , kang hyun min is a good contender , too .
though his acting is nothing out of the ordinary , but he 's scheduled for another sbc drama next year .
the grand prize for best actor should go to a good actor .
yes , i understand both of your positions , but how about jang joo sung ?
what , jang joo sung ?
yes . yes , well , the viewership ratings were low , but just looking at acting alone , he was the best this year .
listen , m broadcasting is giving it to cha seung won , and k broadcasting is giving it to park shin yang .
yet , we 're going to give it to an obscure , aged actor ?
it 's the grand prize after all , it should go to a star with some clout . it 's not an award of appreciation .
it 's not an award of appreciation .
yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. jang to receive it ? yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. jang to receive it ?
it literally is the grand prize for best actor .
regardless of starship or viewership rating , but solely looking at the acting performance , right ? well , director , let 's take things with a grain of salt .
the awarding ceremony for the grand prize is another tv show .
it is another competition for viewership ratings .
besides , we have to discuss this matter with the variety department as they 're preparing the ceremony .
so , director nam , you should pay attention to our opinions , too , this time .
yes , i understand .
then , we shall continue this discussion in our next meeting .
i 'll come back again .
take care of yourself .
cut !
ok !
now , let 's eat before going to the next scene !
then , we 'll resume shooting in an hour .
have a good meal !
does a top star have to eat at such an open place ?
there are no good restaurants around here .
have you watched " morning in kyeongseong " this week ?
of course .
kang hyun min was practically flying in his action scenes .
all i could see of kang hyun min was his sucky acting .
that 's true .
my eyes are all for min ah noona .
how could you even notice kang hyun min ? hey , isn 't that kang hyun min over there ?
over there .
he is !
he 's good looking .
he does look superb . for real !
don 't miss your classes .
only kang hyun min . um , hyung , is sung min ah even prettier than on screen ?
yes .
make-up does wonders .
what ?
it 's sung min ah .
whoa !
sung min ah !
hyung , do it quick , hurry !
sung min ah is leaving !
i 'd like to get an autograph , too .
ah , yes .
by the way , what is your name , young man ?
brad pitt .
alright , one person at a time .
what is your name ?
- park sung hoon !
gwang soo ?
from now on , we should always eat in front of an all-girls highschool .
i was thinking of preparing red ginseng as presents for the broadcasting companies for this season .
what ?
red ginseng ?
red ginseng my bum .
that doesn 't suit the scale of the empire .
prepare imported wine . top notch grade .
yes . understood .
what ?
red ginseng ?
present red ginseng to the broadcasting companies with seasonal greetings ?
yes , i think that would be appropriate .
are you in your right mind ?
we don 't have money for that !
you may leave .
yes . ah , pd joo ,
yes .
bring me the cvs of the writers with whom we have contracts .
our ... writers ?
the only writer that has a contract with us is just writer lee .
yes , bring hers .
why do you want her cv all of a sudden ?
do i have to explain that to you ?
no .
sorry , i was too busy .
i sincerely apologize .
but i don 't think i can come to the christmas reunion this year , either , because i have to work on my script .
i guess you guys will have fun without me . yes , but instead ,
i 'll treat you generously next year after the drama is done .
alright .
see you next year .
yes .
her hobby is to watch movies , specialty is tae ... official 4th degree black belt in taekwondo ... favorite food is grilled mackerels and ... roasted sweet potatoes .
favorite movie is love letter . love letter ... yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
it 's really sad , but really beautiful at the same time .
don 't you agree ?
are you fine ?
( in japanese )
i 'm fine .
man , that scared me .
what a shock .
don 't you know how to knock ?
i did knock , but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered .
at any rate , why have you come here ?
to get some printer paper .
what were you watching , anyway ?
none of your concern .
ah , i think i know .
you know what ?
well , what men normally watch .
steamy stuff .
that 's not it .
i know men watch it quite often .
it 's ok .
i said that 's really not it .
oh , that 's love letter !
yes , it 's love letter !
i thought you didn 't like this movie ?
just to review my japanese .
that 's all .
but your japanese is excellent . superb .
to learn the dialect of kobe . their accent .
my eyes were too busy watching min ah noona .
how could you even notice kang hyun min ?
hyung ?
when is the sbc drama awards ceremony ?
the 31st . why ?
let 's see ... possible contenders for the grand prize of best actor are ... me ... me ...
there 's only me !
no way . there 's shin ha gyoon .
ah , that 's right .
ha gyoon hyung .
ah , the brain ...
shin ha gyoon of the brain is too strong ...
can 't let that happen .
at this point , i need an impactful scene that will set this kang hyun min apart for sure ! hyung , you just said that the new script is out , right ? hyung , when jin hye rin is bawling her eyes out at the end here , what if i did that ?
you ?
the viewers will be totally awed !
hyung , tell gwang soo to get the car ready .
well , gwang soo has been rather busy lately .
what ?
busy ?
the personal assistant is busier than the actor ?
well , that 's not what i mean ...
let 's just go the two of us today .
i understand .
however , take the wage for today out of gwang soo 's payment for the month .
take it out !
the closer you are , the more clearcut you have to be with money .
isn 't that right , bumblebee ?
you 're going to the military service soon ?
yes , i just got my draft notice .
please take good care of our hyun min hyung . unlike what appears on tv , there are many surprising things about hyung .
yes , i heard from representative choi that he requires a lot of extra care .
actually , hyun min hyung does not like to read the script .
so , when he 's playing videogames , you have to read it out loud to him .
also , when hyung chooses a drama , he prefers melodrama .
it 's because melodramas bring more commerical endorsement offers for the male lead .
that 's what he believes .
the more i think about it , the more it doesn 't make sense .
how can a drama not have the aspect of melodrama ?
gwang soo .
when there is an appointment , he makes sure to be later than the other actor . his sense of pride is strong , so he thinks that to wait for someone is to lose .
what ?
sung min ah is very punctual with her schedule ?
i told you to go slow , gwang soo . lastly , he may say preposterous things sometimes , but you should just agree with him .
he may not be that bright , but he 's a good hyung .
ah , hey ...
jin hye rin , kim woo jin .
i need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum ...
who is it ?
writer lee !
writer lee !
open the door !
open !
merry christmas , a present for you .
what is it this time ?
just take it , it 's really just a christmas present , nothing more .
omo ! the size is perfect , and they 're really pretty !
thank you !
now that you received my gift , shall we cut to the chase ?
that 's not possible !
why not ?
this drama is for kang hyun min , and this kang hyun min wants to bawl his eyes out .
kim woo jin is shot , and jin hye rin embraces him and cries .
yes , but instead of jin hye rin , kim woo jin can cry !
tears of a man .
how innovating is that ?
well , i suppose it could be innovating , but sung min ah is better ...
she is better what ?
ah , well , what i mean is ..
kim woo jin gets shot in jin hye rin 's place and is bleeding ...
i don 't know !
i don 't know !
i don 't know about that .
just keep in mind that this is the third time .
third time for me to ask you to change something .
i ended up swimming in the ocean and kissing that sung min ah . humanly speaking , if i scratch your back , you should scratch my back , too . give and take .
i warn you . if you don 't change it this time , i won 't go easy on you .
i sent off the new script to the printing office .
i 'll be stopping at writer lee 's studio to drop something off before going home .
yes , i see .
wait .
yes ?
i 'll just take it to her . i need to talk with her anyway .
you , representative ?
what 's with that look on your face ?
why , is it something heavy ?
hyung .
i heard about everything .
you 're going to serve in the military ?
yes . i got the draft notice unexpectedly .
i 'm sorry .
i 've come to say my last good bye .
stay in good health , hyung .
gwang soo .
i bought it myself from the grocery store .
hyung ! hyung , thank you for everything , in 2 years from now , i 'll be back in better shape .
yes , i 'll be waiting .
take care .
gwang soo !
take good care of yourself !
i mean , does that even make sense ?
he wants to do the crying scene of jin hye rin ?
at any rate , what should i do ?
he won 't get over it easily this time .
who is it ?
it 's me .
why are you here ?
this .
pd joo told me to bring it to you .
ah . so you came all the way here just to bring this to me ?
well ... thats right ...
is the script going well ?
yes .
ah , what should i do ?
what ?
mr. kang hyun min came by earlier , and ...
what did hyun min want ?
but , why are you here , representative ?
did you see writer lee go eun earlier today ?
did writer lee say that ?
she 's such a snitch .
well , about that sobbing scene , don 't you think it would be better if kim woo jin did the crying ?
hmm ...
kim woo jin crying ?
you sure are professional , understanding my gist right away . well , at the awards ceremony at the end of the year ,
ha gyoon hyung and i are strong candidates for the grand prize for best actor .
if i were to show an impactful scene at this point , i might be able to secure the award !
how 's that ? okay , so you want the script to be revised so that you 'd do the crying instead ?
exactly that !
do you think you can do that ?
huh ?
you only got this far by pure dumb luck .
with your pathetic acting skills , do you really think you can do that ?
are you done joking with me ?
nope , i 've still got a lot more to say .
do you know yourself ? your script analysis is emelentary level , you don 't even know how poor your acting is , you 're the world 's biggest idiot there ever was ! as such , when the script comes out , don 't even change one thing about it , and just read it properly !
got it ? but ... i said , do you understand !
what 's up with him ?
why is he like that to me ?
yes , i just saw hyun min .
you saw him ?
what did he say ?
didn 't he throw a fit ?
nope .
i talked to him with reason , and he accepted it with no problem .
really ?
yes . he 'll do according to the script .
is that true ?
he even said he 's sorry for bothering you . is that true ? he even said he 's sorry for bothering you .
that 's a relief .
i mean , you 're really amazing , representative .
you took care of it so easily . i was getting a headache over it .
who am i ?
who else ?
mr. kim bong dal .
anthony .
thank you .
don 't mention it .
if anything ever troubles you , just let me know any time .
you have come .
shall we ?
the chairman expects a lot from you , mr. anthony .
the preparation for relocating your office will be finished within this month .
ah , miss sung min ah is already here .
oh , i finally get to see you .
i 'm anthony kim .
aigoo , i 've heard a lot about you .
nice to meet you .
please have a seat .
i think i 'll need to take business lessons from you , mr. anthony .
don 't say something like that even as a joke .
i don 't deserve such praise .
dramas are made by people , after all .
and you , mr. anthony , know the importance of people .
which makes me very glad to be working with you . well , then ,
i look forward to the business you 'll lead , mr. anthony .
best wishes .
i don 't know how to express my gratitude to you .
then , instead of saying it to me , show me .
just like you had made the actress sung min ah into a top star , make your world production into the best company in the world .
i look forward to it .
a new personal assistant ?
yes , my name is an sung mo . you may have heard from gwang soo already , i totally abhor posers , hypocrites , and such .
call me hyung from now on .
yes . yes , hyung .
at any rate , how did it go with writer lee ?
is she going to revise the script ?
hyung , don 't get me started on it .
last night , that bastard anthony came all the way here , and ...
he came here ?
what ?
my script analysis is elementary level and he called me the worst performing actor ever !
does that make sense ?
i 'm a bad actor ?
who does he have to thank for leading the viewership ratings ?
seriously !
sung mo ?
yes .
what do you think ?
about what ?
what else ?
my acting .
yes , you used to be one of the normal viewers , so you would be an accurate judge .
tell me .
is the acting performance of this kang hyun min pathetic ?
just be honest .
just be honest .
is it really true ?
yes .
what do you mean , yes ?
well , i mean , you have good looks , but but your acting isn 't ... that great .
hey , sung mo , you must be referring to hyun min 's debut performance !
uh ... i 've watched them all ... even the most recent ones .
well , you told me to be honest .
gwang soo ...
[ gwang soo ]
uh , hyung , what i said earlier didn 't upset you , did it ?
why would it upset me ?
who do you think i am ?
sung mo , i 'm not that petty . well , that 's a relief . you know ,
i 'm really bad at lying .
i can see that .
just focus on driving . so that we won 't be late .
yes , hyung .
[ kang hyun min 's impactful performance crosses the sea with his eyes ]
honestly , kang hyun min 's acting is overrated .
his good looks covers it all . however , those looks are fading , too .
i 'm only watching it for sung min ah . when i see khm , i can 't concentrate on the show .
he sucks .
hey , what day is better than christmas day to confess your felings to her ?
you have to make a dash for it !
he 's right .
well , that 's why i bought something for her ,
what ?
what is it ?
let 's see !
show us !
excuse me .
matching rings !
am i going too forward with this ?
does the woman express the feelings first ?
it is the man who has to open up first ! hear , hear !
besides , a matching set of rings sends a direct message of " let 's date . "
it 's straightforward !
- true , true .
i read a report that the gift that women want the most for christmas is jewelry !
i got this after reading that .
what 's so merry here ?
well , pd joo got a gift for the pretty fd .
i 'm sorry , representative .
not separating my personal life from work ...
well , that 's life after all .
so what is it that you 're hiding ?
huh ?
let me see what you got her .
tada !
they 're couple rings .
supposedly , this is what women want the most for christmas .
good luck .
where do you buy stuff like that ?
would you like me to take them out for you to see ?
the second one from the right .
this one ?
is it a gift ?
no .
my nephew has been begging me for it .
pardon ?
well , i guess my nephew got a girlfriend , but he 's so shy .
ah , i see .
what is the nephew 's size ?
well , maybe ... about this ? ah , i guess his size is the same as the uncle ?
we 're family , after all .
ah .
then , what about the size of the girl your nephew likes ?
well ,
i think about this big .
you 're going to gift it , you should call and ask first .
if the size doesn 't fit after opening the gift , she may think you 're not considerate .
bong dal kim .
mr. bong dal .
yes , representative .
do you have plans this evening ?
why ?
why else ?
we 've got to write our contract .
why are we writing the contract on christmas eve ?
in the evening even ?
because i say so .
at 8pm , come to the restaurant that ... no , i 'll decide on the location .
you ?
a nice place that i really like .
must be a shabby place that suits you perfectly .
you 'll have to see for yourself . i 'll text you . see you later then .
finish the script before you come out .
i 'm done already .
that 's good .
see you later .
yes ?
this is the moonhwa university hospital .
your test results from thursday are out .
yes .
yes , i see .
i 'm on my way .
now , don 't get too excited because it 's christmas eve .
let 's finish this quick so we can get home early .
yes , understood !
for the next scene , use the 300mm lense and zoom in on hyun min 's face .
i 'm sorry . i only prepared the 200mm lense .
then , use the 200mm lense , we 'll crop later , and magnify it to look like 300mm .
yes .
excuse me .
- yes ?
where is the fd ?
she 's probably in mr. kang hyun min 's room .
ah , i see .
well , then ... do you have time this evening ?
well , if the shooting gets done early enough , sure . then , we 'll resume shooting in 5 minutes , so tell mr. kang hyun min to get ready , please .
yes , i understand .
woo jin !
woo jin !
are you okay ?
how can this be ?
!
this is all my fault !
woo jin !
woo jin !
are you alright ?
don 't worry .
the people ...
i am sorry .
cut !
let 's go again .
ready ?
action !
don 't worry .
soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i really am sorry .
cut !
let 's take a break for 10 minutes .
what exactly is the problem ?
is it because i refused the commercial endorsement deal ?
that 's not it .
if not , then why are you making me cry for hours like this ?
!
i 'm really sorry .
i 'm just feeling under the weather today .
i 'm really sorry . i 'm really sorry .
how much have i cried ?
my eyes are gonna be all puffed up .
unni , can you get me an ice pack ?
yes .
do you have some time ?
i have something to say .
start talking . what is it ?
you 're not hung up about the commercial ...
is my acting really that bad ?
from your perspective , is my acting really poor ? from your perspective , is my acting really poor ?
what do you want me to say ?
please tell me honestly . as an actress . for you to ask me in person , doesn 't that mean you already think so ?
then , let me ask you one thing .
have you ever put any effort into acting ?
or do you know about your weaknesses ?
then , what about you ?
do you have a weakness you know about ?
who doesn 't have weaknesses ?
i 'm still practicing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to improve my pronunciation since my debut .
ga gya geo gyeo , like a child learning the alphabet , with a pen between my teeth .
if you really felt a problem with your acting , you yourself have to know what it is to fix it .
no matter what other people tell you , you have to know it for yourself .
spend some time to think about it .
it doesn 't seem like a side effect of the antidepressant .
there doesn 't seem to be a problem with your other tests .
then why does my vision get blurry sometimes ?
hmm ... how about getting yourself tested at the opthalmology ?
i 'll arrange it .
since you 're here already , why don 't you get tested .
tada ~ it looks nice .
what exactly is the problem ?
do you have a family member with poor eyesight ?
yes .
that is correct .
is that your mother ?
yes , but how ? yes , you have leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy that is maternally inherited .
it progresses really fast with few preliminary symptoms , so your right eye is already in bad shape .
looking at the pace of the condition , your right eye will lose its sight completely soon .
once that happens , unfortunately , even your left eye will ... eventually , you 'll lose sight in both your eyes .
wow , i hadn 't seen you in a while .
have you been well ?
yes , have you been well ?
yes .
would you like to order ?
well , i 'm waiting for someone today . when he gets here , i will .
did you get a boyfriend by any chance ?
no .
i 'm here .
where are you ?
i 'm here ...
where are you ?
in search of lost time
please leave a trace after reading the book .
( all entries are by lee go eun )
since your mother has this condition , you must know it very well .
there is no real way to cure it .
i regret to say this , but you should make preparations before both eyes lose sight .
ah , what are you doing ?
!
can 't you pour the water properly ?
my eyes sting !
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not eating !
why ?
does it taste bad ?
you eat it , mom .
you can 't even tell sugar and salt apart !
dummy .
idiot !
excuse me .
i guess the traffic is bad .
um ... i 'm sorry , but we 're closing .
ah , yes ...
where did you go to be back so late ?
you ignored my text and my calls .
what is this ?
i 'm sorry .
well , was something the matter ?
yes .
my mother was not well .
omo . is she doing okay ?
well , if that 's what happened , why didn 't you tell me ?
well , i guess you didn 't really have the mind to do that .
get in .
since you so desperately wish to renew my contract , i 'll do it .
let 's do that later .
it 's late . get back and rest .
lee go eun ...
when did it start ?
your feelings for me .
i deceived you .
i betrayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite all that , when did you start liking me ?
episode 17 do not be afraid of the darkness i deceived you . i betrayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite that , when did you start liking me ? did something happen ?
nothing happened . get inside and rest . representative !
why was he like that ?
what happened that he even had tears in his eyes ?
regrettably , it looks like the initial diagnosis still stands .
since your mother has this condition , you must know this already , but there is no way to cure it at this point .
* currently , no cure is available .
how to learn braille
you need to start getting ready for it .
normally , people with acquired blindness take about 3-5 years to adjust to be able to perform daily functions .
even just getting out of the house can feel like a formidable challenge .
from just grabbing a spoon to going to the bathroom , you have to learn how to do them by yourself .
do you have family that could take care of you ?
what is the percentage ?
the chance of me going blind .
i 'll ask one more question .
why is it me ?
my mom wasn 't enough ?
why are you even doing this to me ? i have finally found the reason why i must produce dramas , and i have also found the person who pointed it out to me .
and yet , after all that , why did you choose me ?
tell me . if you 're there , tell me !
why is it me ?
why ?
!
ready .
action !
my face ... take a good look .
this face ...
don 't ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
i 'm sorry , but can we do it again ?
but your eyes were really good just now .
why ? no , my gaze at jin hye rin needs to be full of sadness ,
i don 't think it was enough this time .
alright then .
alright , let 's do it one more time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
let 's do it one more time .
the director said it was okay .
why do you keep asking him to film it again ?
don 't pity me .
i 'm not saying this out of pity !
your eyes really did look sad ! i appreciate your comforting words , but you have to clearly point out my flaws for my acting to improve so that i can become a good actor .
director !
let 's do it one last time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget it .
cut !
how 's this one ?
you satisfied ?
yes .
i think it 's okay .
okay .
then , get ready for scene 38 !
sung mo !
script !
yes , hyung .
what 's wrong with him ?
did something happen ?
he wants to get better .
get better at what ?
acting skills .
hyun min said that ?
yes .
i 'm going to be worn out , it seems .
things to do from now on .
what are you doing ?
just some things .
can we speak ... for a bit ?
come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday .
in search of lost time
after so much time has passed , she finally reads the confession the man had left in the book .
and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go eun ♥ and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go eun ♥
when did you come ?
just now .
ah , i see .
i will answer the question you asked yesterday .
it 's true that i like you .
i don 't know since when , but it 's correct that i like you .
i will also ask one question .
yesterday ... why did you cry ?
there 's something wrong right ?
i 've been suffering from depression for three years .
that 's why i 'm crying , so it has nothing to do with you , so don 't mind it .
pretend that the issue of contract renewal never happened .
as if it never happened ?
what are you suddently talking about ?
there is one reason .
the relationship between a producer and writer should be upright with the right amount of fear and respect .
since the moment you started liking me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
then ...
what about sung min ah ?
you didn 't do that at that time .
but now it 's like that .
we can 't continue working together .
does that answer your question somewhat ?
i will take my leave .
i have an important appointment .
you 've come again .
hello !
who ... ?
the writer who came last time .
it 's good to meet you . i actually wanted to see you .
is your body fine ?
i heard you weren 't well yesterday .
did my son say that yesterday ?
ah ...
i guess i must 've heard wrong .
nowadays is out of control because of the script .
you have a hard time because of my son right ?
no , he is so nice to me .
that 's good , that you think about him like that . he grew up with a blind single parent , so his personality is _ _ _ _ _ , but his heart is kind .
i heard ... that you couldn 't see when he was five ...
at that time ... my heart hurt so much ... at first , my vision started to get blurry , but i thought it would get better over time .
instead , one eye went blind , and the other eye ended up blind as well .
i found out later that that 's how optic neuropathy progresses .
at any rate , you must be a special person to my son .
huh ?
why do you think so ?
because he told you about things like that .
ah . to be honest ...
i confessed my feelings to the representative .. .and i got rejected .
my son ... by nature , has no vision for women .
right ? !
i mean i 'm this pretty ...
i think he really doesn 't have an eye for girls .
what are you talking about ?
that doing business together is going to be hard ?
i 'm sorry .
can i ask the reason why you are refusing ?
it 's a personal issue , so i can 't tell you .
i hope that instead of me , you will find a good partner .
childish ! say if you don 't like a person , you 're always nagging me about the script .
if you know , hurry up and write the script , everyone is waiting .
i am a crazy girl for worrying about bong dal .
crossing out " cancel the investment deal with taesan "
morning of kyeongsong end of episode 19
i sent the 19th episode
got it .
ah ... it 's done , but ...
mr. kang hyun min sure will complain about the hair ...
the 19th episode came out .
really ?
it came out a lot faster than i thought .
what ?
i guess hyun min 's hairstyle changes , to a shorter haircut .
what ? what , what , what ?
so you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult .
could you please change that part this time ?
i 'm very sorry .
i was concerned about it , too , actually .
you don 't think you can persuade him ?
it is to signify the start of kim woo jin 's choice of an ordinary life .
to tell you the truth , hyun min is currently working on getting an endorsement deal for a shampoo .
an endorsement for shampoo ?
yes .
so , if he gets a haircut , he won 't be able to do it at all .
yes .
if it 's about an endorsement deal , kang hyun min sure wouldn 't want to cut his hair .
exactly !
i 'm sorry , miss writer .
i guess it can 't be helped .
i 'll change it .
really ? oh , thank you !
miss writer lee !
writer lee !
isn 't this hyun min 's voice ?
- writer lee !
i guess he 's already come to complain .
writer lee !
- don 't tell him that i was here !
writer lee !
open this door , now !
oh heavens !
what do you think ?
is this acceptable ?
you got a haircut !
of course .
a new woo jin style .
but , how did you ...
why ?
i got it cut after i saw the script .
do you want it shorter ?
just tell me !
well , mr. hyun min , weren 't you after a shampoo endorsement ... ?
who cares about endorsements ?
even if a tv or a car endorsement deal is on the table , if it is for the drama , i should cut it !
with overflowing spirit !
hyung !
what are you doing here ?
well , actually , to thank her for making your character so awesome .
that 's why i 'm here .
is that so ?
at any rate , writer lee , the last week of morning in kyeongseong will be full of this kang hyun min 's impactful acting spirit , just you wait .
fighting !
fighting !
director nam , what do you mean by that ? you can 't extend morning in kyeongseong ?
to extend a drama that was originally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we 're only doing it for the ratings .
rather than that , just finishing the drama with its current quality seems to be the better choice , in my judgment .
listen , director nam . " morning in kyeongseong " has just gone over 25 % , and is on the verge of getting into the 30 % range .
if we add 4 more episodes , we 'll get the rating over 30 % for sure , how can you suggest not doing it ? however , if you just prolong the story , it will inevitably lead to a drop in the quality .
in that case , it may ruin what we have accomplished so far with " morning in kyeongseong . "
director nam , are you crazy ?
do you know how much of the profits from commercials depends on 1 % of the ratings ?
this isn 't a place of art !
this is a business that needs to make a profit ! well , director ... - director nam ,
i understand your point of view , director nam . but this time , i would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself .
four more episodes ?
yes .
i 'm surprised by your lack of enthusiasm .
don 't producers usually welcome extension deals in a situation like this ?
yes , we 'll make the necessary preparations .
then ...
why ?
does he think 4 is too short ?
no , no .
he says he 'll prepare for it .
if we add 4 more episodes , that means 4 more weeks from now , starting with episode 19 .
i wonder what the odds are for my eyesight to last until then ?
could i really do it ?
no , i must do it .
please , hang on until then .
well now , i know how everybody must be tired , but since it 's been decided to extend the show , let 's do our best to the end ! yes !
fighting !
what do you think ? to spike up the last pitch , new woo jin style !
what 's with your faces ?
your hair ... why did you cut it so soon ?
excuse me ?
i cut it too soon ? well , we got an extension of 4 more episodes .
extension ?
yes .
well , to prolong the story , the ending will have to change .
hyun min , since it 's been extended , let 's go for 30 % of the viewership rating !
i 'm counting on you !
what were you doing , not being aware of the extension deal ?
my last big impact !
the new haircut of woo jin style !
how can you make it all into nothing like this ? ! hyun min , at any rate , now that it 's been decided , let 's go for 30 % of viewership rating , and get more money for the extended episodes .
isn 't that swell ?
hyung , is money all your concern ?
from now on , don 't ever insult my passion and spirit for acting with mere money .
well , then , are you not going to ask for a raise ?
how much more did sung min ah ask for ? are you crazy ? you know that you 're scheduled for a movie right away , and yet you agreed to the extension ?
min ah , this isn 't just any movie , but a movie directed by cho kyu sik .
besides , you 're the lead actress .
you know fully well how your schedule won 't allow for both the drama and the movie .
isn 't it your job to make that schedule work ?
so , just do as i said .
who exactly is the reason why you 're doing this ?
is it for anthony ? or ,
kang hyun min ?
is it because of him ?
listen carefully .
don 't ever stick me with that moron again !
got it ?
why do you keep barging in when i didn 't call you ?
extension ?
yes .
but i just have one more episode to work on .
how can i add 4 more episodes ? in order to write those 4 episodes without sacrificing the quality , we have to revise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday .
episode 19 ... uh ...
i know it won 't be easy .
however , from episode 19 to 24 , you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away .
the live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started .
you can do it , right ?
i will have to .
yes . as this is an emergency , put extra effort and write with speed .
where are you going ?
why ?
well , last time , you came fully loaded even with health supplements . i 'm not writer kim soo hyun or anything , i couldn 't possibly write on without discussing the plot , is what you had said .
we should discuss the plot .
this is an emergency .
i 'm not doing this because i have ulterior motives .
did i ask ?
the new episode 19
i 'm glad that we got done so fast .
you have to keep this pace from now on .
ah , before you leave , could you get me a glass of water ?
are you asking me to do that for you ?
what can you do ?
the writer with high viewership ratings is currently busy writing .
what are you doing ?
can 't you see it 's overflowing ?
you can 't even pour me some water ?
so don 't ask me to do it again !
did you do it on purpose ?
yes , that 's right .
just move !
it spilled to the floor !
let 's go . just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give up ? sung mo , get your emotions into it !
go again .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give it up ?
ah , this isn 't working , either .
i need something to help me get into it .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
are you sure you won 't give up on your dream ?
as long as you are by my side . woo jin ,
woo jin hugs hye rin .
no , no , no !
i can 't practice at all like this .
can 't you stop now ?
you 've been at it for 4 hours already .
we even skipped lunch !
wait a minute .
why didn 't i think of this before ?
instead , i can only give you 2 days a week for your drama .
that 's the least you can do , min ah .
of course .
i understand .
miss sung min ah ?
you can answer it .
oh , there 's no need .
it 's not an important call .
the phone is turned off , so the voicemail ...
ignoring my calls , huh ?
ok .
we have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the latest .
yes .
i 'm so sorry , director .
i 'll be right back .
why do you keep calling me ?
if only you had answered it the first time .
you 're the one who made me call you several times .
i 'm in a meeting with a film production .
that 's none of my concern .
just come to the shooting site right now .
shooting doesn 't start until 2 hours from now !
that 's why we should get together and practice !
if you don 't come now , i 'll call the film production myself , got it ?
bye !
he must have really lost his mind !
victory !
let 's go with this spirit !
sung mo !
i 'll be back , gwang soo .
hey , what about lunch ?
what should i do ?
i 'm so sorry , director .
looks like i have to go now for the shooting schedule today .
it 's ok .
you may go .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll talk to you later , director .
they must be really going great together .
yes ?
kang hyun min and min ah , i mean .
yes ? ah , no , that 's not really ... at any rate , there must be no wedding announcements before the movie release .
yes ? just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
let 's leave .
just like any other ...
you 're here !
isn 't it really cold outside ?
let 's leave .
we should practice it like we 're really doing it !
on your feet !
practice is only practice .
this kang hyun min 's acting is for real !
do you normally practice so casually , miss sung min ah ?
if you really want to do it for real , get rid of that script first .
ok .
now , ready , action !
let 's leave . just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
can you really give up on your dream and live on ?
as long as you 're with me .
woo jin ...
mr. kang hyun min ...
i 'm so sorry !
we start shooting in 10 minutes .
what are you doing ?
go and clear up her misunderstanding !
is that petty little misunderstanding that important ?
my burning passion for acting won 't die because of it !
now , one more time .
why do you have to be so extreme in everything ?
i e-mailed you the script for episode 19 , mr. kim bong dal .
wow , he doesn 't even text me back any more .
start outlining episode 20 .
we can 't always work on it together .
since they 've worked for me , i know how skilled and faithful they are .
well , with your recommendation , i know they must be good , sunbae .
hm , looks like they have quite some experience ?
they 've gone through a lot in this field .
they 'll be a great asset to you .
you have to pay them at least that much .
at any rate , why are you handing over such great workers ? ah , well , it 's because ...
yes , director .
i just needed to stop at the office .
yes , i 'll be there in about 2 hours .
hello ?
is this world production 's joo dong suk pd ?
yes , but who is this ?
hello , i 'm calling on behalf of drama production company golden song .
we would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benefits .
could we have a meeting ?
ah , uh , me ?
yes , i heard that you are very talented .
we 'll give you 20 % more than your current salary . ah , yes , well , but , actually , i 'm currently working on a project .
also , to leave my current company all of a sudden seems ... of course , we understand .
you can take your time to consider our offer while finishing up with your current project .
we 'll contact you again .
what now ? you were so heartbroken by that girl , did something good happen ?
i just got a job offer from another drama production company . hey , you too ?
i got one , too !
me too !
what ?
we all got an offer from somewhere ?
even so , i want to keep working with representative kim to the end .
i suppose i will , too .
at any rate , the salary they offered was pretty tempting .
true , after all , our company is on the low side when it comes to salaries in this field .
speaking of which , i have a good idea .
the four of us can keep our loyalty , but let 's ask for a raise of 10 % .
or else , we 'll quit .
threaten him like that in fake ?
yes .
isn 't it great ?
i 'm in .
i 'm in , too .
are you in ?
in .
he 's in , too .
what are you doing so huddled up together ?
representative , i have something to tell you .
i 'll listen to it later .
i have something to say first .
once " morning in kyeongseong " is finished , i 'm going to close my company .
what ? i got a partnership offer from taesan group , but they didn 't want to keep your employment .
by taesan ... one of the top , leading companies in the country .
therefore , everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over .
team leader park , you should calculate the severance fee for everyone and put it on my desk .
hey , what was that ?
did we just get backstabbed ?
i heard that wrong , right ?
no wonder he had been surprisingly nice to us lately .
what was the number from that other production company ?
crossing out " transfer employees ( close the company ) "
sweet potato
what ?
what else ?
i just got done with episode 20 .
so , if you 're in the office , make a short trip to my studio .
what do you think ?
you did pretty well by yourself .
what ?
this doesn 't make sense .
where ? scene 38 , if hye rin is meeting with representative kang , is she betraying woo jin again ?
ah , that 's because there is a surprise element later on .
it 's all explained in scene 56 .
what is it ?
ah , no , nothing .
what do you think ?
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read it to the end !
i read it all .
you just flipped the page , and you read it all ?
yes , speedreading .
besides , i said it 's good .
why are you complaining ?
just keep writing the script . starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go page by page .
moonhwa university hospital , please .
your condition is progressing much faster than most other patients .
unfortunately , your right eye has already lost it 's sight .
it 's already started for your left eye , too .
how long will it take ?
for the left eye to lose sight completely ?
no .
how much time do i have left ? it is difficult to say for sure , but looking at it 's current pace , somewhere between 4 weeks and 2 months from now , your left eye will lose sight as well .
the more i think about it , the angrier i get .
he was so careless and rude .
was i clingy or what ?
is reading this that hard ?
why does it have 2 sheets of page 3 ?
then , he didn 't get to see scene 56 at all .
what do you think .
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read to the end !
i read it all .
why did he lie like that ?
at first , my vision was just blurry a little .
i thought it would get better over time .
but one eye lost its sight , and eventually , the other one did , too .
what are you doing ?
it 's overflowing !
what is it ?
no , nothing .
i found out later that that 's how optic neuropathy progresses .
this can 't be !
that 's not possible !
representative !
are you inside ?
how to learn braille
what to do from now on : 1 . mother 2 .
learnbraille 6 .
care facility for the blind
at least up until now , writer lee has been good about not making us do live shooting .
of course , that ends tomorrow .
yes .
it 's been 5 years since the last time i had to do that dogged live shooting .
director .
what is it ?
do you think you can finish morning of kyeongseong if i am not here ?
what do you mean ?
can you do it ?
why ?
does that taesan or whatever company want you to start working with them sooner ?
yes ?
i heard from joo pd .
i heard that you got a partnership offer there .
ah , yes .
go if you must , but only after finishing this .
even though i have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you , this drama doesn 't work even for a day without you , representative kim .
therefore , until this is done , don 't even think about running away .
now , let 's pick up the pace !
it 's going to get dark soon !
- yes !
yes !
is the preparation for the move going well ?
i 'm talking about the move to taesan group .
when will it be ?
ah , that matter ... i want to send flowers . when is it ?
well , the priority at the moment is " morning in kyeongseong . "
so just focus on the drama for now .
the date for the move hasn 't been decided yet ?
we 'll get to it eventually .
then ...
forgetleego eun
therelationshipbetweenthe writerandtheproducer requires a balanced tension of fear and respect .
now that you have started to like me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
crossingout " forgetlee goeun "
shall we go in ?
too much cold air isn 't good for you .
maybe in just a little bit .
hello !
you 're busy .
why did you come ?
i 'm not busy .
my employees are doing all the work .
still , as the representative , you should be present in the work place .
you shouldn 't just leave all the work to your employees .
mom .
what ? when i was young , what was it like when i made fun of you and was mean because you couldn 't see ?
wasn 't it upsetting ?
when was that ... such a long time ago .
i 'm sorry , mom .
what 's the matter ?
did something happen ?
tell me .
did something bad happen to you ?
it 's nothing .
once my current drama is done , i might be off to abroad because my business is going so well .
so stay still . since i might not be able to see your face for a while ,
i want to keep your face in my eyes .
oh , i see .
it 's a good thing that your business is going well .
instead of worrying , just go and return , because i will be fine .
your hands are cold .
let 's go inside , mom .
yes .
by the way , is that a new scarf ?
yes .
i got it as a gift .
a gift ?
from whom ?
she begged me not to tell you ... actually , to tell you the truth , i ... confessed my feelings to the representative and got rejected .
mychild just doesn 't have a good eye for women .
that 's right .
i 'm pretty like this .
i agree that he doesn 't have an eye for women .
i brought a present for you .
there 's a present ?
yes .
i knit it myself , it keeps you really warm in the winter .
if you look here , it says b d k .
b-d-k ?
yes .
bong dal kim .
you shouldn 't do that to such a nice young lady . if it 's because you have to go abroad , tell her .
because it seems to me , she really is a nice girl .
where have you been ?
did you finish the script ?
it 's cold . instead of catching cold again , go in .
how long were you going to conceal it ?
until when were you going to conceal the fact that you are going blind ?
you said it was depression .
you said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business .
correct .
it 's none of your business so beat it .
how can it not concern me ?
so what ?
what can you do for me ?
yes .
what you are saying about my not being able to see is correct .
i won 't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom .
i won 't be able to see the dramas which i made .
or the scripts either .
i won 't be able to see your face and where you are standing , and whether you are smiling or crying
i won 't be able to see .
is that why you are giving up ?
what if i say it doesn 't matter to me ?
for me , it doesn 't matter .
we have to endure lack of sleep , script by pages , and miserable life to make sure there 's no shame in our every minute , every second and keep us reminded of who we are at this moment .
the last tape of " morning in kyeongseong " hasn 't made it to the editing room yet .
even if it 's just 1 % of hope , that 's better than nothing .
a miracle is not something you wait for , but something you create .
the representative , the representative , on his way , had an accident ...
you must come back with that miracle !
the finale the last of the king , or the last king . where have you been ?
did you finish the script ? don 't catch a cold in this cold weather . hurry and go in .
until when are you going to hide that ? until when are you going to hide the fact you 're going blind now ? you said , what , depression ?
didn 't you say it 's none of my business so don 't bother ?
yes .
it 's none of your business , so back off .
why is it none of my business ?
so what ?
what can you do for me , then ? that 's right . as you said , it 's true that i won 't be able to see any longer .
i won 't be able to eat or go to the washroom by myself . i won 't be able to see the dramas i made , or your scripts ,
or your face either .
even where you 're standing , even whether you 're smiling at me or crying ,
i won 't be able to see all of them .
is that why you 're giving up ?
what if i say it still doesn 't matter ?
i 'm saying it doesn 't matter to me .
it will be difficult ( for you ) to endure .
even so , i want to go that way .
let 's go together .
maybe , this will be my last time to see the sunrise .
even if you can 't see , i will make you be able to feel it .
and beside you , i will be there .
even if you can 't see the dramas you made , even if you can 't see my face or my drama , where you 're standing , whether you 're smiling at me or crying , i will see all of them .
since we came all the way here , will we have some time to sleep ?
what ... what did you say ?
why are you so startled ?
wa ... wait !
i ... am ... not that easy of a woman .
what are you thinking now ?
i 'm saying let 's take a short nap in the car .
considering that our way back home would be a great hardship , don 't you think we should take a nap ?
so vulgar !
that 's right !
i 'm so vulgar !
with this driving skill , how on earth did you get your driving license ?
i told you , this is the first time i 'm driving since i got the license !
to be precise , this is your second time .
what ?
once to come here , and second time to go back .
if it 's your second time , there should be some improvement .
you chickened out !
just look where you 're driving !
okay . from now on , for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes , we should run around busily making sure they will be aired with no accident .
even if we have to endure a life like a third-rater with light sleeping and page-by-page scripts , those minutes and seconds of our rrespective moments will make us later remember ourselves in this right moment . the scripts will be handled by writer lee and me , so pd joo , manager han , manager park and koo hee jae , you guys take care of the filming sites . yes .
yes .
well , then do your best in your post .
got it ?
yes !
the real problem here is sung min ah , who is currently filming both our drama and a movie . since sung min ah 's schedule isn 't favorable , you should write the script minimizing jin hye rin 's portion as much as possible .
you can do it , right ?
i will even kill jin hye rin if i have to at the last episode to make sure , so don 't worry .
the script for episode 20 arrived !
did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well ?
yes .
good . from now on , for all the scripts we will receive , we should film the scenes of min ah putting together as much as we can , so organize the schedule accordingly .
yes .
well , well , hurry up .
let 's run again !
yes .
kim woo jin , kim woo jin , kim woo jin , kim woo jin ! sung mo , - how many scenes in total ?
it 's 52 vs 36 .
overwhelmingly , you have many more scenes !
finally , my effort is shining .
the real value of my acting on the screen finally touched writer lee . therefore , sung mo , you should try , too .
find your flaw .
the one who doesn know about one 's self would never be able to improve .
sung mo , what is your flaw ?
well , i don 't know , my flaw is ...
hemorrhoids ?
hemorrhoids ?
that ...
you just need to go to the hospital to treat it . well , by the way , hyung , all those lines , will you be able to memorize them all ?
if there are only a few lines , that 's the problem , not the other way around .
taking this opportunity , i should clearly show kang hyun min 's burning acting skills !
let 's go .
at the begining of episode 21 , jin hye rin is captured by president kang .
to save hye rin , kim woo jin will fight alone against all the enemies .
so that we can film jin hye rin 's scenes at once , all together in a long take ?
exactly !
it can enhance it 's dramatic tension and also help us manage the filming schedule .
kang hyun min would have a hard time , though .
good , let 's proceed in that way .
but how are your eyes ? are they alright ?
the other side 's eye is still fine .
what are you doing now , not writing ?
okay .
ah , i think i 'm really a genius , don 't you think so ?
but really ... when was it that you started to like ?
huh ?
when did you start to like me ?
what about you ?
i asked you first .
so , for me ... when there was the argument about plagiarism , you ... you said ... you would believe me no matter what ...
what about you ?
i don 't remember .
it 's not fair !
i told you everything !
just write your script .
hurry up and tell me ! when was it ?
if you don 't tell me , i won 't write any more .
if you finish your script , then i will tell you .
that 's really low .
did you find that out just now ?
ready , action !
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment .
on that day when we first met at woo mi theater ...
the day we first met ...
cut !
i will do it again .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , when we aimed a gun at each other ...
on that day ...
cut !
ah !
what was the next line ?
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , even the day when we aimed a gun at each other ...
cut !
hyun min !
let 's read the script once and try again .
no , director !
i can do it !
let 's try again .
no , no .
let 's take a 5-minute break .
ah !
i really memorized all !
just use a prompter . what ?
whom do you think is responsible for this ?
are you saying i should cheat for acting , while reading lines from a prompter ?
i was just trying to help .
no need .
you seem to think i can 't do this , but wait and see .
i will act perfectly after memorizing all the lines .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , even on that day we aimed a gun at each other .
i have never forgotten about all of them , not even for a moment .
so , please , believe me .
i believe you .
this is the only choice to let us be together .
cut !
ok !
hyun min ! everything was great , including your last stare !
ha ! of course , who am i ! ?
considering the speed of progress of your disease , it will be a burden if you keep working .
but there is something i must do .
if the blindness is unavoidable , i 'm thinking to work as much as i can . actually , there is something i didn 't tell you because i didn 't want to give you too much hope .
recently , in bascom palmer eye institute in florida , u.s. , there was the first clinical trial of dna treatment for this disease .
its result showed some patients to be cured , even if its success rate is really low . we don 't know when they will announce the start of the second trial , and although when it is announced , it won 't be easy for you to be on the list , but i will try my best as well .
thank you .
go eun !
mom is here .
oh , you 're here !
i 'm sorry , but i have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible .
geez , i won 't interrupt , so just keep writing !
hey , do you have an assistant writer ?
no , why ?
then , why do you have two toothbrushes ?
oh , that is ...
i haven 't seen these before , either .
wait , aren 't these for men ?
no , no ... that 's not ... you !
by any chance , that bong dal or something , did you let him in here all the time ?
no , mom , that 's not the case !
oh , you 're here !
oh , you came at the right time .
representative , you said you know the guy named kim bong dal .
please give me his contact detail .
ah mom , that 's not the case .
what do you mean that 's not the case ? here are two toothbrushes , and even a man 's lotion . these are clearly its evidence !
this bastard !
i have to see his face ! ah ...
mother ... there must be some misunderstanding .
the guy named kim bong dal isn 't that bad .
that 's why i 'm saying i will meet him .
mom , later , later , i will introduce him to you later .
later my ass !
i can just call him myself now .
mom ... mom !
here it is !
bong dal !
mom !
it 's my alarm .
give it back to me !
ah , mom , so ... just leave !
can 't you see me not being able to work now ?
anyway , you !
this is a warning !
warning !
hello !
what is this ?
what do you mean ?
it 's a cup of coffee .
have some .
by the way , why did you write it yesterday ?
over there , on the pillar .
well , that 's because you seemed to have a really hard time , so i just wrote it on there .
is that all ?
then , of course , that 's all .
what else can it be ?
many women don 't know their own feelings .
fine . if your feeling for me is that deep , i won 't resist it any longer , not like i did before .
what did you say ?
you fell for me , right ?
please , don 't have such illusions !
you want to keep your pride ?
i also know well about women 's pride .
seriously ... what the ... cute . lovely .
there 's a limit to how simpleminded you can get ...
what if he starts clinging to me like a leech ?
i 'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is .
ridiculous ...
min ah .
oh , director !
i was meaning to call you as well .
i know you 're busy .
my schedules are stacked because of the movie and the drama .
well i 'm calling for your next project which we discussed before .
what do you think to work for writer kim eun sook 's drama ? ( of " secret garden " " a gentleman 's dignity " )
that 'd be excellent if we work with writer kim eun sook !
but , did the rep. agree to that ?
to work with writer kim eun sook ?
oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ? what news ? oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ?
what news ?
anthony has declined tae san group 's offer due to personal reasons .
what the hell happened ?
they 're saying you declined tae san group 's investment offer due to personal reasons .
that 's correct .
so what exactly is that personal reason ?
the reason ...
i 'll tell you on the day " morning in kyeongseong 's " last episode airs .
so please finish well .
cut !
ok !
that was great !
prepare the next scene !
23.9 !
good work everyone .
i want to review the documents so send them over .
yeah .
happy new year !
happy new years , morning in kyeongseong success to 26.8 % rating !
1 , 2 , 3 !
" morning in kyeongseong , " the new year 's result .
- the highest viewership rate 26.8 % .
i 've finished up to scene 52 . oh , pd joo , we will send the script up to scene 52 by e-mail , so check your e-mail right away .
" morning in kyeongseong , " broke its highest viewership rate again to 27.3 % .
here are the scripts !
29.3 !
yay !
" morning in kyeongseong , " only left for its last episode , aiming to be over 30 % .
done !
send it by e-mail , quickly .
i 've sent the e-mail too . now , it 's really done !
you 've done a great job .
you would want to have a good sleep , but you need to go somewhere with me .
at this late hour ?
change your clothes and come out .
where ?
you 're here .
yes .
why are you staying there ?
come in .
who is ... ?
hello .
the writer who gave you a scarf present .
i know who it is by her voice .
welcome .
mom , i kept my promise .
okay .
what ... promise ?
there is something like that .
what is ... that promise ?
yes .
i 've just received a message from the u.s .
please come to the hospital as soon as possible .
the second clinical trial 's patient list is announced .
you 're on that list . as i 've told you before , the possibility to avoid your blindness is as low as a miracle , but let 's hope for that miracle .
ah , and the reason i asked you to come here urgently was because you need to leave tomorrow , right away .
tomorrow ?
yes .
among the subject patients , there was one patient , who missed the timing to treat and went blind in both eyes , so that 's why you could be on that list instead of that patient .
to meet the due date per florida time , you must leave for florida tomorrow .
what is that expression about ?
i understand .
let 's do that .
you ... you 're really capable , i guess . i don 't know why , but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind .
the charges are dropped , and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened .
ah , yes , i 'm really sorry to bother you for this .
sometime soon , i 'll arrange a meeting .
let 's have dinner together .
ah , yes ... yes , then ...
let me ask you just one thing .
what is the reason you tried to protect that bastard ?
please let me tell you once again .
what i want to protect is only the drama " morning of kyeongseong , " which i 'm in charge of as director of drama department . and also , your interruption in my drama by using that dirty trick , i hope that never happens again from now on .
fine .
but you should know this one thing at least . that dirty trick you 're talking about , you also had benefits from it .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of faction or connections ?
what ... what are you talking about ?
that 's right .
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you despise so much !
anthony is released ?
what are you saying ?
!
i heard that the case is closed now .
i think that chairman ordered to drop the charges .
the chairman ?
it 's me , mr. chairman .
i don 't know what to say to express my gratitude .
you 'd better thank director nam woon hyeong .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of faction or connections ?
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you despise so much !
what brings you here at this late hour , representative kim ?
i came to say thank you . well , i don 't know what you 've heard or where , but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but can i ask you how you resolved it ?
i don 't think i have to tell you about that .
yeah .
yes ?
yes , it 's me .
huh ?
mom ...
mom !
how did this happen ?
this afternoon , her condition suddely became critical .
but luckily , the critical moment is gone , and now she 's stable .
so , you don 't need to worry so much .
are you ok ?
i didn 't know your mother was still alive .
why did you say it like that before ?
that she had passed away .
i ... really hated them .
our extreme poverty , my father who abandoned me as soon as i was born , whose face i 've never seen , and even my mother who is blind .
i hated them all and was ashamed of them .
when i got to the usa , i made a resolution .
that i will forget everything that happened in korea . from now on , i 'm anthony , i don 't know anything about poverty , and i grew up in the states , i 'm anthony .
and that 's what i told everybody , too . that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance .
that i grew up with a happy childhood .
i 'm ... a big coward .
what 's the next scene ?
kim woo jin and jin hye rin 's kissing scene .
is it ?
and the actors ?
a kissing scene with that moron ?
just thinking about it makes me sick !
min ah , just close your eyes and get over with it , please ?
what else can we do at this point ?
hyung .
do you really have to go that far ?
affawhashiditamelashtime ?
( after what she did to me last time ?
)
afcarshahaftagothishfar .
( of course i have to go this far . )
afcarsh .
( of course . )
if you are ready , you may come out .
from now on , can you play the piano only for me ?
even if i were to betray you ?
even if i were to deceive you ?
could you still play it only for me ?
cut !
ah , min ah , what 's wrong ?
you were doing so well !
go brush your teeth before i throw a fit . [ dropping the honorifics ]
yes , noona .
i knew you 'd say that .
" is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for ? "
" of course , it 's my mom . mrs. park kang ja . "
of course , of course it 's your mom .
who else but your mom ?
by the way , mom ...
what is it ?
there is someone i know ... whose past is so full of pain that he can 't get over it ...
sure , there are people like that .
he wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she 's alive .
does that make him a bad person ?
of course that makes him a bad person .
then why the heck would someone not think of him as a bad person ?
well , that means that someone likes that person .
why ?
is this about you ?
no !
it 's for my drama .
so cold . aunty , i 've come for some grilled mackerels !
oh !
welcome !
and that 's what i told other people , too .
that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as inheritance . that i grew up with a happy childhood .
i 'm ... a big coward ...
what are you thinking about ?
i couldn 't reach you at all all day yesterday .
did something happen ?
nothing really .
you did that back then , too .
five years ago , when you broke up with me and left .
like yesterday , i couldn 't reach you at all all of a sudden . after transforming the rookie actress sung min ah into the goddess of melodramas , you deserted me , leaving as if you were running away .
i 've told you already .
i 've erased all my memories of you .
don 't lie .
though you may not have had started out that way , towards the end , you ended up loving me .
yes , i admit that i did like you .
then , why did you leave ?
you 're an actress who should be loved by everybody . if that 's the only reason , don 't leave me ever again .
episode 14 from dusk till dawn ready , action ! fire !
hye rin ! ahjussi , youcan 'tsleephere ! fire !
cut ! hyun min , what 's wrong ? director !
there 's someone inside !
i said there 's someone inside !
what now ?
eariler there was an extra inside , maybe he wasn 't feeling well .
ahjussi !
that ahjussi earlier with the carrier .
the ahjussi i replaced , i don 't see him anywhere .
the fire truck ?
it should ... arrive soon .
no , representative !
representative !
ahjussi , are you alright ?
come to your senses ! wake up !
we have to get out !
get on my back !
no , director , you can 't !
let go of me .
people getting hurt at my set ...
i can 't just stand around and watch !
representative !
are you alright ?
i 'm alright .
we should worry about that person .
what 's with all of you ?
like people who were wishing that i wouldn 't get out .
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blowing in my direction , it 's killing my eyes .
representative , are you okay ?
i 'm okay .
what about the other person ?
they 're doing first aid for now , his condition seems to be rather severe .
how is his blood pressure ?
180 .
how much ?
97 .
move him to intensive care !
yes .
where is the hospital ?
i have to go there as well .
the director said the actors and staff shouldn 't come .
and just stand by near here .
he will contact us .
what are you thinking about ?
the extra who died on my set on that day , 5 years ago ...
that day comes up again and again in my memory .
5 years earlier .
what do we do ?
!
you bastard !
bring my son back to life !
i 'm telling you to bring him back !
my precious son !
bring him back ...
where are you going ?
for now , don 't look for me .
thenwhataboutmydrama ?
now my drama is finished .
forever .
hm , mom .
did the staff like it ?
they all said it 's really delicious and complimented your cooking skills .
and were really grateful .
yes ? but why does your voice sound so frail ?
but why does your voice sound so frail ?
did something happen ?
no .
work is going well , so don 't worry too much .
don 't get too hung up on the script without sleping , and take it easy .
don 't overwork .
yes , i 'll do that .
hello !
go eun !
mom , i 'll give you a call later on .
kang hyun min .
i was worried ...
how is he ?
he just went into intensive care , we 're all waiting for him to wake up .
actually , i was surprised . i 'm sorry to you for thinking this way , but that you would come here yourself ,
i would never have imagined it .
it 's what i should do .
you must be tired , you can go and wash up .
you don 't have to worry because i 'm here .
writer !
it was my fault .
what ?
what does that ...
i ... saw him . no , no , no .
bit na ... she 's the lead actress , so i have to act with her .
how can we film seperately ?
anyways , i 'm a little busy so i 'll call you later .
i 'm hanging up .
what a scare !
ahjussi !
you can 't sleep here .
hey , bit na , if you 're going to be like this i 'm going to get mad !
got it ?
back then , if i ... had only woken him up ...
no ...
if i had called another person ... it wouldn 't have turned out like that .
don 't blame yourself too much .
you couldn 't have imagined the situation would be like this .
no one could .
even so ... if only i had given it a little thought this wouldn 't have happen .
aigoo .
i fully understand what you 're feeling .
don 't think about it this negatively .
because that man can get up again .
really ?
of course . everyone is praying single-heartedly , so it will turn out well .
so cheer up . kang hyun min style .
my style ?
korea 's top star kang hyun min , your highness ' style .
like brad pitt ?
yes , like brad pitt .
why did you come here ?
he said he came because he was worried .
how is he ?
externally he has minor burns , the problem are internal injuries of the lung .
fotunately the internal injuries are also minor .
go inside , have a look .
he regained consciousness a while ago .
are you feeling alright ?
thank you so much , representative .
if it wasn 't for you ...
i wouldn 't have remained alive .
get well fast .
once this drama is finished , you have to do the ninth drama with us as well .
then . i 'll have to get up fast .
min ah !
they said he 's conscious !
he woke up ?
yes , and there are no major injuries .
ah ... that such a relief .
i 'll be at the car .
take your time to get ready and come out .
okay , got it .
representative , no !
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blowing in my directions , it 's killing my eyes .
representative ! - ah , team leader .
you were looking for me ?
give him enough money for him to get proper treatment until he fully recovers .
yes .
also quickly prepare the compensation so he can receive it soon .
make sure it to be enough , not lacking .
yes , i got it . make sure it to be enough , not lacking .
what ?
ah , nothing .
representative , today ... you were totally cool .
representative , are you alright ?
shouldn 't you be examined as well ?
you don 't look good .
how can i look good ?
i went into a fire pit and came out .
i 'm okay , so don 't worry .
representative kim !
thank you .
now did those 5-year-old memories disperse a little ?
anthony .
you 're a pretty okay producer .
it took you this long to realize that ?
how disappointing .
right .
then i 'm sorry .
now you 'd better get back to the set and finish the shoot .
isn 't it the last scene ?
right .
please look after the situation over here .
hyun min , let 's go !
don 't we have to shoot the last scene ? of course we have to shoot it !
that little bastard kang hyun min has changed quite a lot .
he did , didn 't he ?
but it 's not as much as the change of " someone . "
what are you talking about ?
i 'm talking about " someone " who was the original cold-blooded asshole but now suddenly changed to a nice guy .
tell me .
why did you run into the fire ?
huh ?
everybody was at a loss , not knowing what to do , but why did you run into the fire despite its danger ?
i just went inside .
just like that ?
didn 't you say you sold your soul to the devil ?
kim bong dal .
the soul anthony sold - kim bong dal bought it back , cheaply .
so you have returned .
you as well .
cut !
okay !
we 're done for tonight !
well , today , you all did a great job .
tomorrow there is no shoot , so rest well .
let 's get back to seoul !

be cool and say a word .
all of you , who worked hard in this cold weather . all of you , who worked hard in this cold weather .

gwangsoo !
he 's sure having fun . but ...
i can take care of the actors .. but representative kim you have to take care of writer lee .
actually , among all , writer lee is the one who should take care of her health the most .
if you get sick , it will cause the blank of scripts right away .
well , we were going to leave the room soon , anyway .
what is this ?
what 's with this atmosphere , so awkwardly quiet ?
huh ?
should kang hyun min up the mood ?
what would be good ?
what about ya ja time ?
what a stupid game , ya ja time . anthony , be quiet . ( informally )
are we starting ?
huh ?
hyun min , you , stop acting up like that . ( informally )
hey , min ah , you think i 'll let you off easy because you 're the nuna ?
nuna ( an older sister ) my ass ...
how much longer are you going to pretend to be 27 ?
be honest .
you 're 31 .
how old are you ?
29 .
stop staring , dude .
okay okay ... let 's end it here .
young mok , you be quiet . the adults are talking .
please excuse me .
yes , you can speak now .
oh , representative kim .
the incident was taken care of ?
yes , thankfully everyone is safe and sound .
please tell that to the chief .
umm , that is ..
is something wrong ?
chief nam handed in his resignation .
what ?
his resignation ?
well , it hasn 't been processed yet .
we can talk details when you 're back in seoul .
oh really , then ... ah , it 's been a long time , this is great .
well , did you finish your business refreshingly ( at the restroom ) , director ?
now , i 'm not a director any longer . hey , stop talking formally .
we got hired at the same time .
geez . yes , i understood , director .
you ... come back again .
hey , i just submitted my resignation .
what are you talking about ?
the president hasn 't approved it yet .
you know what kind of a person deputy director kim is .
as soon as you you submitted your resignation , he 's already so busy to put his people in the important positions .
do you think that 's all ? all the dramas with great quality , which you gave the time slots , they are all cancelled now .
woon hyeong , i 'm begging you . to drama department , please come back .
let 's drink .
what are you thinking so hard about ?
no , it 's nothing .
by the way ...
why did you really run in ?
you were the kind of person who worked on the principle of certainty based on numbers .
i 'm just curious if you had such confidence when you ran into the fire .
seriously , why did you run in ?
someone pushed me from behind .
honestly , i don 't know either .
why i did that in that moment .
i want to know .
the more i know you , the better i want to get to know you .
i am brad pitt .
oh , bit na it 'll be hard to see you today . i 'll see you tomorrow , huh ?
that person who got hurt is fine now .
you have to throw a party for him too ?
even so a person i work with came back from the dead .
what am i supposed to do .
so ... now you 're saying that ajusshi is more important than i am ?
that 's not what i 'm saying .
you 're saying you can 't come because some nobody extra got hurt .
what ?
some nobody extra ?
what ?
am i wrong ?
how can you say something like that ?
so rudely ?
what ?
oppa , are you ... mad at me right now ?
be honest , right now you 're drinking and playing with that bitch sung min ah .
what-
fine !
i 'm playing with sung min ah .
i want to play with sung min ah . all night long !
oppa !
do you like that bitch ?
yes i love sung min ah , i love her very much , i love her so very much !
i love you so much sung min ah !
hanging up !
have you gone crazy ?
don 't take this wrong .
i might look crazy now , but ...
don 't come any closer !
that 's not it-
i said don 't come any closer !
no , i mean ...
you !
i 'm warning you .
find someone within your league .
- good morning !
- have you slept well ?
representative isn 't here ?
ah , he had to go to seoul .
ah ... riding on that food truck ?
yes .
i wonder if he 's doing ok with the trip .
oh , you 're here .
yes .
writer lee , let 's go together in my car .
yes .
it 's raining all of a sudden .
this is the first time i 've ridden in a car with a writer like this .
yes .
ah , you said before , that you and representative kim are like an angel and a demon .
ah , before ...
what happened so that he 's called as a demon-like bad producer ?
i 'm just curious if he was different ( to you ) from representative kim whom i know .
frankly speaking , i like representative kim .
no , i mean , two of us used to love each other , so we 're trying to work it out from now on .
i 'm hoping you , writer lee , can help our relationship .
you can tell represenative kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him .
all of you , aren 't you embarrassed to bring me this rating chart ?
cp choi of the daily drama .
yes , deputy director .
why do you think your rating is bad ?
why is such bad ratings happening ?
and , " children of paradise , " make it end within this month . it 's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better .
it 's quality is good and the reaction from viewers is getting better .
quality , potential ... do you think such things will bring more advertisement ?
until when will you wait for the bit-by-bit increasing rating ?
the next drama after " children of paradise ... "
where is cp oh ?
oh , cp oh !
don 't make some trivial one , but something sensational , something stunning ! yes .
listen carefully !
i care about only rating .
rating , rating , rating !
do properly , please !
shall we buy a dog , too ?
no way . i really hate dogs .
- why not ?
we love dogs a lot .
- then , who will take care of it ?
you must be coming back from grocery shopping .
you should say hello . hello !
hello !
oh this kid .
you look a lot like your dad , huh ?
but , who are you ahjussi ?
ah , someone dad works with .
go in , first .
let 's go home .
goodbye .
i 'm sure you 've heard the news , and i have nothing to say to you .
please , just leave .
were you somebody who feels so little responsibility ?
what is your reason ? you tried hard to change all shady dirty tricks by even risking your director position , but now , what on earth is the reason you stepped down from that position ? well , i 'm sorry for not taking responsibility for " morning of kyeongseong " until the end , but i can 't tell you why .
please leave . until i hear that reason , i can 't leave . the director position i got was given not by my competence , but by that shady trick which i despised so much , and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ? and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ?
what do you mean ?
nam gook hyeon , chairman of empire group .
i got the position because of my father 's power .
maybe , that 's why i hated you more , representative kim .
to me , you seemed worse than my father .
i wanted to deny such father , so i have lived , thinking i don 't have a father .
i wanted to hide it until the end if i could .
well , then that 's enough for the reason , isn 't it ?
no .
if that is why ( you resigned ) , it can 't be a reason to me even more .
i also had a family whom i wanted to deny once .
but even so , i didn 't run away from the path i had to go .
you once told me that people like me should disappear from this field .
but in the end , i 'm still here , but you 're leaving .
before you leave , just keep this in your mind .
then , at the end , there will be only dirty people left with shady tricks .
now hyun min , pass the thugs sent by choi , look towards min ah .
hyun min 's face is full of surprise !
that 's right , that 's right !
good ! still in shock , hyun min 's line !
hyun min , what about your line ?
i 'm done with you !
have your way with the shooting snogging your oh-so-beloved sung min ah !
huh ?
um , isn 't she ... yoon bit na of the idol group angels ? yoon bit na of the idol group angels ?
( moron )
let 's take a break for 5 minutes .
yes .
- gwang soo . - yes , hyung .
why didn 't you block her ? even if i had blocked her , you 'd still have gotten slapped .
so unlucky !
to be honest , i like representative kim .
to be more specific , we used to be in love with each other .
and now , we 're trying to get back together .
i 'm hoping that you , writer lee , could help us with that .
once you get to know him , representative kim is quite a catch .
yes ?
where are you ?
why ?
what do you mean " why " ?
did you forget ?
what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
you said you were going to re-sign your contract .
that 's why you 're calling right now ?
is there anything to talk about besides that ?
looks lire you 're at your studio , so i 'll head that way .
no , don 't come .
what ?
i said don 't come , since i 'm going out now .
where are you going ?
do i have to report that to you too ?
mom !
you 're here !
he 's been waiting !
why are you so late ?
i heard that you 're going to sign a contract for 100 episodes .
he 's also promising a lot of money !
well , i 'll leave you two to talk .
i 'll run some errands next door .
how did you know to come here ?
besides the writer 's room , do you have anywhere else to go but here ?
okay , let 's make this contract , writer lee .
i 'll do it later .
what ?
did that ssd production company or whatever contact you again ?
pardon ?
how much ?
how much did they offer you ?
do you think i 'm doing this because of money ?
then what is it ?
don 't forget how much i had to suffer in that bitter cold because of you .
no ... i - i need to read and review the contract , don 't i ?
what now ?
you can 't take your word back , alright ?
alright , i got it !
lee go eun .
yes ?
don 't let me wait too long . hyung , hyung , hyung , hyung , wake up .
wake up !
what is it ?
[ kang hyun min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other ]
gwang soo , how did this happen ?
i guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have informed the reporters .
what day ?
the day when you got slapped by miss yoon bit na .
i 'm done with you now !
have it your way with the shooting snogging that oh-so-beloved sung min ah !
oh my mother , father ... unni , does this even make sense ?
min ah , you should calm down first . calm down , calm down .
i think kang hyun min released these articles on purpose .
he did it because i wasn 't accepting his heart .
would he go that far ?
of course !
a moron like him would easily do this !
unni , you have no idea how much he is into me right now .
really ?
that bad ?
what the heck is representative oh doing , letting these kind of reports get published ?
i know , right ?
really !
representative , miss sung min ah is in a scandal in the reports !
what ?
with whom ?
well , it 's ...
is it anthony ?
what the heck is this ? what the heck is this ?
the report on miss sung min ah 's scandal .
what the heck ?
since when did they get so close ?
no wonder ...
i knew it the moment yoon bit na of angels slapped him .
what ?
slapped him ?
what happened ?
come on , spill it !
we have no time to lose ! well , you should take a look at this .
[ kang hyun min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other according to a mik staff ]
representative , were you aware of it , too ?
what would you like to have ?
hot jamaican blue with extra shot .
espresso .
okay .
what the heck are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
i know very well that you released those reports !
what !
?
take those reports off while i 'm still being civil .
have you lost your mind ?
( informally )
what ! ?
what did you say just now ?
( informally )
you ?
yes , you !
listen carefully . i don 't know exactly how much you like me but i don 't have the slightest interest in you so direct your interest elsewhere and get rid of the articles instantly .
kang hyun min and sung min ah , you both look so great together .
i wish you to continue loving each other in a bashing manner , fighting .
why are you sitting here ?
oh my jesus .. oh my jesus ..
have you read that scandal news about kang hyun min and sung min ah ?
that 's very good .
pardon ?
people will now watch the drama with more interests .
it will help the rating , don 't you think so ?
" children of paradise , " i think i told you to end it earlier than its original plan . well , that 's ...
in case of " children of paradise , " both the production company and its actors are so determined to work for it until the end .
moreover , if it ends earlier , the next drama 's first airdate should be moved up , but its production company is complaining a lot because they 're not ready yet .
production company , production company , production company !
what can you do if you keep kissing the asses of production companies !
?
we , who are on top of the heads of such mere production companies , are the " a " ! " a " ! if we 're the " a , " then we should show what " a " is supposed to be !
yes , that 's right . scheduling the dramas is the own right of us , the broadcasting station , but at the same time , it 's the promise with viewers .
should we change that precious promise with viewers just because the rating is bad , or because its commercial value is bad or not , as if we turn our palm over ? well , as far as i know , you submitted your resignation and left our company , so do you think you have the right to come here ?
yes , i just met president .
as of 5 pm , today , i 'm approved to come back as director of drama department .
deputy director .
thank you for your work . first , for leaving my position because of my personal reason ,
i 'm sincerely sorry .
then , before starting the meeting , let me tell you one thing . that 's right , as our deputy director kim said , we 're the " a. "
but i would appreciate if you remember this point as well .
justice without power is really helpless and vain .
but power without justice is just violence .
now , the era of violence must be ended .
the era of violence must not be repeated .
well , then shall we begin the meeting ?
yes , speaking .
oh , representative kim .
i heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident . i heard there was some hiccup on the shooting schedule because of the fire accident .
wouldn 't there be any problem for our air schedule ?
i don 't think it 's something a jobless person has to concern . listen well ,
i 'm talking to you now as director of drama department .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand , director . everything will go well without any issue .
okay , i will rely on you , representative kim .
i heard you 're reinstated .
yes .
as you see .
what is the reason you changed your mind ?
well , if you hear that , you will be disappointed .
well , there is nothing more to be disappointed about .
yes . this position , that 's right , not by my competence but by your power , father , by unjust method , it 's given to me .
even if i didn 't know that , it 's also my fault .
but , just quitting isn 't solving everything , and i should do my best in this very position to not let this drama field rot , to not let this drama go back to the past dirty way .
i thought that is very important .
well , times have changed , i guess .
i will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change .
representative ...
what ?
let 's think about warm things .
for me , it 's baked sweet potatoes .
the first thing coming in your mind is that cheap baked sweet potato ?
what 's wrong with baked sweet potatoes ?
if you 're not careful enough , your mouth will get burnt .
you have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot .
miss , would you like a sweet potato ?
no thank you , i 'm fine .
please keep selling many .
no . no , lee go eun .
don 't think useless thoughts .
concentrate on the script .
concentrate for the waiting viewers of your drama .
okay , you can do it ! aja aja ! lee go eun , fighting !
who is it ?
it 's me .
what are you doing , not opening the door ?
what 's the matter ?
have you made a decision ?
what decision ?
renewing the contract .
is that why you came ?
no .
because of this . no . because of this .
you said you wanted to eat roasted sweet potatoes .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes .
i remember .
don 't misunderstand .
i didn 't do this because of the contract renewal and i didn 't do it for some other ulterior motive either .
honestly , i just bought them when i saw the street vendor selling them nearby , so just enjoy .
eat it before it gets cold . i 'm leaving .
i don 't even believe in myself sometimes but i believe in you .
you 're not ... crying , right ?
no , the two of us , we used to love each other , and now , we 're thinking of working it out .
because of this .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shivering that you wanted to eat sweet potatoes .
what ?
do they taste bad ?
why do you confuse people ?
what ?
you 're dating sung min ah , why are you being like this to me ?
dating sung min ah ?
who ?
what do you mean , " who " ?
you are .
why would that person give me sweet potatoes ?
who said i was dating sung min ah ?
eh ?
i don 't know where you heard that strange rumor no , i guess you 're saying that because you saw me with sung min ah here before .
i don 't have such feelings for whomever , so you don 't have to be concerned .
well , it 's not that i 'm concern about that but ...
that is ... and , if somebody buys you sweet potato , are you always confused ?
what are you confused about ?
no ...
well , this ... if this is from china or from domestic ... i was confused ...
that is ... do you by chance like me ?
then again , that would never happen .
representative .
what ?
episode 15 we have crossed the rubicon do you like me by any chance ? but then , there is no way you would .
representative . what ? n--no , it 's nothing .
so silly . right ! i like you !
i said i like you .
i must be crazy , i 'm crazy .
i 'm not in my right mind .
i like you !
i said i like you .
hyung , what are you waiting for ?
just tell her like a man !
easier said than done .
i just can 't work up the courage .
that 's why you need to get brave .
just make up your mind and walk up to her ...
walk up to what ?
you have arrived .
pd joo , what is it ?
something wrong ?
no , nothing .
actually , joo pd ...
spill it , goo hee jae .
what is it ? pd joo fell in love .
what ?
love ?
yes . the moment he saw the youngest fd of the directing team , he fell for her .
joo pd .
yes .
are you in your right mind ?
eh ?
do you think i pay you just so you could chase chicks at the filming site ?
what kind of a production pd doesn 't separate his private life from his work ?
tell me .
are you really dating kang hyun min ?
i don 't know about it .
if you really want to know , you could go ask that moron yourself .
i need to go for more shooting . min ah , either anthony or kang hyun min , the way i see it , your taste in men is really low .
what ?
you know it . our hyun min is so gentle and considerate , which could cause such rumors with miss sung min ah , but ... hyung , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
representative choi ! red long johns , red pants !
what 'cha doin ' ?
- just shut up already !
ah , at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
yes , then , i 'm hanging up .
i was just explaining to the reporter about your rumor !
ah , you were being interviewed ?
yes . you should have said so then .
hyung !
how can you hang up so rudely when it was such an important call ?
they 're only going to get more suspicious !
what exactly do you do for me as my representative ?
do you even know that my korean beef endorsement contract is about to expire ?
don 't worry , they 're coming this afternoon .
really ?
i 'm warning you .
stop staring at me .
i 'm out of your league , so give up and just concentrate on your drama .
ah well , with your unrequited love and endorsements ... you 're busider than a bee , no wonder you 'd forget about the drama .
what ?
unrequited love ?
busier than a bee ?
hyung !
is there a bee farm around here ?
why did it fail ?
hey ! isn 't " morning in kyeongseong " a total hit ?
i know !
hyun min oppa is so amazing in that one !
but , i 'm not sure about the recent episodes .
why ?
think about it . jin hye rin told kim woo jin that she loves him and whatever .
they even kissed !
and now she 's going to betray him ?
what 's up with that ?
that 's true .
that doesn 't make sense .
roasted sweet potatoes , chips , ramyun ...
such a childish appetite you have .
don 't you care about staying in shape ?
are you listening to me ?
yes .
your mother is at your studio , so get going .
mom ?
it 's delicious .
aigoo , it already started !
you 're watching it again ?
of course ! i 'm watching all the reruns , too .
is it that fun ?
of course .
whose daughter wrote it , after all ?
gosh , why is he like that again ?
go eun ... that jin hye rin , is she betraying kim woo jin after all ?
no .
actually , this will be revealed much later , but she 's not really betraying him .
she 's pretending to betray him because there 's no other way , but she 's really helping kim woo jin .
oh , it was like that ?
had i known that , i wouldn 't have been cursing her .
my daughter is amazing !
you are a genius , genius !
it 's starting .
now , let 's hear from mr. kang hyun min 's management staff . as you know , our hyun min is so gentle and considerate , that it causes such misunderstandings ... but at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
why , what are you doing ?
representative choi ! - just shut up already !
your voice came out also .
how embarrassing ...
like this , the management is denying the rumor , but reports of witnesses who saw the two actors dating at a cafe or at the filming studio keep surfacing , prompting the possibility of another celebrity couple being in the making , which is a hot potato in the world of entertainment gossip currently .
ah , seriously !
celebrity couple in the making ?
i told them no ! why don 't they believe me ?
! that 's why you should have been more firm !
my cf , my money is here !
i 've been really enjoying " morning in kyeongseong " lately . ah , speaking of which ,
how about doing it with miss sung min ah this time as a couple ?
judging from the drama , the two of you really look great and work well together .
i 've been doing this by myself for 3 years , why would i do it with sung min ah now ?
well , it is the wish of the sponsor .
send the sponsor my message clearly : either i , kang hyun min , do it by myself ,
he will never be able to do it with someone else .
i won 't do it !
oh , you know , right ?
that scandal ... is total nonsense .
of course , i know it better than anybody .
did you want to see me to talk about that ?
no . there is someone i 'd like you to meet .
ah , there he comes .
say hello to the chief director of taesan group , kim sang jik .
i 'm anthony kim .
nice to meet you .
a production company ?
yes .
our company is going to create the largest production company in asia .
we would like you to be the ceo of that company .
we 'll offer you the highest salary in the industry as well as 10 % of the shares .
what do you think ? although , right now , you are the representative of a small production company , for someone who had once created the legend of empire , this is a matching offer , i think .
i 'm sorry , but i will decline .
why ?
are you passing up this exceptional offer ? of course , it is an attractive offer , but however , i don 't want to work under other people any more .
in thinking about our entertainment group , it 's not only into drama but includes management .
this first management contract will be with sung min ah .
if you confirm , then we will move immediately .
it 's here .
you said that you wanted to make the world 's best production , right ?
why don 't you make it , starting from here ?
every year , i will invest $ 40 million into world production .
of course , the owner will be anthony kim .
as long as we get 49 % of the shares .
what do you think ? this offer ?
exactly what is the reason you are offering me this deal ? it 's because creating a company which exceeds empire is our goal . also , the person who created the empire 's myth is you , anthony , is it not ?
i will accept . you have made the right decision !
we will complete the operating details and
i will take it as a confirmed contract .
then ...
you are finally able to achieve your dream . watching you succeed , while watching you , is also the dream that i hoped for .
♫ because your two eyes are far away , i only see you .
♫ because my heart is frozen , i 'm hugging you . ♫ when your trembling lips touch my ears , ♫ while i dreamed only of you to say the words i love you .
the person who created empire 's myth is exactly you , anthony , is it not ?
you said that you wanted to make asia 's best production did you not ?
why don 't you go ahead and try making it ?
of course , the owner is you , anthony kim .
that 's right .
the time has come .
bong dal representative , it 's me .
i 'm in the middle of a meeting . i 'm busy , so hang up .
from this moment on , i will start my own drama again .
i think i said that i was in the middle of a meeting .
i 'm busy , so hang up .
if you hang up this time , i 'm not going to leave you be .
what are taking my word for ?
i 'm busy right now but because of you ....
you said you were a busy person .
you said you were in the middle of a meeting .
exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck ?
until a few moments ago , i was busy with the meeting .
but what are you trying to say ?
by tomorrow morning , please gather the " morning in kyeongseong 's " crew .
gather ?
it 's something more important than anything .
understand ?
so , you 're going to fix the uploaded episodes 11 and 12 ?
yes , i wanted to show more of the love between the two characters .
up to now , only in episode 13 , it is realized that hye rin came to help woo jin .
and then , it was my idea that hye rin 's character would be seen as nearly sinister .
because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice .
so you will modify episode 11 by accelerating the content of episode 13 ?
yes . with that change , i think it will be possible to see the audience rooting for the two characters .
but , can you amend the screenplay in less than four days ?
i can do it .
it 's not something to be dealt with by talking . you have a point there to put the story together , but it 's a big risk .
if that is to happen , we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before .
hyun min , what do you think ?
huh ?
do it like that .
she says she can do it , so why don 't we try believing writer lee ?
is it not unimagineable , too difficult and are there problems every day ?
can you really do the script in four days ?
yes . i can do it .
fine . if writer lee says she can do it , then i will wait .
then , take care of yourself .
let 's see how well you can do .
bye .
the writer says she can do it , so why don 't we trust her once ?
i mean , that 's living .
that fox !
we 're in a state of emergency now .
i know . even if you manage to rewrite the script for 2 episodes , what comes after that is the problem .
for the following episodes , even if there is a problem in the script , we still have to shoot it without changing a thing .
i 'm fully aware of it .
you have to keep this in mind , that the decision you just made , put " morning in kyeongseong " on a path of no return .
like julius caesar who marched toward rome in b.c. 49 , we have crossed the rubicon river .
let them find out at this point ... and make a powerful ending ...
it 's unlocked . since we 're in a state of emergency , we have to save the time for sleep as well as food .
naturally , until you 're done with the revision , you can 't leave the studio .
so , what are all these ? multivitamins , red ginseng extract , omega-3 for improving circulation , and this is yogurt , good for constipation .
if you 're sitting in one place too long , you get constipated .
since your physical health is top priority , make sure to take them .
and what is that ? toothpaste , shampoo , and lotion .
also , since i don 't know what you use , i just bought one of each kind .
why , you don 't use the ones with wings ?
i bought them because they cost 1500 won more .
you 're a man , representative .
isn 't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman ?
i 'm not a man , but a producer . you 're not a woman , but a writer .
i 'll put these away and sit here , so call me if you need anything .
what ?
you 're not leaving ?
why would i leave ?
you 're not writer kim soo hyun .
what , are you sleepy already ?
no , nothing .
yes , i understand .
then , we will meet next week and discuss .
make an appointment with the production company , please .
yes , yes , good work .
by the way , director ...
there 's barely enough time for shooting , how can they revise the script now ? how about this , hiring a more experienced writer to help writer lee go eun ...
why don 't we trust writer lee go eun and wait ? seriously , director , she 's a rookie , how can we just trust and wait ?
why , didn 't you call her another writer kim soo hyun ?
well , that ..
after continuing 10 more years ..
listen , director lee ...
eh ?
just ... just , just ...
uh , director .
director ...
what do we do hyun min ?
why ? what 's the problem ?
i just heard from the korean beef commercial .
tthe sponsor says , if you don 't do it with sung min ah , he 'd choose another couple .
what ?
!
like who ? i guess they 're trying to contact jang dong gun and go so young .
jang dong gun and go so young ?
( a married couple of superstars )
miss sung min ah ...
i think i warned you , not to stare at me .
let 's talk for a moment .
i don 't have anything to talk about with you .
it 's only for a moment .
it 's a very important thing .
so , let me get this straight .
you want us to be in a korean beef commercial as a couple ?
i 'm not interested . look for someone else .
don 't take this wrong .
i don 't want to be in a commercial with you , miss sung min ah .
then why are you asking to do it together ?
well , you could call it the responsibility of the leading actor ...
besides , why are you so selfish , miss sung min ah ?
what ?
when writer lee is working so hard , are you just going to sit there and do nothing ?
when we do a commercial as a couple , it will also promote more awareness of our drama ... stop that nonsense , and tell me the real reason .
ah man , really ...
money .
can 't you just do it this once ?
i 'll do anything you ask .
fine , but i have one condition .
do a tv interview in person , mr. kang hyun min , that we 're not in a relationship .
also , release news reports to clarify the rumors .
just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us .
can you promise to do that ?
deal .
then , me too .
deal !
do you think this makes sense ?
why doesn 't it ?
kim woo jin gives up his lifelong dream and goes to rescue jin hye rin ?
what a nonsense !
he loves her that much ! of course he 'd rush to save jin hye rin , leaving everything behind .
what idiot gives up his dream for love ?
how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ? how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ? how can you make kim woo jin into a fool just to save the character of jin hye rin ?
if he loves her to death , why wouldn 't he ? in case you haven 't noticed , humans are innately selfish .
in case you haven 't noticed , humans are innately selfish .
they cry when they 're hungry , and they smile when they 're full .
have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ?
how can you not understand this ?
unlike your elementary unrequited crushes , i have had lots of experience .
how many ? like what ?
kissing and sleeping together .
you mean , doing those is love ?
what else is there to it ?
uh , so low !
yes , i 'm a third-rate lowlife .
but you don 't even have that experience .
ah , whatever .
i got it . let 's stop this conversation now .
i 'll just write the script . i 'll just write the script .
sure , you write the script .
i 'll make a trip to the office .
you still seem to think that you 're right .
but admit it , you 're wrong .
just go already !
your son looks really amazing .
producing a great drama like that .
you must be really proud of him .
he should find a good woman before i pass on .
he 's not married yet ?
i even wonder if he ever liked someone ?
because of the hardships he had to endure , he only knows to pretend to be strong .
he doesn 't know how to open up his heart to someone .
i see .
if he had been born to good parents , he could have had a happy life ... what are you doing , not writing the script ?
it 's a movie i must watch for the script .
love letter ?
yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
why would you watch it again then ?
well , to get into the emotional mood , i have to watch it even for 101st time !
it 's all because you 've never been in love that you 're watching something like this .
stop nagging like that .
i 'm going to watch it anyway .
are you doing well ?
i 'm doing fine !
you 're supposed to make others cry , not cry yourself .
are you doing well ?
( in japanese ) are you doing well ?
is that sad ?
please stop crying so ugly .
you 're disturbing the person next to you .
it 's sad but really beautiful , right ?
no ?
eh ?
about what ? after a long time has passed , she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book .
even the title of the book is " in search of lost time . "
i read that book so many times even ...
i mean it . you were never in true love , representative .
have you ever even shed tears for love ? because my eyes are blinded , all i can see is you because my heart is frozen , i wrap my arms around you when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , my heart , that had been dreaming of only you ...
because my eyes are blinded , all i see is you , because my heart is frozen ,
i wrap my arms around you .
when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , anthony , are you crazy ?
this is nonsense .
how can that tomboy look so pretty in my eyes ?
are the terms of the contract ok ?
- both kang hyun min and sung min ah agree ... so i don 't think it 'll be a problem .
don 't we need to hear what writer lee go eun thinks ?
shall we call her ?
well then , representative ...
um , representative ?
huh ?
oh , what did you say ?
ah , so cold .
it 's too cold !
it wakes me right up !
seriously .
it 's cold !
yes , chief director .
i 'm calling because the chairman would like to meet you in person and discuss the contract .
how about friday evening ?
that 's fine . i 'll see you then .
alright , we 'll decide on the time and place and contact you again .
yes , good bye .
the door is open , what are ... wait , why am i doing this ?
stop this , anthony . i 'm a producer , and she 's a writer .
i guess the others haven 't come in yet ?
why ?
here 's the revised draft of the script .
what do you think ?
it 's good .
well done .
cut !
ok !
the revised draft makes it so much easier to empathize !
the starting point isn 't too bad . pd joo , what are you doing ? !
what is the viewership rating for today ?
19.8 % .
it went up 2.1 % from the day before !
yeah !
ah , good job everyone .
" morning in kyeongseong " soars even higher as the truth behind jin hye rin 's betrayal is revealed
" morning in kyeongseong " leads the viewership rating for 6 weeks in a row , going over 20 %
as the romance of kang hyun min and sung min ah develop , " morning in kyeongseong " keeps its lead .
lately , the viewership rating has been soaring up impressively .
well , i don 't concern myself too much over the viewership ratings .
the only thing that i 'm interested in is the love from you .
actually , there is a rumor that all your attention is focused on a specific person , causing the numerous fans of mr. kang hyun min to watch " morning in kyeongseong " in jealousy .
today , we 'd like to hear the truth .
the rumor with miss sung min ah , is it really just a rumor ?
today , until you give us an answer about the rumor , i won 't let you go .
ah , just answer him , you moron !
miss sung min ah , right .
she 's a great actress .
she 's a good actor and a good person . i can swear over my family , sadly , it is only a rumor .
we 're not dating .
you 're not dating .
however , you may count on the kim woo jin that is acting with miss sung min ah . the promise made with my pride as an actor at stake ,
i must keep for sure .
ensure the health of the hubby with korean beef ?
newlywed couple style ?
more like an arranged marriage .
are you kidding me ?
hello .
today 's shooting is about a newlywed couple .
ah , i see .
did you get a botox shot ?
what ?
well , you look somewhat different .
chu ~ ?
it 's delicious .
take care of your husband 's physical health with korean beef .
korean beef !
i just visited hoengseong recently .
[ hoengseong : famous town for korean beef ]
i count on you to promote more awareness about korean beef .
what 's with that face ?
you got money and korean beef !
isn 't this awesome ?
ah , what a pathetic bum .
pathetic bum ?
do you think i 'm just doing this for the money ? even anthony and writer lee , for the drama , are working on the script together .
then we , also for the drama , could shoot commercials and promote our drama !
they 're working on the script together ?
didn 't you know ? all day long , they 're stuck together like this , working on the script , i think .
i told you not to skip the supplements .
you caught a cold because you 're not physically fit .
thirty minutes after a meal .
i 'll make sure to take them this time .
don 't smile .
you grow on me .
my studio isn 't that far .
i can just walk ...
it 's because i 'm cold .
hello ?
it 's me , min ah .
( wait over there for a moment )
yes .
are you busy ?
well , busy as usual .
then , can you get out for a moment ?
i have something to tell you , and i 'm free this evening .
alright .
alright .
i 'll see you then .
we 're going to relocate our office .
the office ?
yes , to a much bigger place .
is it something miss sung min ah helped you with ?
she introduced me to a company that wants to invest in our shares .
yes . once the contract goes smoothly tomorrow , i 'll get you a new studio with a better view , so you can prepare for the next project .
with sung min ah as the lead .
with miss sung min ah as the lead actress ?
that was their condition .
so stop beating around the bush and putting off your contract renewal , and let 's renew your contract .
yes .
it couldn 't have been easy for a rookie writer to change the course of the storyline in the middle .
you must have really helped her a lot , representative .
of course . she couldn 't have come this far without my help .
speaking of which , i 'd like to let lee go eun write our next project , too .
what do you think ?
well , if the script is good , i have nothing against it .
sure .
ah , you know what 's tomorrow , right ?
the contract with the chairman of taesan group .
yes , at 6pm in cheongdamdong , i heard .
since you 'll meet him for the first time , it would be good to talk over dinner .
so i asked them to meet there .
you used to like the restaurants there . also , tomorrow , i 'll also expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me you forgot ?
can you tell me that you don 't have any feelings for me ?
then , stop telling me to forget .
once we start again , there won 't be any reason for us to break up ever again .
min ah , i 'll wait .
also , tomorrow , i 'll expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me , you forgot .
your vision got blurry all of a sudden , and you felt dizzy ?
yes .
did you have a lot of stress lately , or did you overwork yourself ?
what man in korea doesn 't live like that ?
then , are you taking any drugs for long term ?
i 've been taking an antidepressant for about 3 years now .
three years ... then , have you had these symptoms before that ? no , it never happened before , only recently , about twice .
we 'll know more after you get a thorough physical exam and get the results back .
at this point , it seems like a side effect of the antidepressant .
cut !
okay !
we 'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes !
gwang soo , phone .
gwang soo ? so , over that pretty faced fd chick , the two of you are having a mental race ?
yes . gwang soo , in order to capture the heart of a lady ; first , you have to show her your own sexy smile often .
smile .
smile .
director ? look at sung min ah , she 's so stunned .
but if i keep sending her the same smile over and over , someday she 'll ask .
ask what ?
why do you smile like that whenever you see me ?
and then ?
then , you need to say an impactful , short , and concise phrase that will seduce her .
your eyes make me smile .
eww , it 's so cheesy !
i feel nauseous .
did you take your pills ?
you 're here ?
i said did you take your medicine ?
yes .
how 's your fever ?
i think it went down .
stop writing the script for today and rest .
no i 'm fine .
i have to hurry and write and turn in the script for episode 13 , so i can 't rest .
don 't argue and just go to the hospital .
go and get another shot .
yeah .
it 's me , min ah .
did you leave yet ?
soon .
i 'm also leaving in a few , so don 't be late .
the ceo is sensitive to timeliness .
don 't worry .
or , shall we meet up and go together ?
lee go eun .
lee go eun !
lee go eun !
stay conscious !
hello ? representative !
lee go eun !
get up .
what ?
what 's is it ?
no , it 's nothing ...
i think we have to leave now .
oh ... ok ... i got it ... lee go eun , stay focused .
you 're here , president ?
oh , it 's been a long time .
there must be a lot of traffic .
yes . a little .
why don 't we order first , president ?
yes , let 's do so .
hold on , lee go eun .
we 're almost at the hospital , so hang in there !
where is she hurting ?
she had an oncoming cold this afternoon , and right now she has a really bad fever .
she overworked for a few days ...
how is it ?
her temperature is 40.8 .
she must 've been in a lot of pain ...
prepare her some fever reducer . yes .
i think we need to wait until her fever cools down .
are you conscious now ?
what happened ?
what do you mean what happened ?
your fever went over 40 and you fainted .
if it hurts you should 've said so .
what are you doing here ?
what about the contract ?
hurry up and go .
did you forget who was here today ?
how could you throw away such an important contract ?
i 'm sorry
there was a situation .
what situation ?
what problem is greater than your dream , your future ?
was writer lee go eun such an important person to you ?
why can 't you answer ?
is writer lee go eun so important to you ?
that 's right .
lee go eun is an important person to me .
i finally realized it .
that lee go eun ... is such an important person to me .
[ preview ] about when kim woo jin goes to save jin hye rin ...
i think you 're right .
you have a guy , don 't you ?
is it kim bong dal ?
if you bother writer lee one more time , i swear to god .
kang hyun min is all over the place .
i only saw his foot acting .
am i that bad at acting ?
do you honestly think my acting is that bad ?
have you ever put effort into acting ?
what are you doing tonight ?
we have to sign a contract .
why are we writing a contract on christmas eve ?
... but why does my vision get cloudy at times ?
how would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound ?
episode 16 in search of lost time i 'm sorry . something came up .
what came up ? what can possibly be more important than your dream and your future ? is writer lee go eun that important to you ?
why aren 't you answering ? i asked if writer lee go eun is that important to you . that 's right .
lee go eun is a very important person to me .
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go eun .
how dear she is to me .
i 'm sorry .
excuse me , the person that was here , where did she go ?
ah , she was discharged earlier .
lee go eun ! lee go eun , snap out of it !
lee go eun !
are you alright ?
if you were sick , you should have told me so !
are you feeling better now ?
what happened with the contract ?
it went well .
it 's a relief .
yes , it 's a relief .
get some rest .
by the way , about kim woo jin rescuing jin hye rin . pardon ?
i think you 're right .
yes , this is anthony .
i was just wondering about calling you , too ... don 't worry . i heard that the writer was critically ill .
is she doing alright ?
yes , she is , but how did you ... ?
i heard from miss sung min ah .
the chairman is also impressed by your devoted care of your writer , and does not want to miss the opportunity of working with you .
we 'll make another appointment soon for the contract .
thank you ! bye !
bye !
[ a k ]
the person you called is not available .
connecting to the voicemail ...
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go eun .
how dear she is to me .
good news !
another commercial offer .
this time , it 's for a painkiller .
miss sung min ah is in agony because of a bad headache , and tada ~ i appear to hand you the pills .
listen carefully ...
from now on until i die , i won 't ever do another commercial with you , mr. kang hyun min .
got it ?
what 's up with her ?
does she not like it because it 's painkillers ?
i like it .
" meltaway q ! "
thank you .
thanks to you , the contract will be fine .
good for you .
also ... your feelings for writer lee go eun , i understand . working together for some time can bring the two of you closer , and you can grow on each other .
however , even after the drama is over , will your feelings stay the same ?
i won 't be impatient .
when the time comes , i 'll be able to hear the answer .
are you sure you were sick ?
yes . i was really , really sick .
did you see a doctor ?
of course i did !
aigoo , if you were that sick , you should have called me .
how could you go see a doctor by yourself ?
no , i didn 't go alone .
with whom ?
well , with ... a person ?
a person ?
who exactly ?
ah , mom , i 'm eating !
you ... have a man , right ?
no !
lee go eun got a man !
who is it ?
who ?
is it that kim bong dal guy ?
oh , no !
my tummy might get upset !
aren 't you writer lee 's mother ?
omo , if it isn 't the representative !
where are you going ?
i fixed some food for go eun , and now i 'm on my way home .
i 'll give you a ride then .
get in .
no , well , you don 't have to .
the day is too cold for you to walk .
please get in .
have you been doing well lately ?
what is there to do well ?
just being busy with my livelihood , not even noticing my own daughter getting sick .
but , by any chance , representative , do you know kim bong dal ?
kim bong dal ?
yes .
but why are you curious about that person ? well , it seems like my go eun is interested in him , but she wouldn 't tell me anything .
but , representative , is it a person you know ? well , yes , i never got to meet him in person , but i heard that he has a good reputation and his future seems bright .
according to what i 've heard , he even has good looks .
then , take care .
when you 're not too busy , come in for a meal .
yes .
thanks for the ride .
then , you should get back .
no , i 'll see you get in first and then take off .
ah , don 't worry about me and just get back .
then , i 'll see you again later .
aigoo , did he take something wrong ?
where did his manners come from ?
that 's so not like him at all !
i think the grand prize for best actor should go to shin ha gyoon . his acting was good , and , more importantly , the viewership ratings were excellent .
in terms of viewership ratings , kang hyun min is a good contender , too .
though his acting is nothing out of the ordinary , but he 's scheduled for another sbc drama next year .
the grand prize for best actor should go to a good actor .
yes , i understand both of your positions , but how about jang joo sung ?
what , jang joo sung ?
yes . yes , well , the viewership ratings were low , but just looking at acting alone , he was the best this year .
listen , m broadcasting is giving it to cha seung won , and k broadcasting is giving it to park shin yang .
yet , we 're going to give it to an obscure , aged actor ?
it 's the grand prize after all , it should go to a star with some clout . it 's not an award of appreciation .
it 's not an award of appreciation .
yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. jang to receive it ? yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. jang to receive it ?
it literally is the grand prize for best actor .
regardless of starship or viewership rating , but solely looking at the acting performance , right ? well , director , let 's take things with a grain of salt .
the awarding ceremony for the grand prize is another tv show .
it is another competition for viewership ratings .
besides , we have to discuss this matter with the variety department as they 're preparing the ceremony .
so , director nam , you should pay attention to our opinions , too , this time .
yes , i understand .
then , we shall continue this discussion in our next meeting .
i 'll come back again .
take care of yourself .
cut !
ok !
now , let 's eat before going to the next scene !
then , we 'll resume shooting in an hour .
have a good meal !
does a top star have to eat at such an open place ?
there are no good restaurants around here .
have you watched " morning in kyeongseong " this week ?
of course .
kang hyun min was practically flying in his action scenes .
all i could see of kang hyun min was his sucky acting .
that 's true .
my eyes are all for min ah noona .
how could you even notice kang hyun min ? hey , isn 't that kang hyun min over there ?
over there .
he is !
he 's good looking .
he does look superb . for real !
don 't miss your classes .
only kang hyun min . um , hyung , is sung min ah even prettier than on screen ?
yes .
make-up does wonders .
what ?
it 's sung min ah .
whoa !
sung min ah !
hyung , do it quick , hurry !
sung min ah is leaving !
i 'd like to get an autograph , too .
ah , yes .
by the way , what is your name , young man ?
brad pitt .
alright , one person at a time .
what is your name ?
- park sung hoon !
gwang soo ?
from now on , we should always eat in front of an all-girls highschool .
i was thinking of preparing red ginseng as presents for the broadcasting companies for this season .
what ?
red ginseng ?
red ginseng my bum .
that doesn 't suit the scale of the empire .
prepare imported wine . top notch grade .
yes . understood .
what ?
red ginseng ?
present red ginseng to the broadcasting companies with seasonal greetings ?
yes , i think that would be appropriate .
are you in your right mind ?
we don 't have money for that !
you may leave .
yes . ah , pd joo ,
yes .
bring me the cvs of the writers with whom we have contracts .
our ... writers ?
the only writer that has a contract with us is just writer lee .
yes , bring hers .
why do you want her cv all of a sudden ?
do i have to explain that to you ?
no .
sorry , i was too busy .
i sincerely apologize .
but i don 't think i can come to the christmas reunion this year , either , because i have to work on my script .
i guess you guys will have fun without me . yes , but instead ,
i 'll treat you generously next year after the drama is done .
alright .
see you next year .
yes .
her hobby is to watch movies , specialty is tae ... official 4th degree black belt in taekwondo ... favorite food is grilled mackerels and ... roasted sweet potatoes .
favorite movie is love letter . love letter ... yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
it 's really sad , but really beautiful at the same time .
don 't you agree ?
are you fine ?
( in japanese )
i 'm fine .
man , that scared me .
what a shock .
don 't you know how to knock ?
i did knock , but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered .
at any rate , why have you come here ?
to get some printer paper .
what were you watching , anyway ?
none of your concern .
ah , i think i know .
you know what ?
well , what men normally watch .
steamy stuff .
that 's not it .
i know men watch it quite often .
it 's ok .
i said that 's really not it .
oh , that 's love letter !
yes , it 's love letter !
i thought you didn 't like this movie ?
just to review my japanese .
that 's all .
but your japanese is excellent . superb .
to learn the dialect of kobe . their accent .
my eyes were too busy watching min ah noona .
how could you even notice kang hyun min ?
hyung ?
when is the sbc drama awards ceremony ?
the 31st . why ?
let 's see ... possible contenders for the grand prize of best actor are ... me ... me ...
there 's only me !
no way . there 's shin ha gyoon .
ah , that 's right .
ha gyoon hyung .
ah , the brain ...
shin ha gyoon of the brain is too strong ...
can 't let that happen .
at this point , i need an impactful scene that will set this kang hyun min apart for sure ! hyung , you just said that the new script is out , right ? hyung , when jin hye rin is bawling her eyes out at the end here , what if i did that ?
you ?
the viewers will be totally awed !
hyung , tell gwang soo to get the car ready .
well , gwang soo has been rather busy lately .
what ?
busy ?
the personal assistant is busier than the actor ?
well , that 's not what i mean ...
let 's just go the two of us today .
i understand .
however , take the wage for today out of gwang soo 's payment for the month .
take it out !
the closer you are , the more clearcut you have to be with money .
isn 't that right , bumblebee ?
you 're going to the military service soon ?
yes , i just got my draft notice .
please take good care of our hyun min hyung . unlike what appears on tv , there are many surprising things about hyung .
yes , i heard from representative choi that he requires a lot of extra care .
actually , hyun min hyung does not like to read the script .
so , when he 's playing videogames , you have to read it out loud to him .
also , when hyung chooses a drama , he prefers melodrama .
it 's because melodramas bring more commerical endorsement offers for the male lead .
that 's what he believes .
the more i think about it , the more it doesn 't make sense .
how can a drama not have the aspect of melodrama ?
gwang soo .
when there is an appointment , he makes sure to be later than the other actor . his sense of pride is strong , so he thinks that to wait for someone is to lose .
what ?
sung min ah is very punctual with her schedule ?
i told you to go slow , gwang soo . lastly , he may say preposterous things sometimes , but you should just agree with him .
he may not be that bright , but he 's a good hyung .
ah , hey ...
jin hye rin , kim woo jin .
i need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum ...
who is it ?
writer lee !
writer lee !
open the door !
open !
merry christmas , a present for you .
what is it this time ?
just take it , it 's really just a christmas present , nothing more .
omo ! the size is perfect , and they 're really pretty !
thank you !
now that you received my gift , shall we cut to the chase ?
that 's not possible !
why not ?
this drama is for kang hyun min , and this kang hyun min wants to bawl his eyes out .
kim woo jin is shot , and jin hye rin embraces him and cries .
yes , but instead of jin hye rin , kim woo jin can cry !
tears of a man .
how innovating is that ?
well , i suppose it could be innovating , but sung min ah is better ...
she is better what ?
ah , well , what i mean is ..
kim woo jin gets shot in jin hye rin 's place and is bleeding ...
i don 't know !
i don 't know !
i don 't know about that .
just keep in mind that this is the third time .
third time for me to ask you to change something .
i ended up swimming in the ocean and kissing that sung min ah . humanly speaking , if i scratch your back , you should scratch my back , too . give and take .
i warn you . if you don 't change it this time , i won 't go easy on you .
i sent off the new script to the printing office .
i 'll be stopping at writer lee 's studio to drop something off before going home .
yes , i see .
wait .
yes ?
i 'll just take it to her . i need to talk with her anyway .
you , representative ?
what 's with that look on your face ?
why , is it something heavy ?
hyung .
i heard about everything .
you 're going to serve in the military ?
yes . i got the draft notice unexpectedly .
i 'm sorry .
i 've come to say my last good bye .
stay in good health , hyung .
gwang soo .
i bought it myself from the grocery store .
hyung ! hyung , thank you for everything , in 2 years from now , i 'll be back in better shape .
yes , i 'll be waiting .
take care .
gwang soo !
take good care of yourself !
i mean , does that even make sense ?
he wants to do the crying scene of jin hye rin ?
at any rate , what should i do ?
he won 't get over it easily this time .
who is it ?
it 's me .
why are you here ?
this .
pd joo told me to bring it to you .
ah . so you came all the way here just to bring this to me ?
well ... thats right ...
is the script going well ?
yes .
ah , what should i do ?
what ?
mr. kang hyun min came by earlier , and ...
what did hyun min want ?
but , why are you here , representative ?
did you see writer lee go eun earlier today ?
did writer lee say that ?
she 's such a snitch .
well , about that sobbing scene , don 't you think it would be better if kim woo jin did the crying ?
hmm ...
kim woo jin crying ?
you sure are professional , understanding my gist right away . well , at the awards ceremony at the end of the year ,
ha gyoon hyung and i are strong candidates for the grand prize for best actor .
if i were to show an impactful scene at this point , i might be able to secure the award !
how 's that ? okay , so you want the script to be revised so that you 'd do the crying instead ?
exactly that !
do you think you can do that ?
huh ?
you only got this far by pure dumb luck .
with your pathetic acting skills , do you really think you can do that ?
are you done joking with me ?
nope , i 've still got a lot more to say .
do you know yourself ? your script analysis is emelentary level , you don 't even know how poor your acting is , you 're the world 's biggest idiot there ever was ! as such , when the script comes out , don 't even change one thing about it , and just read it properly !
got it ? but ... i said , do you understand !
what 's up with him ?
why is he like that to me ?
yes , i just saw hyun min .
you saw him ?
what did he say ?
didn 't he throw a fit ?
nope .
i talked to him with reason , and he accepted it with no problem .
really ?
yes . he 'll do according to the script .
is that true ?
he even said he 's sorry for bothering you . is that true ? he even said he 's sorry for bothering you .
that 's a relief .
i mean , you 're really amazing , representative .
you took care of it so easily . i was getting a headache over it .
who am i ?
who else ?
mr. kim bong dal .
anthony .
thank you .
don 't mention it .
if anything ever troubles you , just let me know any time .
you have come .
shall we ?
the chairman expects a lot from you , mr. anthony .
the preparation for relocating your office will be finished within this month .
ah , miss sung min ah is already here .
oh , i finally get to see you .
i 'm anthony kim .
aigoo , i 've heard a lot about you .
nice to meet you .
please have a seat .
i think i 'll need to take business lessons from you , mr. anthony .
don 't say something like that even as a joke .
i don 't deserve such praise .
dramas are made by people , after all .
and you , mr. anthony , know the importance of people .
which makes me very glad to be working with you . well , then ,
i look forward to the business you 'll lead , mr. anthony .
best wishes .
i don 't know how to express my gratitude to you .
then , instead of saying it to me , show me .
just like you had made the actress sung min ah into a top star , make your world production into the best company in the world .
i look forward to it .
a new personal assistant ?
yes , my name is an sung mo . you may have heard from gwang soo already , i totally abhor posers , hypocrites , and such .
call me hyung from now on .
yes . yes , hyung .
at any rate , how did it go with writer lee ?
is she going to revise the script ?
hyung , don 't get me started on it .
last night , that bastard anthony came all the way here , and ...
he came here ?
what ?
my script analysis is elementary level and he called me the worst performing actor ever !
does that make sense ?
i 'm a bad actor ?
who does he have to thank for leading the viewership ratings ?
seriously !
sung mo ?
yes .
what do you think ?
about what ?
what else ?
my acting .
yes , you used to be one of the normal viewers , so you would be an accurate judge .
tell me .
is the acting performance of this kang hyun min pathetic ?
just be honest .
just be honest .
is it really true ?
yes .
what do you mean , yes ?
well , i mean , you have good looks , but but your acting isn 't ... that great .
hey , sung mo , you must be referring to hyun min 's debut performance !
uh ... i 've watched them all ... even the most recent ones .
well , you told me to be honest .
gwang soo ...
[ gwang soo ]
uh , hyung , what i said earlier didn 't upset you , did it ?
why would it upset me ?
who do you think i am ?
sung mo , i 'm not that petty . well , that 's a relief . you know ,
i 'm really bad at lying .
i can see that .
just focus on driving . so that we won 't be late .
yes , hyung .
[ kang hyun min 's impactful performance crosses the sea with his eyes ]
honestly , kang hyun min 's acting is overrated .
his good looks covers it all . however , those looks are fading , too .
i 'm only watching it for sung min ah . when i see khm , i can 't concentrate on the show .
he sucks .
hey , what day is better than christmas day to confess your felings to her ?
you have to make a dash for it !
he 's right .
well , that 's why i bought something for her ,
what ?
what is it ?
let 's see !
show us !
excuse me .
matching rings !
am i going too forward with this ?
does the woman express the feelings first ?
it is the man who has to open up first ! hear , hear !
besides , a matching set of rings sends a direct message of " let 's date . "
it 's straightforward !
- true , true .
i read a report that the gift that women want the most for christmas is jewelry !
i got this after reading that .
what 's so merry here ?
well , pd joo got a gift for the pretty fd .
i 'm sorry , representative .
not separating my personal life from work ...
well , that 's life after all .
so what is it that you 're hiding ?
huh ?
let me see what you got her .
tada !
they 're couple rings .
supposedly , this is what women want the most for christmas .
good luck .
where do you buy stuff like that ?
would you like me to take them out for you to see ?
the second one from the right .
this one ?
is it a gift ?
no .
my nephew has been begging me for it .
pardon ?
well , i guess my nephew got a girlfriend , but he 's so shy .
ah , i see .
what is the nephew 's size ?
well , maybe ... about this ? ah , i guess his size is the same as the uncle ?
we 're family , after all .
ah .
then , what about the size of the girl your nephew likes ?
well ,
i think about this big .
you 're going to gift it , you should call and ask first .
if the size doesn 't fit after opening the gift , she may think you 're not considerate .
bong dal kim .
mr. bong dal .
yes , representative .
do you have plans this evening ?
why ?
why else ?
we 've got to write our contract .
why are we writing the contract on christmas eve ?
in the evening even ?
because i say so .
at 8pm , come to the restaurant that ... no , i 'll decide on the location .
you ?
a nice place that i really like .
must be a shabby place that suits you perfectly .
you 'll have to see for yourself . i 'll text you . see you later then .
finish the script before you come out .
i 'm done already .
that 's good .
see you later .
yes ?
this is the moonhwa university hospital .
your test results from thursday are out .
yes .
yes , i see .
i 'm on my way .
now , don 't get too excited because it 's christmas eve .
let 's finish this quick so we can get home early .
yes , understood !
for the next scene , use the 300mm lense and zoom in on hyun min 's face .
i 'm sorry . i only prepared the 200mm lense .
then , use the 200mm lense , we 'll crop later , and magnify it to look like 300mm .
yes .
excuse me .
- yes ?
where is the fd ?
she 's probably in mr. kang hyun min 's room .
ah , i see .
well , then ... do you have time this evening ?
well , if the shooting gets done early enough , sure . then , we 'll resume shooting in 5 minutes , so tell mr. kang hyun min to get ready , please .
yes , i understand .
woo jin !
woo jin !
are you okay ?
how can this be ?
!
this is all my fault !
woo jin !
woo jin !
are you alright ?
don 't worry .
the people ...
i am sorry .
cut !
let 's go again .
ready ?
action !
don 't worry .
soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i really am sorry .
cut !
let 's take a break for 10 minutes .
what exactly is the problem ?
is it because i refused the commercial endorsement deal ?
that 's not it .
if not , then why are you making me cry for hours like this ?
!
i 'm really sorry .
i 'm just feeling under the weather today .
i 'm really sorry . i 'm really sorry .
how much have i cried ?
my eyes are gonna be all puffed up .
unni , can you get me an ice pack ?
yes .
do you have some time ?
i have something to say .
start talking . what is it ?
you 're not hung up about the commercial ...
is my acting really that bad ?
from your perspective , is my acting really poor ? from your perspective , is my acting really poor ?
what do you want me to say ?
please tell me honestly . as an actress . for you to ask me in person , doesn 't that mean you already think so ?
then , let me ask you one thing .
have you ever put any effort into acting ?
or do you know about your weaknesses ?
then , what about you ?
do you have a weakness you know about ?
who doesn 't have weaknesses ?
i 'm still practicing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to improve my pronunciation since my debut .
ga gya geo gyeo , like a child learning the alphabet , with a pen between my teeth .
if you really felt a problem with your acting , you yourself have to know what it is to fix it .
no matter what other people tell you , you have to know it for yourself .
spend some time to think about it .
it doesn 't seem like a side effect of the antidepressant .
there doesn 't seem to be a problem with your other tests .
then why does my vision get blurry sometimes ?
hmm ... how about getting yourself tested at the opthalmology ?
i 'll arrange it .
since you 're here already , why don 't you get tested .
tada ~ it looks nice .
what exactly is the problem ?
do you have a family member with poor eyesight ?
yes .
that is correct .
is that your mother ?
yes , but how ? yes , you have leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy that is maternally inherited .
it progresses really fast with few preliminary symptoms , so your right eye is already in bad shape .
looking at the pace of the condition , your right eye will lose its sight completely soon .
once that happens , unfortunately , even your left eye will ... eventually , you 'll lose sight in both your eyes .
wow , i hadn 't seen you in a while .
have you been well ?
yes , have you been well ?
yes .
would you like to order ?
well , i 'm waiting for someone today . when he gets here , i will .
did you get a boyfriend by any chance ?
no .
i 'm here .
where are you ?
i 'm here ...
where are you ?
in search of lost time
please leave a trace after reading the book .
( all entries are by lee go eun )
since your mother has this condition , you must know it very well .
there is no real way to cure it .
i regret to say this , but you should make preparations before both eyes lose sight .
ah , what are you doing ?
!
can 't you pour the water properly ?
my eyes sting !
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not eating !
why ?
does it taste bad ?
you eat it , mom .
you can 't even tell sugar and salt apart !
dummy .
idiot !
excuse me .
i guess the traffic is bad .
um ... i 'm sorry , but we 're closing .
ah , yes ...
where did you go to be back so late ?
you ignored my text and my calls .
what is this ?
i 'm sorry .
well , was something the matter ?
yes .
my mother was not well .
omo . is she doing okay ?
well , if that 's what happened , why didn 't you tell me ?
well , i guess you didn 't really have the mind to do that .
get in .
since you so desperately wish to renew my contract , i 'll do it .
let 's do that later .
it 's late . get back and rest .
lee go eun ...
when did it start ?
your feelings for me .
i deceived you .
i betrayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite all that , when did you start liking me ?
episode 17 do not be afraid of the darkness i deceived you . i betrayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite that , when did you start liking me ? did something happen ?
nothing happened . get inside and rest . representative !
why was he like that ?
what happened that he even had tears in his eyes ?
regrettably , it looks like the initial diagnosis still stands .
since your mother has this condition , you must know this already , but there is no way to cure it at this point .
* currently , no cure is available .
how to learn braille
you need to start getting ready for it .
normally , people with acquired blindness take about 3-5 years to adjust to be able to perform daily functions .
even just getting out of the house can feel like a formidable challenge .
from just grabbing a spoon to going to the bathroom , you have to learn how to do them by yourself .
do you have family that could take care of you ?
what is the percentage ?
the chance of me going blind .
i 'll ask one more question .
why is it me ?
my mom wasn 't enough ?
why are you even doing this to me ? i have finally found the reason why i must produce dramas , and i have also found the person who pointed it out to me .
and yet , after all that , why did you choose me ?
tell me . if you 're there , tell me !
why is it me ?
why ?
!
ready .
action !
my face ... take a good look .
this face ...
don 't ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
i 'm sorry , but can we do it again ?
but your eyes were really good just now .
why ? no , my gaze at jin hye rin needs to be full of sadness ,
i don 't think it was enough this time .
alright then .
alright , let 's do it one more time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
let 's do it one more time .
the director said it was okay .
why do you keep asking him to film it again ?
don 't pity me .
i 'm not saying this out of pity !
your eyes really did look sad ! i appreciate your comforting words , but you have to clearly point out my flaws for my acting to improve so that i can become a good actor .
director !
let 's do it one last time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget it .
cut !
how 's this one ?
you satisfied ?
yes .
i think it 's okay .
okay .
then , get ready for scene 38 !
sung mo !
script !
yes , hyung .
what 's wrong with him ?
did something happen ?
he wants to get better .
get better at what ?
acting skills .
hyun min said that ?
yes .
i 'm going to be worn out , it seems .
things to do from now on .
what are you doing ?
just some things .
can we speak ... for a bit ?
come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday .
in search of lost time
after so much time has passed , she finally reads the confession the man had left in the book .
and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go eun ♥ and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go eun ♥
when did you come ?
just now .
ah , i see .
i will answer the question you asked yesterday .
it 's true that i like you .
i don 't know since when , but it 's correct that i like you .
i will also ask one question .
yesterday ... why did you cry ?
there 's something wrong right ?
i 've been suffering from depression for three years .
that 's why i 'm crying , so it has nothing to do with you , so don 't mind it .
pretend that the issue of contract renewal never happened .
as if it never happened ?
what are you suddently talking about ?
there is one reason .
the relationship between a producer and writer should be upright with the right amount of fear and respect .
since the moment you started liking me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
then ...
what about sung min ah ?
you didn 't do that at that time .
but now it 's like that .
we can 't continue working together .
does that answer your question somewhat ?
i will take my leave .
i have an important appointment .
you 've come again .
hello !
who ... ?
the writer who came last time .
it 's good to meet you . i actually wanted to see you .
is your body fine ?
i heard you weren 't well yesterday .
did my son say that yesterday ?
ah ...
i guess i must 've heard wrong .
nowadays is out of control because of the script .
you have a hard time because of my son right ?
no , he is so nice to me .
that 's good , that you think about him like that . he grew up with a blind single parent , so his personality is _ _ _ _ _ , but his heart is kind .
i heard ... that you couldn 't see when he was five ...
at that time ... my heart hurt so much ... at first , my vision started to get blurry , but i thought it would get better over time .
instead , one eye went blind , and the other eye ended up blind as well .
i found out later that that 's how optic neuropathy progresses .
at any rate , you must be a special person to my son .
huh ?
why do you think so ?
because he told you about things like that .
ah . to be honest ...
i confessed my feelings to the representative .. .and i got rejected .
my son ... by nature , has no vision for women .
right ? !
i mean i 'm this pretty ...
i think he really doesn 't have an eye for girls .
what are you talking about ?
that doing business together is going to be hard ?
i 'm sorry .
can i ask the reason why you are refusing ?
it 's a personal issue , so i can 't tell you .
i hope that instead of me , you will find a good partner .
childish ! say if you don 't like a person , you 're always nagging me about the script .
if you know , hurry up and write the script , everyone is waiting .
i am a crazy girl for worrying about bong dal .
crossing out " cancel the investment deal with taesan "
morning of kyeongsong end of episode 19
i sent the 19th episode
got it .
ah ... it 's done , but ...
mr. kang hyun min sure will complain about the hair ...
the 19th episode came out .
really ?
it came out a lot faster than i thought .
what ?
i guess hyun min 's hairstyle changes , to a shorter haircut .
what ? what , what , what ?
so you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult .
could you please change that part this time ?
i 'm very sorry .
i was concerned about it , too , actually .
you don 't think you can persuade him ?
it is to signify the start of kim woo jin 's choice of an ordinary life .
to tell you the truth , hyun min is currently working on getting an endorsement deal for a shampoo .
an endorsement for shampoo ?
yes .
so , if he gets a haircut , he won 't be able to do it at all .
yes .
if it 's about an endorsement deal , kang hyun min sure wouldn 't want to cut his hair .
exactly !
i 'm sorry , miss writer .
i guess it can 't be helped .
i 'll change it .
really ? oh , thank you !
miss writer lee !
writer lee !
isn 't this hyun min 's voice ?
- writer lee !
i guess he 's already come to complain .
writer lee !
- don 't tell him that i was here !
writer lee !
open this door , now !
oh heavens !
what do you think ?
is this acceptable ?
you got a haircut !
of course .
a new woo jin style .
but , how did you ...
why ?
i got it cut after i saw the script .
do you want it shorter ?
just tell me !
well , mr. hyun min , weren 't you after a shampoo endorsement ... ?
who cares about endorsements ?
even if a tv or a car endorsement deal is on the table , if it is for the drama , i should cut it !
with overflowing spirit !
hyung !
what are you doing here ?
well , actually , to thank her for making your character so awesome .
that 's why i 'm here .
is that so ?
at any rate , writer lee , the last week of morning in kyeongseong will be full of this kang hyun min 's impactful acting spirit , just you wait .
fighting !
fighting !
director nam , what do you mean by that ? you can 't extend morning in kyeongseong ?
to extend a drama that was originally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we 're only doing it for the ratings .
rather than that , just finishing the drama with its current quality seems to be the better choice , in my judgment .
listen , director nam . " morning in kyeongseong " has just gone over 25 % , and is on the verge of getting into the 30 % range .
if we add 4 more episodes , we 'll get the rating over 30 % for sure , how can you suggest not doing it ? however , if you just prolong the story , it will inevitably lead to a drop in the quality .
in that case , it may ruin what we have accomplished so far with " morning in kyeongseong . "
director nam , are you crazy ?
do you know how much of the profits from commercials depends on 1 % of the ratings ?
this isn 't a place of art !
this is a business that needs to make a profit ! well , director ... - director nam ,
i understand your point of view , director nam . but this time , i would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself .
four more episodes ?
yes .
i 'm surprised by your lack of enthusiasm .
don 't producers usually welcome extension deals in a situation like this ?
yes , we 'll make the necessary preparations .
then ...
why ?
does he think 4 is too short ?
no , no .
he says he 'll prepare for it .
if we add 4 more episodes , that means 4 more weeks from now , starting with episode 19 .
i wonder what the odds are for my eyesight to last until then ?
could i really do it ?
no , i must do it .
please , hang on until then .
well now , i know how everybody must be tired , but since it 's been decided to extend the show , let 's do our best to the end ! yes !
fighting !
what do you think ? to spike up the last pitch , new woo jin style !
what 's with your faces ?
your hair ... why did you cut it so soon ?
excuse me ?
i cut it too soon ? well , we got an extension of 4 more episodes .
extension ?
yes .
well , to prolong the story , the ending will have to change .
hyun min , since it 's been extended , let 's go for 30 % of the viewership rating !
i 'm counting on you !
what were you doing , not being aware of the extension deal ?
my last big impact !
the new haircut of woo jin style !
how can you make it all into nothing like this ? ! hyun min , at any rate , now that it 's been decided , let 's go for 30 % of viewership rating , and get more money for the extended episodes .
isn 't that swell ?
hyung , is money all your concern ?
from now on , don 't ever insult my passion and spirit for acting with mere money .
well , then , are you not going to ask for a raise ?
how much more did sung min ah ask for ? are you crazy ? you know that you 're scheduled for a movie right away , and yet you agreed to the extension ?
min ah , this isn 't just any movie , but a movie directed by cho kyu sik .
besides , you 're the lead actress .
you know fully well how your schedule won 't allow for both the drama and the movie .
isn 't it your job to make that schedule work ?
so , just do as i said .
who exactly is the reason why you 're doing this ?
is it for anthony ? or ,
kang hyun min ?
is it because of him ?
listen carefully .
don 't ever stick me with that moron again !
got it ?
why do you keep barging in when i didn 't call you ?
extension ?
yes .
but i just have one more episode to work on .
how can i add 4 more episodes ? in order to write those 4 episodes without sacrificing the quality , we have to revise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday .
episode 19 ... uh ...
i know it won 't be easy .
however , from episode 19 to 24 , you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away .
the live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started .
you can do it , right ?
i will have to .
yes . as this is an emergency , put extra effort and write with speed .
where are you going ?
why ?
well , last time , you came fully loaded even with health supplements . i 'm not writer kim soo hyun or anything , i couldn 't possibly write on without discussing the plot , is what you had said .
we should discuss the plot .
this is an emergency .
i 'm not doing this because i have ulterior motives .
did i ask ?
the new episode 19
i 'm glad that we got done so fast .
you have to keep this pace from now on .
ah , before you leave , could you get me a glass of water ?
are you asking me to do that for you ?
what can you do ?
the writer with high viewership ratings is currently busy writing .
what are you doing ?
can 't you see it 's overflowing ?
you can 't even pour me some water ?
so don 't ask me to do it again !
did you do it on purpose ?
yes , that 's right .
just move !
it spilled to the floor !
let 's go . just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give up ? sung mo , get your emotions into it !
go again .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give it up ?
ah , this isn 't working , either .
i need something to help me get into it .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
are you sure you won 't give up on your dream ?
as long as you are by my side . woo jin ,
woo jin hugs hye rin .
no , no , no !
i can 't practice at all like this .
can 't you stop now ?
you 've been at it for 4 hours already .
we even skipped lunch !
wait a minute .
why didn 't i think of this before ?
instead , i can only give you 2 days a week for your drama .
that 's the least you can do , min ah .
of course .
i understand .
miss sung min ah ?
you can answer it .
oh , there 's no need .
it 's not an important call .
the phone is turned off , so the voicemail ...
ignoring my calls , huh ?
ok .
we have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the latest .
yes .
i 'm so sorry , director .
i 'll be right back .
why do you keep calling me ?
if only you had answered it the first time .
you 're the one who made me call you several times .
i 'm in a meeting with a film production .
that 's none of my concern .
just come to the shooting site right now .
shooting doesn 't start until 2 hours from now !
that 's why we should get together and practice !
if you don 't come now , i 'll call the film production myself , got it ?
bye !
he must have really lost his mind !
victory !
let 's go with this spirit !
sung mo !
i 'll be back , gwang soo .
hey , what about lunch ?
what should i do ?
i 'm so sorry , director .
looks like i have to go now for the shooting schedule today .
it 's ok .
you may go .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll talk to you later , director .
they must be really going great together .
yes ?
kang hyun min and min ah , i mean .
yes ? ah , no , that 's not really ... at any rate , there must be no wedding announcements before the movie release .
yes ? just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
let 's leave .
just like any other ...
you 're here !
isn 't it really cold outside ?
let 's leave .
we should practice it like we 're really doing it !
on your feet !
practice is only practice .
this kang hyun min 's acting is for real !
do you normally practice so casually , miss sung min ah ?
if you really want to do it for real , get rid of that script first .
ok .
now , ready , action !
let 's leave . just like any other ordinary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
can you really give up on your dream and live on ?
as long as you 're with me .
woo jin ...
mr. kang hyun min ...
i 'm so sorry !
we start shooting in 10 minutes .
what are you doing ?
go and clear up her misunderstanding !
is that petty little misunderstanding that important ?
my burning passion for acting won 't die because of it !
now , one more time .
why do you have to be so extreme in everything ?
i e-mailed you the script for episode 19 , mr. kim bong dal .
wow , he doesn 't even text me back any more .
start outlining episode 20 .
we can 't always work on it together .
since they 've worked for me , i know how skilled and faithful they are .
well , with your recommendation , i know they must be good , sunbae .
hm , looks like they have quite some experience ?
they 've gone through a lot in this field .
they 'll be a great asset to you .
you have to pay them at least that much .
at any rate , why are you handing over such great workers ? ah , well , it 's because ...
yes , director .
i just needed to stop at the office .
yes , i 'll be there in about 2 hours .
hello ?
is this world production 's joo dong suk pd ?
yes , but who is this ?
hello , i 'm calling on behalf of drama production company golden song .
we would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benefits .
could we have a meeting ?
ah , uh , me ?
yes , i heard that you are very talented .
we 'll give you 20 % more than your current salary . ah , yes , well , but , actually , i 'm currently working on a project .
also , to leave my current company all of a sudden seems ... of course , we understand .
you can take your time to consider our offer while finishing up with your current project .
we 'll contact you again .
what now ? you were so heartbroken by that girl , did something good happen ?
i just got a job offer from another drama production company . hey , you too ?
i got one , too !
me too !
what ?
we all got an offer from somewhere ?
even so , i want to keep working with representative kim to the end .
i suppose i will , too .
at any rate , the salary they offered was pretty tempting .
true , after all , our company is on the low side when it comes to salaries in this field .
speaking of which , i have a good idea .
the four of us can keep our loyalty , but let 's ask for a raise of 10 % .
or else , we 'll quit .
threaten him like that in fake ?
yes .
isn 't it great ?
i 'm in .
i 'm in , too .
are you in ?
in .
he 's in , too .
what are you doing so huddled up together ?
representative , i have something to tell you .
i 'll listen to it later .
i have something to say first .
once " morning in kyeongseong " is finished , i 'm going to close my company .
what ? i got a partnership offer from taesan group , but they didn 't want to keep your employment .
by taesan ... one of the top , leading companies in the country .
therefore , everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over .
team leader park , you should calculate the severance fee for everyone and put it on my desk .
hey , what was that ?
did we just get backstabbed ?
i heard that wrong , right ?
no wonder he had been surprisingly nice to us lately .
what was the number from that other production company ?
crossing out " transfer employees ( close the company ) "
sweet potato
what ?
what else ?
i just got done with episode 20 .
so , if you 're in the office , make a short trip to my studio .
what do you think ?
you did pretty well by yourself .
what ?
this doesn 't make sense .
where ? scene 38 , if hye rin is meeting with representative kang , is she betraying woo jin again ?
ah , that 's because there is a surprise element later on .
it 's all explained in scene 56 .
what is it ?
ah , no , nothing .
what do you think ?
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read it to the end !
i read it all .
you just flipped the page , and you read it all ?
yes , speedreading .
besides , i said it 's good .
why are you complaining ?
just keep writing the script . starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go page by page .
moonhwa university hospital , please .
your condition is progressing much faster than most other patients .
unfortunately , your right eye has already lost it 's sight .
it 's already started for your left eye , too .
how long will it take ?
for the left eye to lose sight completely ?
no .
how much time do i have left ? it is difficult to say for sure , but looking at it 's current pace , somewhere between 4 weeks and 2 months from now , your left eye will lose sight as well .
the more i think about it , the angrier i get .
he was so careless and rude .
was i clingy or what ?
is reading this that hard ?
why does it have 2 sheets of page 3 ?
then , he didn 't get to see scene 56 at all .
what do you think .
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read to the end !
i read it all .
why did he lie like that ?
at first , my vision was just blurry a little .
i thought it would get better over time .
but one eye lost its sight , and eventually , the other one did , too .
what are you doing ?
it 's overflowing !
what is it ?
no , nothing .
i found out later that that 's how optic neuropathy progresses .
this can 't be !
that 's not possible !
representative !
are you inside ?
how to learn braille
what to do from now on : 1 . mother 2 .
learnbraille 6 .
care facility for the blind
at least up until now , writer lee has been good about not making us do live shooting .
of course , that ends tomorrow .
yes .
it 's been 5 years since the last time i had to do that dogged live shooting .
director .
what is it ?
do you think you can finish morning of kyeongseong if i am not here ?
what do you mean ?
can you do it ?
why ?
does that taesan or whatever company want you to start working with them sooner ?
yes ?
i heard from joo pd .
i heard that you got a partnership offer there .
ah , yes .
go if you must , but only after finishing this .
even though i have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you , this drama doesn 't work even for a day without you , representative kim .
therefore , until this is done , don 't even think about running away .
now , let 's pick up the pace !
it 's going to get dark soon !
- yes !
yes !
is the preparation for the move going well ?
i 'm talking about the move to taesan group .
when will it be ?
ah , that matter ... i want to send flowers . when is it ?
well , the priority at the moment is " morning in kyeongseong . "
so just focus on the drama for now .
the date for the move hasn 't been decided yet ?
we 'll get to it eventually .
then ...
forgetleego eun
therelationshipbetweenthe writerandtheproducer requires a balanced tension of fear and respect .
now that you have started to like me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
crossingout " forgetlee goeun "
shall we go in ?
too much cold air isn 't good for you .
maybe in just a little bit .
hello !
you 're busy .
why did you come ?
i 'm not busy .
my employees are doing all the work .
still , as the representative , you should be present in the work place .
you shouldn 't just leave all the work to your employees .
mom .
what ? when i was young , what was it like when i made fun of you and was mean because you couldn 't see ?
wasn 't it upsetting ?
when was that ... such a long time ago .
i 'm sorry , mom .
what 's the matter ?
did something happen ?
tell me .
did something bad happen to you ?
it 's nothing .
once my current drama is done , i might be off to abroad because my business is going so well .
so stay still . since i might not be able to see your face for a while ,
i want to keep your face in my eyes .
oh , i see .
it 's a good thing that your business is going well .
instead of worrying , just go and return , because i will be fine .
your hands are cold .
let 's go inside , mom .
yes .
by the way , is that a new scarf ?
yes .
i got it as a gift .
a gift ?
from whom ?
she begged me not to tell you ... actually , to tell you the truth , i ... confessed my feelings to the representative and got rejected .
mychild just doesn 't have a good eye for women .
that 's right .
i 'm pretty like this .
i agree that he doesn 't have an eye for women .
i brought a present for you .
there 's a present ?
yes .
i knit it myself , it keeps you really warm in the winter .
if you look here , it says b d k .
b-d-k ?
yes .
bong dal kim .
you shouldn 't do that to such a nice young lady . if it 's because you have to go abroad , tell her .
because it seems to me , she really is a nice girl .
where have you been ?
did you finish the script ?
it 's cold . instead of catching cold again , go in .
how long were you going to conceal it ?
until when were you going to conceal the fact that you are going blind ?
you said it was depression .
you said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business .
correct .
it 's none of your business so beat it .
how can it not concern me ?
so what ?
what can you do for me ?
yes .
what you are saying about my not being able to see is correct .
i won 't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom .
i won 't be able to see the dramas which i made .
or the scripts either .
i won 't be able to see your face and where you are standing , and whether you are smiling or crying
i won 't be able to see .
is that why you are giving up ?
what if i say it doesn 't matter to me ?
for me , it doesn 't matter .
we have to endure lack of sleep , script by pages , and miserable life to make sure there 's no shame in our every minute , every second and keep us reminded of who we are at this moment .
the last tape of " morning in kyeongseong " hasn 't made it to the editing room yet .
even if it 's just 1 % of hope , that 's better than nothing .
a miracle is not something you wait for , but something you create .
the representative , the representative , on his way , had an accident ...
you must come back with that miracle !
the finale the last of the king , or the last king . where have you been ?
did you finish the script ? don 't catch a cold in this cold weather . hurry and go in .
until when are you going to hide that ? until when are you going to hide the fact you 're going blind now ? you said , what , depression ?
didn 't you say it 's none of my business so don 't bother ?
yes .
it 's none of your business , so back off .
why is it none of my business ?
so what ?
what can you do for me , then ? that 's right . as you said , it 's true that i won 't be able to see any longer .
i won 't be able to eat or go to the washroom by myself . i won 't be able to see the dramas i made , or your scripts ,
or your face either .
even where you 're standing , even whether you 're smiling at me or crying ,
i won 't be able to see all of them .
is that why you 're giving up ?
what if i say it still doesn 't matter ?
i 'm saying it doesn 't matter to me .
it will be difficult ( for you ) to endure .
even so , i want to go that way .
let 's go together .
maybe , this will be my last time to see the sunrise .
even if you can 't see , i will make you be able to feel it .
and beside you , i will be there .
even if you can 't see the dramas you made , even if you can 't see my face or my drama , where you 're standing , whether you 're smiling at me or crying , i will see all of them .
since we came all the way here , will we have some time to sleep ?
what ... what did you say ?
why are you so startled ?
wa ... wait !
i ... am ... not that easy of a woman .
what are you thinking now ?
i 'm saying let 's take a short nap in the car .
considering that our way back home would be a great hardship , don 't you think we should take a nap ?
so vulgar !
that 's right !
i 'm so vulgar !
with this driving skill , how on earth did you get your driving license ?
i told you , this is the first time i 'm driving since i got the license !
to be precise , this is your second time .
what ?
once to come here , and second time to go back .
if it 's your second time , there should be some improvement .
you chickened out !
just look where you 're driving !
okay . from now on , for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes , we should run around busily making sure they will be aired with no accident .
even if we have to endure a life like a third-rater with light sleeping and page-by-page scripts , those minutes and seconds of our rrespective moments will make us later remember ourselves in this right moment . the scripts will be handled by writer lee and me , so pd joo , manager han , manager park and koo hee jae , you guys take care of the filming sites . yes .
yes .
well , then do your best in your post .
got it ?
yes !
the real problem here is sung min ah , who is currently filming both our drama and a movie . since sung min ah 's schedule isn 't favorable , you should write the script minimizing jin hye rin 's portion as much as possible .
you can do it , right ?
i will even kill jin hye rin if i have to at the last episode to make sure , so don 't worry .
the script for episode 20 arrived !
did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well ?
yes .
good . from now on , for all the scripts we will receive , we should film the scenes of min ah putting together as much as we can , so organize the schedule accordingly .
yes .
well , well , hurry up .
let 's run again !
yes .
kim woo jin , kim woo jin , kim woo jin , kim woo jin ! sung mo , - how many scenes in total ?
it 's 52 vs 36 .
overwhelmingly , you have many more scenes !
finally , my effort is shining .
the real value of my acting on the screen finally touched writer lee . therefore , sung mo , you should try , too .
find your flaw .
the one who doesn know about one 's self would never be able to improve .
sung mo , what is your flaw ?
well , i don 't know , my flaw is ...
hemorrhoids ?
hemorrhoids ?
that ...
you just need to go to the hospital to treat it . well , by the way , hyung , all those lines , will you be able to memorize them all ?
if there are only a few lines , that 's the problem , not the other way around .
taking this opportunity , i should clearly show kang hyun min 's burning acting skills !
let 's go .
at the begining of episode 21 , jin hye rin is captured by president kang .
to save hye rin , kim woo jin will fight alone against all the enemies .
so that we can film jin hye rin 's scenes at once , all together in a long take ?
exactly !
it can enhance it 's dramatic tension and also help us manage the filming schedule .
kang hyun min would have a hard time , though .
good , let 's proceed in that way .
but how are your eyes ? are they alright ?
the other side 's eye is still fine .
what are you doing now , not writing ?
okay .
ah , i think i 'm really a genius , don 't you think so ?
but really ... when was it that you started to like ?
huh ?
when did you start to like me ?
what about you ?
i asked you first .
so , for me ... when there was the argument about plagiarism , you ... you said ... you would believe me no matter what ...
what about you ?
i don 't remember .
it 's not fair !
i told you everything !
just write your script .
hurry up and tell me ! when was it ?
if you don 't tell me , i won 't write any more .
if you finish your script , then i will tell you .
that 's really low .
did you find that out just now ?
ready , action !
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment .
on that day when we first met at woo mi theater ...
the day we first met ...
cut !
i will do it again .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , when we aimed a gun at each other ...
on that day ...
cut !
ah !
what was the next line ?
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , even the day when we aimed a gun at each other ...
cut !
hyun min !
let 's read the script once and try again .
no , director !
i can do it !
let 's try again .
no , no .
let 's take a 5-minute break .
ah !
i really memorized all !
just use a prompter . what ?
whom do you think is responsible for this ?
are you saying i should cheat for acting , while reading lines from a prompter ?
i was just trying to help .
no need .
you seem to think i can 't do this , but wait and see .
i will act perfectly after memorizing all the lines .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at woo mi theater , even on that day we aimed a gun at each other .
i have never forgotten about all of them , not even for a moment .
so , please , believe me .
i believe you .
this is the only choice to let us be together .
cut !
ok !
hyun min ! everything was great , including your last stare !
ha ! of course , who am i ! ?
considering the speed of progress of your disease , it will be a burden if you keep working .
but there is something i must do .
if the blindness is unavoidable , i 'm thinking to work as much as i can . actually , there is something i didn 't tell you because i didn 't want to give you too much hope .
recently , in bascom palmer eye institute in florida , u.s. , there was the first clinical trial of dna treatment for this disease .
its result showed some patients to be cured , even if its success rate is really low . we don 't know when they will announce the start of the second trial , and although when it is announced , it won 't be easy for you to be on the list , but i will try my best as well .
thank you .
go eun !
mom is here .
oh , you 're here !
i 'm sorry , but i have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible .
geez , i won 't interrupt , so just keep writing !
hey , do you have an assistant writer ?
no , why ?
then , why do you have two toothbrushes ?
oh , that is ...
i haven 't seen these before , either .
wait , aren 't these for men ?
no , no ... that 's not ... you !
by any chance , that bong dal or something , did you let him in here all the time ?
no , mom , that 's not the case !
oh , you 're here !
oh , you came at the right time .
representative , you said you know the guy named kim bong dal .
please give me his contact detail .
ah mom , that 's not the case .
what do you mean that 's not the case ? here are two toothbrushes , and even a man 's lotion . these are clearly its evidence !
this bastard !
i have to see his face ! ah ...
mother ... there must be some misunderstanding .
the guy named kim bong dal isn 't that bad .
that 's why i 'm saying i will meet him .
mom , later , later , i will introduce him to you later .
later my ass !
i can just call him myself now .
mom ... mom !
here it is !
bong dal !
mom !
it 's my alarm .
give it back to me !
ah , mom , so ... just leave !
can 't you see me not being able to work now ?
anyway , you !
this is a warning !
warning !
hello !
what is this ?
what do you mean ?
it 's a cup of coffee .
have some .
by the way , why did you write it yesterday ?
over there , on the pillar .
well , that 's because you seemed to have a really hard time , so i just wrote it on there .
is that all ?
then , of course , that 's all .
what else can it be ?
many women don 't know their own feelings .
fine . if your feeling for me is that deep , i won 't resist it any longer , not like i did before .
what did you say ?
you fell for me , right ?
please , don 't have such illusions !
you want to keep your pride ?
i also know well about women 's pride .
seriously ... what the ... cute . lovely .
there 's a limit to how simpleminded you can get ...
what if he starts clinging to me like a leech ?
i 'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is .
ridiculous ...
min ah .
oh , director !
i was meaning to call you as well .
i know you 're busy .
my schedules are stacked because of the movie and the drama .
well i 'm calling for your next project which we discussed before .
what do you think to work for writer kim eun sook 's drama ? ( of " secret garden " " a gentleman 's dignity " )
that 'd be excellent if we work with writer kim eun sook !
but , did the rep. agree to that ?
to work with writer kim eun sook ?
oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ? what news ? oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ?
what news ?
anthony has declined tae san group 's offer due to personal reasons .
what the hell happened ?
they 're saying you declined tae san group 's investment offer due to personal reasons .
that 's correct .
so what exactly is that personal reason ?
the reason ...
i 'll tell you on the day " morning in kyeongseong 's " last episode airs .
so please finish well .
cut !
ok !
that was great !
prepare the next scene !
23.9 !
good work everyone .
i want to review the documents so send them over .
yeah .

done !
send it by e-mail , quickly .
i 've sent the e-mail too . now , it 's really done !
you 've done a great job .
you would want to have a good sleep , but you need to go somewhere with me .
at this late hour ?
change your clothes and come out .
where ?
you 're here .
yes .
why are you staying there ?
come in .
who is ... ?
hello .
the writer who gave you a scarf present .
i know who it is by her voice .
welcome .
mom , i kept my promise .
okay .
what ... promise ?
there is something like that .
what is ... that promise ?
yes .
i 've just received a message from the u.s .
please come to the hospital as soon as possible .
the second clinical trial 's patient list is announced .
you 're on that list . as i 've told you before , the possibility to avoid your blindness is as low as a miracle , but let 's hope for that miracle .
ah , and the reason i asked you to come here urgently was because you need to leave tomorrow , right away .
tomorrow ?
yes .
among the subject patients , there was one patient , who missed the timing to treat and went blind in both eyes , so that 's why you could be on that list instead of that patient .
to meet the due date per florida time , you must leave for florida tomorrow .
what is that expression about ?
