yeah ...
oh , good !
it 's all fixed , then ?
actually , it 's been slow here at saito paper company , so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard .
but it was worth it to see you smiling again !
saito-san ...
oh , you 're welcome !
mom used to say , " from that day on , yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar , and played it every single day . "
you were great at the concert !

woman : oh , thank you . thank you for curing me , dr .
freud .
thanks to your miracle technique ,
i am no longer delusional . it 's called hypnosis , fraulein .
i took you back to re-experience your childhood .
whatever you did , it worked . i used to think that little men were following me around ,
but now i know that little men were just in meine imagination .
[ doorbell rings ] ach . excuse me , fraulein .
you stand lookout while i write my name
in dr .
now , fraulein , where were we ? aaah !
the little men ! the little men ! they 're back !
bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl ... aaah !
hmm . you know , you might want to think about another appointment .
aah ! what are we going to do now , brain ?
ring some more doorbells and run away ? no , pinky . ohh !
to see the great hypnotizing psychiatrist
dr. sigmund freud .
oh , bravo , brain .
you 're finally getting some help
for that problem of yours--
look , pinky , i 'll explain this one more time . my appointment with dr .
freud is only a ruse . when he tries to hypnotize me ,
i will use a pair of mirrored glasses to reverse the process ,
thereby hypnotizing freud himself . egad ! brilliant , brain !
then you can make him wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey .
pinky , how would that possibly help us
to take over the world ?
well , actually , i was thinking of it
more as entertainment . poit .
all vienna knows that the emperor franz josef
is being treated by freud for depression .
when freud is under my spell ... unh ! i will order him to hypnotize the emperor into giving me , the brain ,
his right to the imperial throne ,
allowing me to take over the world !
[ squeak ] [ plop ] uhh ! ooh !
they 're right in here with all the fun , fun games
i brought to play with in the waiting room . zort !
[ gasps ] oh , look .
i 've got jacks and wind-up toys
no ! don 't leave me !
well , what about all this stuff ? boring . been there , done that .
well , make small talk with that man over there
and give me my mirrored glasses .
um ... hi . let 's see . um ... do you know anything about lilliputians ?
excuse me ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to make small talk . ach , don 't trouble yourself .
i 'm just a sad little sad man . life brings me nothing but dreary sadness .
i 'm sad all the time . boy , am i sad .
well , i brought a pair of googly-eye glasses . they 'll cheer you up .
oogedy-boogedy ! ha ha ha ha ha ! narf !
but all i see is my own dreary , sad little sad face .
poit .
these aren 't my googly-eye glasses .
these are mirrored gla-- [ gasps ]
uh-oh . you are getting sleepy ... very sleepy .
no , no . you are getting sleepy .
[ boing ] hey , take off those ridiculous glasses .
huh ? now , where were we ? ah , yes .
you are getting sleepy . wait .
pinky has my other glasses . i--i need them .
you don 't need glasses to be hypnotized . oh , yes . really , i ...
have ... to ... get ... them . i ...
yes .
let yourself go .
must remember to ... hurt pinky at first opportunity .
no .
you don 't want to hurt anybody . we are going to discover who hurt you . we are going back to your childhood .
going back ... back .
you are in a deep sleep , ja ?
ja .
i mean ... yes . i want you to think about a time when you were very young .
freud : where you are , brain ? brain :
in a field , playing . how old are you ? just a child ,
not a care in the world .
[ grunts ]
[ snap ] [ clatter ]
[ grunts ]
suddenly i 'm being chased ,
hunted down like some sort of rabid dog .
terrified , i run home to my parents .
they rush to my aid , but my assailant is overpowering . i was taken from my home
and sent to a research facility .
as i entered those doors , the carefree innocence of my youth
was snuffed out like a candle ,
replaced with unremitting darkness . lab-coated goons tried to break our spirits and brainwash us into submission .
others emerged from the experience ... not quite all there .
narf ! zort ! hee hee hee hee !
the slightest insolence resulted in punishment both swift and brutal .
[ mice gasp ] more ? you want more ?
aah .
aah !
i never met a man i didn 't meet .
aah !
the problem with congress is ... they 're all liars .
aah ! make it stop !
and how did that make you feel ?
angry ... like i wanted to ... to take over the world .
hmm . emotional displacement . obviously , you were missing the comfort of your home .
it 's ... a tin can .
there 's something on the side of it , a ... a picture .
no . no . i--i mean , i--i can 't tell .
it 's a picture of ... of ... the world ! and then they dragged me away . and you want your world back .
it 's simple . yes . [ snap ] what ?
where am i ? your problem is simple , herr brain . you just want to go home .
i don 't ? i don 't ? [ click ] ok , time 's up .
" how to hypnotize anyone .
create a relaxing atmosphere . "
okey-dokey , you sick little puppy . move it . i got another client .
oh , there 's not enough time for this .
[ smack ] oh !
oh , no . what have i done ?
oh , no . what have i done ? yes !
you 'll obey my every command . i will obey .
is nothing but cheap nostalgia .
maybe all i 'm really longing for is ... is ... a rusty tin can .
what a quack . ha ha ha ha ha ! narf !
oh , very good , mr . elephant . zort !
ach , herr pinky , i 'm having the most exciting fun
for the first time in my dreary , sad life . ha ha ha ha ! ha ha ha ha !
narf ! ha ha ha ha ! ha ha ha ha !
i will hypnotize the emperor franz josef and order him to make brain his successor .
perfect . when i snap my fingers , you will awaken .
[ snap ]
ach !
herr brain , it 's late .
you made good progress today .
more than you know , doctor .
oh , come over any time , herr pinky .
here is meine card .
auf wiedersehen . gesundheit ! who 's your new friend , pinky ?
" his most imperial emperor franz josef " ?
pinky , that 's the man i wanted freud to hypnotize .
oh , he doesn 't want to be hypnotized now , brain .
since i taught him all my favorite games , he says he 'll never need therapy again .
i believe i need therapy , pinky , to find out why i hang around with a nut like you .
come . we must go back to the lab
and prepare for tomorrow night . why , brain ? what are we going to do tomorrow night ?
try to shrink your head ? no , pinky ,
the same thing we do every night , no matter how forcefully the purveyors of psychobabble
attempt to dissuade us-- try to take over the world !
♪ they 're dinky ♪ ♪ they 're pinky and the brain ♪
♪ brain , brain , brain , brain ♪
assuming a standard height-to-weight ratio
and a 3-point margin of error ... pinky : ha ha ha ha !
[ synthetic laughter ] factor in g-force and wind shear
of each downward thrust ... ha ha ha ha !
[ synthetic laughter ] that does it !
pinky , what are you doing ? ha ha ha ! oh , poit !
i 'm playing with my new " tickle me herbert " doll , brain . you just tickle him here ,
and he laughs and laughs . kootchie kootchie kootchie ! [ synthetic laughter ]
well , put it away .
i can hardly hear myself think .
maybe you 're just not thinking loud enough , brain . pinky , may i see that for a moment ?
sure--uhh !
[ synthetic laughter ] [ laughter fades ]
oh , brain , i think he likes you .
zort !
now maybe i 'll have the quiet i need
to finish perfecting my latest plan .
you might say we 're going fishing .
and all the stuff you need for keeping bees .
that 's not fishing . ha !
oh , that 's skiing . try to focus , pinky .
this is the finnious japonicus ,
commonly known in japan as mugu .
one bite of its tail renders anyone who eats it
unable to move for 24 hours .
i had a linoleum sandwich last week that made me feel the same way , but shiny .
and place it over your mouth . [ muffled ] ok .
my plan is simply this--
i will capture a pair of mugu , breed them , and market the tails throughout the world as cappy brain 's frozen fish sticks .
while the populace is immobilized ,
i shall implement my plan of world domination . there 's only one catch .
oh ?
well , that won 't be enough to feed the whole world , then , will it ?
[ muffled ] sorry . the japonicus is so rare
that the only known specimens
are those bred in captivity for the dining pleasure of japan 's most elite sumo wrestlers .
[ muffled question ]
if you 're going to speak , pinky . oh .
[ muffled question ] i have anticipated your query , pinky .
i plan to become one of japan 's most elite sumo wrestlers . observe .
narf !
[ gasps ] the " tickle me dom deluise " ?
oh , why , that 's the most expensive one .
look closer , pinky .
to fit the precise specifications
of a champion sumo wrestler .
with the adjustments i 've made ,
i 'll be able to flip a 600-pound man .
won 't you need an awfully large spatula for that ?
don 't forget to pack your doll
when we go to japan , pinky .
i might feel the need
noogie . give him the noogie .
noogie , noogie , noogie . unh !
good work , tomu-san . tomorrow we work on the wedgie . now go .
brain : master hama ? yes ?
allow me to introduce myself . i am the brain .
i have come many miles with my small valet pinky
to study sumo at the camp of master hama .
your head is as small as a lychee nut ,
but your physique is excellent for sumo .
i would be honored to teach you .
actually , i am but an insignificant lab mouse
attempting to take over the world . the honor is all mine . [ clank ]
whaa ! whoa ! [ crash ]
there is no need for false humility and groveling . come .
we begin immediately . let us begin our first lesson .
excellent .
who do i flip first ? patience , brain-san .
when you are more advanced .
today , we consider the pebble .
consider the pebble ?
zen exercise to increase concentration .
observe the pebble 's simplicity . listen to its silence .
become the pebble . you want me to stare at a rock all day ?
just until lunchtime .
see you in 4 hours .
hama thinks i 'm a beginner , pinky . until he lets me compete
with advanced wrestlers , i 'll never get access to the mugu .
pinky ?
i was becoming one with the pebble .
were you ? yes .
and it 's really easy .
all you have to do is make your mind a complete blank .
too bad drawing a blank isn 't an olympic event , pinky .
we could retire on the gold medals you 'd win .
eat well , brain-san . we have much training left to do .
aren 't you hungry , master hama ? no .
i eat big lunch with my star wrestlers in other dining hall--
fried mugu , cajun mugu , mugu chowder , mojo mugu .
perhaps you will be allowed to eat mugu , too , eh ?
sooner than you think , my pan-pacific friend .
the sumo men must eat a lot to get so fat .
wrestlers not fat , pinky-san . it is muscle tissue
resulting from years of strenuous yoga exercises . [ door opens ] who wants pie ?
pinky , a day has passed , and we have nothing to show for it .
oh , i don 't know , brain . i 've developed a lovely relationship with our new friend the pebble .
pinky , have you ever contemplated the sound of one hand bopping ?
one hand , um ... don 't think so .
aah ! [ crowd chattering in distance ]
what 's going on ?
it is matsuhisa , the best wrestler in camp . he has had too much pie
and is taking on all challengers . grrr ! pinky : egad , brain .
to beat that matsu hoozy fellow .
pinky , are you pondering what i 'm pondering ?
i think so , brain ,
but who wants to see snow white and the seven samurai ?
no , pinky .
i will defeat the great matsuhisa , thereby proving that i am a great sumo wrestler .
matsuhisa , i will accept your challenge . what 's going on here ?
brain-san has gone completely insane . hmm , oh , that would explain
[ grunting ]
oof ! quit now , brain-san .
better to be live coward than dead idiot .
don 't worry , hama . it 's a matter of scientific fact
that i can flip any man up to 600 pounds . matsuhisa weighs 601 pounds .
noogie , noogie , noogie . ow !
stop hurting brain , you , you pie wrecker !
[ grunts ] whoa !
[ crash ]
[ boing ]
whaa !
[ grunts ]
kootchie kootchie .
[ laughing ] kootchie kootchie kootchie .
poit . kootchie kootchie koo . zort !
kootchie koo . kootchie poit !
[ crowd gasps ]
whaa ha ha ha ! whoa ho ho ho !
whoa ! whoa ! oof !
[ cheering ] the winner ! narf !
pinky : ooh , now we can get into the fancy restaurant , brain .
and we 'll get ahold of the fancy fish . this way , pinky .
this is it , pinky . the world 's only specimens of finnious japonicus
are in this tank . soon , kitchen freezers throughout the world will be stocked with cappy brain 's delicious mugu tails ,
you put the yum in yum-yum-yummy , cappy brain . zort !
[ both grunt ] tell me if you see any movement , pinky .
pinky : um , think i saw some movement just then , brain .
perhaps i should have researched the size of the mugu
a bit more thoroughly .
what do we do now , cappy brain ? hope the chef pushes the mugu , pinky ,
and plan for tomorrow night . why ?
what are we going to do tomorrow night , brain ? same thing we do every night , pinky--
dry off , and then
try to take over the world .

brain , voice-over : you may be wondering what a smart mouse like me is doing
floating face down in a large body of water .
well , you could say it 's all a result of the misguided attentions i paid to a certain member of the fairer sex .
pinky : poit ! you mean , you 're in the soup
yes , pinky , to use the vernacular .
i suppose i should start at the beginning .
the night began like any other .
i 'd hatched a scheme that was sure to take us straight to the top .
pinky , the key to global conquest sits right on the top of your head .
petroleum jelly ?
a little dab 'll do ya !
no , pinky .
neek . your hat .
behold the instrument of our conquest .
egad !
an amusement park for fleas .
no .
it 's the miniature prototype for my greatest stroke of genius , pinky .
the fedor-a-matic .
observe .
we shall divert the flow of the los angeles municipal water supply to a gigantic version of this mock-up .
ooh , a water park !
will it have slippery slides and bumper boats ?
will it , brain ? huh ?
look closer and see , pinky .
yes , the fedor-a-matic works like a dream !
i 'll say .
i feel all tingly in a good way .
oh ! you would .
but the more likely reaction will be panic and utter chaos .
with the populace trapped in their hats , we shall seize los angeles and then ...
pomona !
pomo--egad !
brilliant , brain .
oh , but no , no , wait .
what about people who don 't wear hats ?
there are no people who don 't wear hats .
it 's 1946 .
everyone wears hats all the time .
now , come , pinky .
we must travel to city hall and obtain the water rights for the fedor-a-matic from the council .
how , brain ?
are we going to bribe them with captain midnight secret decoder rings ?
no , pinky .
don 't be too sure i 'm as crooked as i 'm supposed to be .
besides , there 's no reason the city council shouldn 't look with favor upon the ambitions of a young lab mouse
brain , voice-over : it couldn 't fail .
but then she walked back into my life .
billie--a comely female specimen of consummate genetic design .
pinky : is that like a real swell dish with more curves than mulholland drive , brain ?
brain : yes , pinky .
[ refined , alluring voice ] hello , egghead .
billie , there 's something ...
different about you .
well , i 've been taking ... [ inhales ] breath control lessons .
[ gulp ] yes , so i see .
oh , pardon me . zort !
ha ha ! oh , this theater 's so dark , i can 't seem to find my seat .

that 's funny , pink-- [ catching herself ] ooh .
i mean ... how whimsical . [ humming ]
if you 've just come to laugh ...
[ squawky ] i need help , eggie ,
so i came to you . natch .
[ refined ] i mean , naturally , i decided to seek your assistance .
how very flattering .
now , if you 'll excuse us , billie . we have important labors to attend to .
[ squawky ] you mean , taking over the world is more important than ... me ?
now , don 't get all malleable on me .
you always knew work came first .

and now i need your help .
yes , well , if you 're in trouble , get yourself a gumshoe .
or at least a really sticky hat .
brain : i hated being tough on the old girl , but i was a mouse on a mission ,
brain : correction .
no one else was going to get in my way . billie :
aah ! help !
help , egghead !
help ! help !
pinky , it 's billie .
she really is in a pickle .
oh . dill or sweet ?
it 's all my fault .
why didn 't i help her ?
well , it might have something to do with the time she r-r-r-ripped out your fragile heart , then smashed it into millions of tiny little pieces .
yes . thank you , pinky .
yes , and then squ-u-u-i-i-ished them all up and ground them into pate .
i get the picture !
oh , and then she left you
for that gerbil-y fellow called--
snowball : snowball .
i told you never to say that name !
i didn 't say it , brain .
then who ... did ?
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! oh , i 'm sorry , brain . but i do so love it
when you wail pathetically . and now that billie is mine again , i suppose you 'll be doing nothing but wailing .
oh , i don 't think so .
brain gets terribly seasick .
you dirty ... hamster !
let billie go or i 'll--
heads .
tough luck , brain .
maybe you can try for 2 out of 3 .
brain , brain , brain .
you should know by now that no matter how many times we play the game , i always win .
well , i 'll give my regards to billie for you .
toodle-oo , old chump .
g 'bye , snowball .
be sure to call again soon !
don 't be shy ! drop by any ti--aah !
to coin a phrase ... ouch .
brain : billie needed me ,
so , putting my plans for world domination on hiatus , we hastened to the palatial abode of my nemesis .
pinky : you mean we hot-footed it to the hamster 's joint ?
brain : clam up , pinky .
the hamster lived in one of those $ 30,000 spanish-style medieval castles that everyone was so nuts about a few years back .
now , keep your eyes peeled for clues .
do they make a special utensil for that , brain ?
no , pinky , but i believe they do make a mouth clamp .
why don 't you use it ?
it 's billie , pinky !
we must make haste !
you mean , " get the lard out , chump " ? whaa !
brain : it can 't be !
pinky , the hamster has purloined our designs for the fedor-a-matic .
you know what that means ? oooh !
i 'll get another tight , tingly hat ?
no , pinky .
a slightly snug sombrero ?
no !
mildly uncomfortable lederhosen ?
not only has the hamster stolen billie , he wants to steal the world !
no !
[ grunting ] pinky ... help !
my hat is stuck .
always the lucky one , aren 't you ?
what happened to my hat ?
ahh ! look , brain !
a whole gaggle of hats .
pinky , where are you ?
this one 's rather rakish . hoo hoo .
brain ? where are you ?
how do i make it tight ?
oh , the irony of it all .
hoisted by my own fedor-a-matic .
brain ! the world !
the world can wai--oof !
there you are , brain .
bad for glass ! bad for glass !
bad for brain .
all my suffering was for naught , pinky .
we don 't have a single clue to follow .
does that mean this grocery list i found in my hat isn 't a clue ?
" things to do . "
[ reading ]
" bribe city council " ?
-type theme ] pinky : this is the city-- um ...
i mean , this is the city hall !
but you can 't sell off the water rights .
i need water for my arugula !
and i need water for my kombucha mushroom plantation .
i need water for my mr. wiggly-woggly hosey thingy dingy dere !
sorry , but the water rights have already been awarded .
meeting is adjourned .
jiminy ! i always wanted a captain midnight decoder ring !
i 'll say ! this is swell !
pinky , are you pondering what i 'm pondering ?
i think so , brain , but if we get sam spayed ,
we 'll never have any puppies .
no , pinky .
someone has already bribed the council for the water rights .
you mean ...
don 't say it , pinky .
wee willie winkie ?
no , pinky .
snowball :
too late again , brain .
pppbbbbllttt !
after him , pinky !
i need water for my elephants ! ow !
we 're in luck !
taxi !
tax--eeegh !
follow that car !
yes ! this is a pain that is most promising .
egad ! it 's astounding , brain .
that i am pliant enough to survive such calamity ?
nooo ! that you actually found a cab in l.a. natch !
brain :
we got to the reservoir without a moment to lose . pinky :
and there were 3 bowls of porridge .
and i said , " my , grandma .
what big , swollen ankles you have . "
brain : stow it , pinky .
come on , pinky .
it 's not as hard as it looks . argh !
you just get a little-- [ ripping ] yaah ! scraped up , that 's-- [ ripping ]
pinky !
pinky , hurry up !
right here , brain . natch !
oh , well , sure !
you can take the easy way !
man with polish accent : hold it right there , mousey mouse .
you 're a very nosy fella , mousey mouse .
you know what happens to nosy fellas , hmm ?
huh ? do you ? hmm ?
this !
gee , i never think to carry an umbrella in los angeles . gaaah !
egad !
i 'll save you , brain !
um , brain , before i save you , do you think you could teach me to swim ?
with all that air in your head , it 's a wonder you don 't float .
whoo-hoo ! that was almost as thrilling as our swirling whirlpool of fun
you 've been playing in the toilet again , haven 't you , pinky ?
well , if you want to get technical ...
no ! it can 't be !
pinky , we 're too late .
the fedor-a-matic has been built !
ooh , joy !
tight hat city , here we come !
top of the world , brain .
care to tip your hat to my accomplishment while you still can ? ha ha ha ha ha !
after him , pinky .
he 's about to engage the machine .
poit ! i didn 't even know they were going steady .
we really ought to bring a gift , brain--hwack !
you know where they 're registered ?
congratulations , snowball !
we 're so happy for you and your fiancee !
a hamster engaged to a big machine ?
what will people say ?
brain : stop being foolish , pinky .
oh , you 're right , brain .
as long as they 're happy .
we should get them something nice .
a fondue set , maybe . i mean , after all , we are getting tight hats in the bargain .
i 'll stop you now .
no !
it can 't be !
egad , brain !
snowball 's turned into a mouse !
no , pinky . it 's billie .
billie 's turned into a hamster ?
nyeh ! she 's a mouse !
she 's a hamster !
she 's a mouse !
she 's a hamster !
she 's a mouse and a hamster ? [ sobbing ]
yes , eggie , it is i .
but ... but why ?
snowball : because she loves me .
yes , brain , it was all a ruse ,
designed to distract you long enough for us to steal your plans and execute them .
and execute me in the process .
don 't be silly , brain .
it would take all the fun out of life .
i derive my greatest pleasure from making you squirm .
i derive my greatest pleasure from making brain squirt milk out of his nose . natch !
ha ha ha ha ! billie : stop that !
snowball wasn 't trying to get rid of you , egghead . i was !
what ?
i 'm sorry , eggie , but as long as you 're in the picture , i 'll never really have the thing i want most .
the world ?
no .
me .
guess again .
what ?
put me down , you goon .
sorry , snowy .
i was just using you to get the water rights .
besides , you never could accept me for what i am , making me take voice lessons and all .
and you , eggie , you love the world too much to ever really care about me .
sorry , but neither of you will ever hold a candle to my one true love .
pinky ...
pinky ? !
pinky ? ! i 've been played like a tuneless fiddle at a hoedown .
care to do the hokey-pokey ?
pinky , i built this for you .
i hope ya like it .
egad ! my own fedor-a-matic ?
no , my darling !
a giant water park ! with slippery slides and bumper boats !
oooh , brain ! can we ride the bumper boats ?
can we ?
can we , plee-ee-ee-ease ?
you don 't need brain 's permission , pinky .
i don 't ? no !
your days of being bopped on the head
and kowtowing to brain 's every whim are over !
they are ? yes !
boys ?
gee , that looks like kicks , goony-goon .
alone at last !
ha ha ha ha ! oh , you 're not alone , billie .
i 'm here !
and now i can give you the greatest gift of all .
a hat squished down all tingly-wingly around my head ?
no , silly !
me !
well ... what do ya think ?
you want to take over my world , big boy ?
um , er , uh , uh ,
i--i--i--i--i-- i 'll have to ask brain if it 's ok .
he was some kind of a mouse .
hey , dad , what 's that ?
the world 's first water park .
it sure looks swell .
what are we waiting for ?
brain , voice-over : well , this is where you came in-- with me in the drink like somebody 's dirty laundry .
pinky , voice-over : ooh ! i hope they separated the undergarments .
come , pinky .
we must towel off and prepare for tomorrow night .
gee , brain , what are we going to do tomorrow night ,
construct a machine to make our pants really tight ?
no , pinky .
the same thing we do every night--
try to take over the world !
snowball : if i don 't beat you to it .
get your hand off of me , you damp , hairy hamster !
as you wish .
* they 're dinky , they 're pinky *
* and the brain , brain , brain , brain , brain *

- corbeii , we have a problem
- help me !

those guys are scattered all over the world
except lefiaguais who 's dead
a signal

the tv again ?

she gave me another clue :
" the last victim will act as a compass "
- that 's all fine and dandy lapointe but i 've got documents in the car
- did you read them ?
- no , i 'm going to right now
- shit , biron !
do you have a record ?
- what ?
- a criminal record ? - why ?
- fingerprints !
- never mind
- i didn 't know a little " home-made " alcohol in the bottles would make them sick
if they didn 't drink so much in the first place
now two of them have stomach cancer but it 's not my fault
- hold on buddy :
i think some of them have two words for you - come on guys , you know me better than that
i never did that
well , well , look who we have here

- who fired ?
- who 's with you ?
- i 'm with mom
- suzanne !
- almost over almost over
- i 'd take money in my register every time

- congratulations
- thanks
i 'm sorry about what happened to blanche and your wife
- blanche said you 'd come and talk to me about this
- i thought blanche 's stories
- some days i manage not to believe them
- want some ?
- you lost your wife too , eh ?
- yeah
- so , what was it you wanted to tell me ?
- i don 't really know
i thought maybe you could help me with my investigation or to understand why blanche chose me , why i 'm here
forget it
- look , bianche would probably tell you that the answer is right before your eyes
- thanks
as far as compass goes , doesn 't get any better
- i had to come
- that 's ok , i 'm glad you 're here
- i 'm sorry about this afternoon
- i don 't want you to explain , catherine
you asked me before if i believe it 's possible to start over
well now , with you , i think i couid
- what 's going on ?
- the whole town is blabbing on tv
one scandal after another
they take turns beating on each other
nothing very interesting
- hey , moron
that 's you on tv
- we 're real good friends
- i 'm exhausted
- why don 't i escort you to your bed ?
- no , with you , i forget everything ;
i don 't feel as tired
- i didn 't say we 'd sleep
- not my place , not now
- it 's " badaboom " mrs
badaboom was more than his dog
i
i didn 't see him
i ran him over
- badaboom ?
that was you , moron ?
- yes
- badaboom ?
but why didn 't you tell me ?
- i couldn 't , i felt so bad
- come here
forget about it
badaboom would have wanted it that way
- yeah , ok
- those documents don 't exist anymore , eh , beiiveau ?
- i kept them - i know why you kept them because you 're afraid of me
a real female
i misjudged you
i 'm willing to bet that journalist had something to do with this
- lapointe ?
no , he - not lapointe
biron lapointe wouldn 't have left prints all over the place
check if they match biron 's file and we have to find him right now
send someone to the hydroplanes
there 's only one road leading out of great bear , right ?
- olson road to the forty-four about a hundred miles in the woods
- i 'ii put up a roadblock
if this gets out , do you realize how much shit we 'ii be in because of you ?
they 'ii be looking for a scapegoat and i 'm not going down alone ,
- yes sir
i 'ii be there as soon as i can
yes
if i 'm there tomorrow , i 'ii be on lapointe 's tv show
this is big simone , bigger than the lambert case ;
- it 's your turn emiie
what the lambert case did for lapointe 's career , this scoop will do for yours , honey
- but
lapointe ; do you really think
- you think he would have shared the spotlight on a case like this ?
- don 't rely on appearances
lapointe is a bit harsh sometimes but deep down he 's a good guy
- emile , without that scoop , his career is over
- that 's why it wouid be a rotten thing to
- he might be a good guy but he 'ii take all the credit because he can 't afford not to
don 't you get it ?
they sent him to great bear to get rid of him , he said so himself
- i don 't know
- emile
you 're just a pawn to him
what do you think 's gonna happen if you show up there together ?
it 'ii be : " hello lapointe !
leave your shadow in the coatroom "
- hey
i led the investigation into the iumberjacks
that 's my doing
- that 's all i 'm saying , kitten
it 's your turn
- it 's about time i got out of here
- biron
biron ?
he probably thought this would be the first place the cops would come looking for him
the key is at the front desk
- coast is clear , they 're gone
- you 're booking me ?
- hurry up , he can 't be far
- what 's the motive ?
- we 'ii deal with it at the station
- they must have the hydroplanes under surveillance
i can 't take the road
- i have an idea
- did you find him ? - no
- i want my lawyer !
- miss , i apologize for the brief delay , but be assured that
i want my lawyer !
- what lawyer ?
- hello what ?
- did you see what 's on tv ?
- i don 't watch tv anymore
- i 'm sure it wouid cheer you up
- there 's only one thing that would cheer me up
- does this make my ass look fat ?
- hello ?
hi gastonne , how are you doing ?
- how am " i " doing ?
well
we emptied the place and filled up the hospital
where are you ?
- somewhere safe
- what did you find ?
is my father involved ?
be honest
- no
- no ?
- i mean i didn 't find anything compromising on anybody
i don 't think i took the right documents
- shit !
- i know
- it 's still breaking and entering
- i can 't talk to you
the cops are here
- ok , don 't move emiie
- i can 't do this
- come on emiie , it 'ii grow back
- but my pride won 't
- what does that mean ?
- look at me
i just lied to my best friend
i 'm betraying lapointe i 'm lying to my childhood idol for god 's sake !
- emile , don 't start this again
- i won 't start again
i swear i won 't start again
- kitten
- heiene
we found him
- my husband ?
- he 's in the hospital
get dressed , i 'ii
biron
- hey !
this is georges ferron !
hurry up and find him a room he paid for this hospital
- it 's all right christian
it wasn 't a heart attack , just a little warning
- a heart attack ?
you told me
- it 's nothing ; she just told you
- but dad
- make a man of yourself !
- yeah , yeah
- how 's our business going ?
- dove will be here this morning , with the money
she 's already taken a liking to me
we 'ii do it in broad daylight
she 'ii be a friend of mine visiting
we make the trade , no hassle ;
she sleeps at the hotel , no worries
- did you think of that yourself ?
- sure did !
i even arranged a surprise reunion with an old friend of hers
- what did i tell you about armand ?
he 's not worth
- not worth it ?
armand 's share is twenty thousand bucks !
- what do you do if she shoots him in the middle of the street ?
- no , she doesn 't suspect a thing
got her wrapped around my little finger
guaranteed
armand !
armand !
open up
hold me
- how 's it going ?
we can do this another day if you want ; i 'm in no hurry
- if you made me come over here to see me abandoned and miserable ; go ahead , take a good look
- no is an unexpected pleasure
- what are you doing here if you haven 't done anything ?
- you have no scruples getting murderers off , but the innocent
- if you have to whip me some more
i told you , i 'm sorry about your wife , and i regret getting the guy off
- aii right , all right
i believe you
- what ?
- i forgive you
- you say that because the bars keep you from strangling me ?
i 'm not doing it for you ;
if you only knew how much better i feel , not hating you
- i can believe that
ok
- actually , they don 't want me ; it 's biron they 're after
- biron ?
why ?
- they think he 's got compromising documents
- compromising for who ?
- for national security why , i don 't know yet but it has to do with the helicopter accident that killed the iumberjacks ten years ago
- that ugly statue in front ?
- yeah , that 's it in fact , they have no intentions of letting me go until they have biron and the documents
- ok , so what am i doing here ?
- you play along but
while they were interrogating me , i overheard some info :
listen at ten o 'ciock sharp
- wouidn 't it be better to tell them to send backup ?
- if they learn what 's going on , not only do i lose the case i 've dedicated my iife to , but you 'ii lose your eyes , ears and what 's left of your balls ; in that order
in eight seconds
special agent corbeii , colonel
edouard paquette and robert beiiveau are also present
i 'm fully aware this is a delicate case , but i have the situation under control
paquette and beiiveau can testify to it
- yes
- blanche von trieck 's murderer is someone who has a high caliber scientific formation and who has been in contact with professor paquette 's research
he succeeded in reproducing and improving the technology developed by paquette
he was able to make a copy of his victim 's brain
avirtuai copy
- a copy of her brain - that 's what they said but i don 't have all the details
- glad to run into you
- i have to be somewhere but i 'ii be back later
but i 'm warning you biron ;
i 'm leaving great bear tomorrow
- come on armand
lapointe - lapointe , follow the constable : you 're free to go
- come on lapointe
- don 't worry biron , we 'ii get you out of here
- well , i sure hope so !
gastonne , gastonne you can 't leave me here
- that 's not so bad , all they have on you is driving under the influence
you 'ii end up with three months and community service , maximum
- no , gastonne i lied to you
i did read the documents
they 'ii want to kill me , i swear !
they already have killed a dozen others ;
- what were those papers ?
- your friend biron didn 't tell you ?
- he didn 't read them
anyway , i want to hear it from you
what happened to the iumberjacks ?
of course : you never trusted me
you 're not about to start today
- you want me to trust you but - yes
- can you keep a secret ?
it wasn 't supposed to be that way
they asked me for twelve guys , preferably unemployed , with no wives , no kids
- no future
- i ran an ad :
" dangerous job , lots of quick money "
i knew exactly who would show up
before they got on the helicopter ,
corbeii offered them five times their pay if they agreed to participate in an experiment
they all signed up
sam first
after a few days , i went up to see what was going on
the guys had lost their minds
when i got a hold of sam
come on !
come on sam !
sam , sam , listen listen sam
you have to get out of here while you still got cells !
- still got cells
- go on !
then they arranged for the accident
- and you didn 't say anything
- no !
are you insane ?
you have to help me gastonne
do this for your father
if all this gets out
- " still got cells " ;
that 's the sentence which got us started on the right track
- yes , i know
i liked sam
you see where feelings get you ?
you always say i have a heart of stone
but i got sam out ; that proves
please , don 't make me regret the only time i followed my heart
- you already regret it
you can 't turn your father in
help me
you 're a cop dad
you 're supposed to protect people
- you 're the only person i can count on
- you say i 'm not a good cop
take a look at yourself
- they 'ii lock me up for the rest of my iife for a mistake that , even if i wanted to , i can 't fix
- i 'ii think about it
- thanks
listen and the bar are yours but
- relax dove
i have a surprise you 're gonna like
- oh yeah ?
- there you are !

- i said give me my bag , now !
armand !
we can finally settle this
look at me !
- please

this is all i wrote you since
half are love letters , half are death threats :
they 're for you
- why ?
- because it took a iong time but
i want nothing to do with you
nothing with your love , nothing with your death
they 're yours
- you knew i was here ?
- you 're the only one who called me dove
- dove , you know
- kiss me
kiss me one last time , then goodbye
- goodbye
- stef , put that down
- who is she ?
- this is dove : my ex
- that 's right , i am his ex
- i 'm sure it 's true
funny how easy it is to get the truth when you 're holding this eh ?
funny
i should have tried this before eh ?
i would have known a iot faster that you led mom to her death
- who told you
you know i didn 't want to hurt her
i just wanted her to know
- don 't swear in front of me
- i would have told you but dad
- what you told me was that you don 't ever want me to try to help you
count on me
i don 't think there 's anything left for me to know , right ?
unless there 's something else you 're hiding , eh armand ?
- careful
- i wasn 't talking to you
she seems to know what she 's talking about eh ?
is that what excites you ?
a chick with a gun ?
am i turning you on , armand ?
- stef
- what are you waiting for ?
don 't you see she 's crazy about you ?
- not loaded ?
you know , i really do like you
- so , are you going to show me your big - that 's right , i am his ex .
- here , didn 't you ordered this ?
- yes
- i haven 't felt like this in so long
i mean , i 'm with you but
- goes back a iong way
- yeah aii this time , i thought the clues from blanche were leading me to a criminal
when in reality , they were leading me to you
doesn 't matter
hello ?
- lapointe ?
- yes
- blanche 's killer it 's catherine
lapointe ?
it 's catherine ! it 's catherine
- avery bad cycle has begun
- sophie !
- here
i don 't know the meaning of these sentences but i know they will help you , one by one , to save my soul
- georges , your son is completely stoned
- i have a feeling we 'ii get along , you and i , christian
- there 's no doubt
the waves producing the images on tv are of identical nature to the ones i was obtaining with my device , ten years ago
- i did things i would never do with him
i just want him back , bianche
- heiene , heiene
- who could be doing that ?
aii of my ex-coiiaborators have been contacted , it 's beyond me
- don 't you find that strange ?
a neurologist to fix a tv signal problem ?
- if there 's a link between the two stories , we have a hell of a scoop
the only concrete facts we have are the article about edouard paquette found in doctor mondoux 's hand and the missing file on the iumberjacks
- if the documents aren 't there , he decided it
- we have to open beiiveau 's safe
- the problem is that he 's the only one who has the key
and he always keeps it on him
- you wanted louis-bernard lapointe for your gala ?
you shall have him
- out of the question !

hunting season hasn 't started and i hate wild game
- hunting is good for the nerves
- i 'ii calm down when the deal 's done and when armand is
- never mind armand stephanie doesn 't want him anymore ; he has nothing left here he 'ii leave on his own
- i don 't understand why we should give him his share
- because you don 't rob a guy from the iast thing he 's got
you of all people should know that
- aside from that , i have a problem with catherine
- be patient with her
there are a iot of things you don 't know about her
i asked her to marry me
- huh ?
- you heard me
- you asked her
and what did she answer ?
- i iove her and don 't take me wrong but i iove her more than i ever loved your mother
that journalist is cozying up to her
he 'ii get out of the way , trust me
- is that why we 're here , so you could tell me this ?
- what ? afather and his son can 't hunt together without
i just want you to know that sometimes , you have to feel like you 're losing things to really appreciate them
give me your shades
the sun 's in my face
- here dad
are you all right dad ?
- yes , yes , i 'm all right
- i got it
- you got it dad let 's go get it
- thanks for the flowers , last night
and the note
- you weren 't home
- i was there
- i 'm going a little too fast , is that it ?
- georges , my sister 's husband , thinks that once you know me better , you 'ii dump me
- isn 't he a little biased ?
- still , he 's probably right
- do you really think this is a sex game ?
honestly catherine ;
i 'm not twenty years old anymore
although i might appear to be
- there 's no age for chasing skirts
but that 's not the point
- oh , by the way i 'd rather you wouldn 't be at the gala , tonight
i 'm about to do something that i wouldn 't want you to see
- and i 'm about to show you something i never thought i couid show
- catherine , what 's wrong ?
i don 't know what you want to show me but can it wait ?
- i won 't have the courage twice
- go away , go away
- catherine calm down
- please , please
- ok , i 'ii leave
fights , special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
attention , everyone
- i 'm fed up , man
we should have recorded it
- now you think of that ! damn idiot !
- why don 't you shut up ?
- when will you learn to mind your own business ?
- what is heiene doing in the interrogation room , have you seen what state she 's in ?
- she appeared on tv , iike the other three , we 're looking for a connection
- in the mean time , what do we do about marcoux ?
it 's been three days since he disappeared
- i won 't send out a search party every time a cheated husband slams the door
- but dad , it 's marcoux
- i 'ii tell you one last time gastonne ;
you take things too personal
if you want to become any good at this job
- you think i 'm no-good too ?
- what you need to be a cop is a cool head , common sense and a gun
you 're my daughter but all you 've got is the gun
monette ?
monette it 's me
say , do you know wrestling ?
what the hell is a " death hammer " ?
- so , how are things going ?
any headway ? - i 've wasted my time
they have no idea why they appeared on tv and they have nothing in common
aside from the weirdo and the nymphomaniac , they barely know each other
the boxer is a retard
the bi-gendered hairdresser is completely insane
the woman only talked about her husband who left her
and the kid wasn 't saying anything
- what have you learned since you 've been here ?
- what is blocking the tv signal is a magnetic field
- yes but we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmitting from
the antenna on the mountain ?
- i checked
to locate the source , we would need to intercept the signal
this means climbing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmitting at that moment
- i 've already called georges ferron to go with you
beiiveau and i , we have to prepare a first report , and we have nothing to give them
so if you find anything new
hello ?
- hello my handsome christian
it 's dove
- hello babe !
i was just thinking about you
- well , well
- about you
- i was calling to tell you i 'ii be arriving tomorrow ,
i 'ii be alone
- tomorrow ?
tomorrow 's fine
alone ?
you 're brave
- i decided to trust you christian
- you shouldn 't
- i 'ii be a friend of yours visiting from montreal
we 'ii do this in broad daylight
real smooth
- you know
i really do like you
- thanks , i forgot it
i can 't be without that clip
step right up ladies and gentlemen !
an evening filled with excitement awaits you
come in and see spectacular fights
we have wrestling , we have boxing we have plenty of tv 's so you won 't miss anything if someone else appears
step right up !
- it 's up to you
- hey !
there 's a girl here !
- she 's not a girl , she 's a cop
- careful , her boyfriend is a hairdresser
- you mean her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- you can 't leave tonight pierre
- i 'ii take a plane tomorrow :
that will be one less freak in great bear
- at least tell me what you saw in blanche 's book
- it isn 't blanche 's book
- will you just explain then ?
- you looked
you 'ii pay the price , great bear will pay
go away
- tell me who blanche 's heiress is
why didn 't her powers get passed on ?
- you 'ii know nothing
- i feel that blanche 's soul is trapped
help me free her
pierre , help me help blanche
- you don 't understand
- no , i don 't understand
pierre ?
- her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- here
- thanks
- don 't let it get to you
they 're all afraid they are freaks too , on the inside
they all are a little , and they know it
it soothes them to see people who are on the outside
- when blanche was here , we could just go see her
- hey , it 's starting !
ladies and gentlemen !
welcome to
- in the spotlight , idiot
- welcome to the von trieck hangar , site of the most incredible entertainment
- this better be worth it , bianche , or you 'ii hear from me in the great beyond
- and now ladies and gentlemen , the first fight of the evening will oppose : in the blue corner ,
" bobby the mayor " beiiveau
and in the red corner , " luigi big star " lapointe
that wasn 't in the script
- hey , i just had a concussion here
- people are supposed to root for me
- be careful
put everything exactly back where you got it
if he notices anything , we 're done for
- will we have time ?
- yes , maryse is alone here until six o 'ciock
- you think pierre will be able to ?
- he read the book , he had visions
if anyone is capable of saving blanche 's soul , he is
we must do it before he leaves
- how many fingers ?
- everyone remembers the words ?
- hey , can you see my finger ?
- he 's knocked out
- move away
- no , no , no !
- where are we at ?
- " death hammer "
- mrs
why didn 't you tell me ?
- pierre , help me !
help me !
- blanche ?
you were right
" where the thief dances "
- i didn 't know what the sentence meant when i wrote it
- but you were right
- if you want but now i 'm here to tell you i was wrong
- tell me everything
who killed you , who killed dr the tv , the book
- you 're the one who must answer those questions
aii i can tell you now is this :
i 've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes her discoveries
i have also told you that most of us want to do good , not evil
unfortunately , every thirteenth generation , there is an evil witch
she writes the thirteenth chapter , a bloody chapter , full of maiedictions
- mom ! stop !
stop , she can 't take it anymore !
- for thirty years , i wrote the twelfth chapter of my book
i couldn 't accept that when i died i would have to give my powers to an evil one
so i decided to change the course of things and to skip the thirteenth chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
i chose my son 's wife
she accepted to submit herself to a iong and hard treatment
she fought alone against a thousand demons
i pushed her to the end , in the hopes to save a generation against forces of evil
- leave diane alone , is that clear ?
- i failed
thomas lost his wife
sarah lost her mother
the whole town lost a friend
one last thing
the last victim will serve as a compass
- the last victim will serve as a compass
thanks pierre
now listen
- apparently there are a iot of bears in the area
- yeah
a iot
- november 5th , vote beiiveau
- and now , the moment you have been waiting for ;
the fight opposing , in the red corner , the former canadian champion , medium weight :
jean-guy poitras
and in the blue corner
you ! - dad !
dad you can 't let that happen
he doesn 't have a permit for this
- come on , can you see me trying to take away their show ?
they already hold me responsible for the tv
- dad , you can 't , you can 't !
- leave me alone
- ok , you 're right
good night - calling me a fag , huh ?
very brave when you 're twelve against one with baseball bats , but face to face
come on you cowards , i have one hand tied behind my back
come on , big guy , iet 's go !
- you put everything back exactly in its place ?
- yes perfectly
- we have a volunteer ladies and gentlemen :
rick cyr
- aii right !
hey
- thanks biron
corbeii , we have a problem
- what do we do now ?
- we wait
hoping that the madman who transmits on great bear 's waves sends another episode
- the madman might be just a joker
- trust me
to do what he does , one must be deranged
- and you designed the device ?
you experimented on humans ?
- i was doing research on mental imagery
corbeii 's the one who pushed me
- she stroked my ego
i was going to make history
national security offered me a laboratory , volunteer test subjects
i fell for it
- quit whining
do you know what 's going on ?
- someone pushed my research further
i was able to read the nerve influx of the rats to project images
but i was never able to search their memories
i never had the intention to broadcast
- so the rabbits on tv
- they must have been test subjects
- but what we 've been seeing on tv that doesn 't come from the mind of a rabbit
what we 've been seeing on tv , logically , must have come from the mind of blanche von trieck
except that she 's dead
- i don 't know exactly how but just before her death , the madman was able make an electronic copy of her brain
it 's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- that guy isn 't a madman , he 's a genius
- yeah , a genius ! who has already killed at ieast two people :
von trieck and dr
- how many have you killed ?
- i never killed anybody , i stopped
they wanted me to continue but i refused
- but still , you must have an idea of who might be doing this ?
- it has to be someone who knows my research
those guys are scattered all over the world
except lefiaguais who 's dead
- lefiaguais ?
- a signal
we 'ii locate the transmitter
- lefiaguais ?
no ! no !
- so
you got to grande ourse two days ago
- you 're sending me to a hole
- out of the blue , you ended up at blanche von trieck 's
- i was waiting for you
- then you took a night stroll with the old woman
- i don 't know the meaning of these sentences but i know they will help you , one by one , to save my soul
- and mine
it 's been a iong time since i 've seen such a beautiful women
i thought the clues were leading me to a criminal
- the last victim will act as a compass
- in reality , they were leading me to you
- lapointe ?
bianche 's killer it 's catherine
lapointe ?
lapointe ! it 's catherine !
it 's catherine , lapointe
catherine open the door !
i know you 're there
- georges
- no catherine !
- catherine !
- get in i have to talk to you
i know
- no , i know
- stephanie
stef
- soon it won 't hurt anymore , you 'ii see
- yes , i need an ambulance at the la forge hotel , room number two
it looks like a heart attack , hurry up
they 're on their way georges
- catherine is not a woman for you
you don 't know her
you don 't know anything about her
- forget about that ok ?
don 't think about that
- listen
she 's the one i ioved
she was 15 , i was 24
i was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off suzanne first , her older sister
it was catherine 's idea ,
i swear
catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
but don 't think she didn 't love her sister
she adored her
it was for her she did all this
suzanne was deranged , almost always off in her own world
she would have ended up alone , unhappy
catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
it went wrong when catherine got pregnant
she cried for weeks , but to protect her sister , she decided to have an abortion
in those days , thomas von trieck 's wife was blanche 's apprentice except that she was using what the learned from blanche to do black magic
catherine went to see her
but the abortion didn 't work
she went off to montreal to have the baby
he was born a vegetable and a gimp
she never forgave herself
she hid him
and she became obsessed she dedicated her life to finding a way to cure our son
she never succeeded
she 's only been back in great bear for two , three years
i thought things were better
- georges where can i find her ?
- you won 't find her
- lefiaguais 's bimbo is here
- yes , that 's it
it looks like catherine , ferron 's sister-in-iaw
- and his mistress
- yes , exactly
- ferron i knew he did it on purpose
- paquette , couldn 't you have thought of that ?
- lefiaguais 's girlfriend ? she couldn 't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amoeba
at least she didn 't look like it
- beiiveau ?
- yes ?
- not you , your daughter
very good work , beiiveau
i will personally see that your efforts be rewarded by a promotion
- thanks
- this is a very serious case
you saw what happened in great bear , on a small scale ?
if the discoveries of what 's her name ?
- catherine lapiante
- if lapiante 's discoveries were found out , if they ended up in the wrong hands
do you understand ? - yes
- we have to act quickly so that despite a few errors committed in the past , the information concerning this case remains secret
- that i can 't
- sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the lesser of two evils
in this case , it 's better to leave the deaths of a few iumberjacks unpunished than to risk that dangerous technologies end up in the hands of terrorists , or
- got it !
i found the coordinates of the transmitter that broadcasted those images last night
- forget what you know about the iumberjacks
it won 't bring them back ;
it 's all in the past we need you , right now
- you won 't regret it , captain beiiveau
- chief , someone stole a body from the morgue
- who 's body ?
- blanche
a bunch of people took her
they 're freaking out because of the tv they want to bury her
- come on !
- beiiveau , i want my lawyer !
i want my lawyer !
i want my lawyer
- buy us some time
let him see armand but no one else
- catherine ?
- what are you doing here ?
- i was looking for stephanie
she got in the car with catherine and i can 't find her
what 's this ?
- catherine it can 't be true
- what ? - biron is in danger , your stephanie too
- what do you mean , in danger ?
- come on , i 'ii explain on the way
- he 's my stepbrother ?
- genetically , achilles is even closer to you since i 'm your mother 's sister
but there isn 't a name for that , except " bastard "
- when i found out you 're the one who killed mom , i wanted to kill you catherine , i swear
but now
- revenge doesn 't make the pain go away
only forgiveness can
but people are too weak to forgive
you 'ii feel so much better after
- so , now it 's party time
- i 'ii sleep here tonight
take me out for dinner and
- right
- the images that appeared last night were broadcasted from here
- that 's close to the old mine
- i 'ii take a gps , i 'ii manage
but make sure your daughter stays on our side until biron has his accident
after that she won 't be able to do anything
this might be a very important day , boys !
- what do you think she 'ii do once she can search anybody 's brain ?
- she 'ii spread joy all around the world
- chief !
chief !
- what ? what is it ?
- it 's biron
he hung himself in his cell
oh no !
help !
somebody ! hurry !
open the door ! unlock the door !
oh my god !
ok , i got him go call an ambulance , quick !
- hold on , hold on
- i 'm proud of you son
you handled it like a pro
i can go in peace now
- c 'mon dad
- christian , all i have is yours now
but take care of your sister
- don 't say that dad , our business has just started
we 'ii get more wads like these , you 'ii see
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing
- no , i know there 's something , what is it dad ?
- it 's ok son , it 's experience
- what ?
- counterfeit
- that two-timing little tramp !
- calm down christian
- well , thanks guys
- i 've had this harness since i played the hanging of louis-riei in a college play and now ; an escape
- well , it wasn 't aicatraz , but still
- so now we have to go to the morgue , we have to find stephanie
- the morgue ?
- yes , because the real " last victim " was dr mondoux
there 's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to stef - so , he knows everything now ?
- you 're the one who wanted to split
- yeah but still not two days ago he was " that little brat " and now - get out
- no problem
- the only reason i got you out of there was because i thought your life was in danger because of what you read on the iumberjacks - i didn 't read anything
- hey !
don 't give me that shit
when they got a hold of you , you were fleeing to montreal with the scoop
- yeah
- don 't worry biron , at your age , in those circumstances ,
i would have done the same
- really ?
- but what hurts me is that you didn 't tell me face to face
- i i know
- yeah
- now , don 't tell me you didn 't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or i i 'ii never speak to you again
i really wouldn 't have taught you anything
- well
i took some digital pictures
i have them all right here , on mini-disc
- that 's my biron !
ok , now you can go
- go where ?
- to montreal
- no , i can 't go alone ; you have to come with me
- no , your time has come
you wanted your chance : you got it
- no , no , i couldn 't
- listen ,
i came here to save my soul , not my career
remember ?
- yeah , right
- look , saint-denis will pick you up in half an hour at the crooked lake , ok ?
one last thing
listen , a iong story but
catherine killed blanche and the doctor
- what ?
no
didn 't i tell you not to trust her ?
you really liked her didn 't you ?
i 'm really sorry
- take care of yourself
- yeah , thanks for everything
- what do you mean , the morgue is closed ? - they 've already stolen a body
- who 's ?
- blanche 's
they 're gone to bury or cremate her
they 're the only ones left
- it 's dr mondoux we want to see
- impossible
- the last victim wait !
look these are the marks from paquette and catherine 's device he 's the iast victim
but what does it mean , " the last victim will act as a compass " ?
- armand , if i 've learned one thing here it 's that sometimes
" the last victim will act as a compass " simply means the iast victim will act as a compass
- are you sure ?
- do you have another way to find catherine and stephanie ?
- i 'm telling you , they took the body into the woods
what do we tell her family ? what ?
what ?
i don 't understand ;
let me talk to him
hi , dad ? yes
what do you mean escaped ? - escaped !
he 's gone
i have all the roads under surveillance , the hydroplanes too
he won 't go far but he can talk
- he wants his scoop he won 't talk
except that there 's more than one lake in the area
- i don 't have enough staff to check all the lakes
- saint-denis
- what about saint-denis ?
- he 's coming down
he 's going to crooked lake
- crooked lake
easy , easy
easy
- don 't move biron !
stay here !
- you 'ii take me in
you 'ii send me to my death ? - i have orders you can 't leave great bear
- orders from who ?
your father ?
corbeii ? they 're in it up to here , gastonne
- this is a national security matter
- no , no , this is an anal security matter
those two want to save their asses and you know it
- you 're only thinking of your scoop , you 're not seeing the consequences
- yes , i 'm thinking of my scoop
and the consequences will be the truth will come out and justice will be done
- don 't make me laugh ! there always will be injustice biron
don 't you see ?
it won 't do any good to play don quichotte
stay here - there 's a windmill awaiting me
i know you don 't believe what you say
you 'd iike to save your father but it 's too late
he did what he did
you 'ii have to live with the choices you 're making today as well
- come back
- think about it gastonne
we never will be
but i 've known you for twenty-five years
if there 's one thing i know , it 's that we 'ii never be on the side of the liars and cheaters
you might doubt that today
i still doubted it yesterday
but i iook at myself today , i iook at you and i 'm sure of it
- biron , don 't do this
biron , come back !
biron , i iove you !
i iove you !
i 'm sorry dad
- you shouldn 't be
- my friends
before blanche can join the spirits of the forest , i have to tell you something
- catherine
please !
i forgive you
i don 't want to lose my memories
- poor little girl , you 're scared
but you 'ii feel so much better after
i 'ii only remove the bad ones
you know , at first , i did all this for achilles
with neurology , i was trying to find a way to talk to him to tell him that if i couid start over
but i can 't
so i wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
i didn 't want blanche to die i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
don 't you think ?
- stef ?
- catherine , no
catherine , please
it 's over now , iet me help you
- i can go in peace now
aii i have is yours
- don 't do anything stupid christian ,
look at it as a game
you lost this one , you 'ii win others
- no , no
i can lose them all but not this one
- you 've already all read blanche 's book
- yes
- blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation , the thirteenth chapter , the evil one , so she could pass on her powers to someone good
but she failed
that 's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exists
it will always exist
we have to keep fighting it , all the time , whether it 's inside or outside of ourselves
- ok , but
who would be the thirteenth ?
the bad one ?
- yeah , who 's the heiress of blanche 's powers ?
- for me , there 's no doubt
she 's the thirteenth
sarah von trieck
- don 't you think you 've done enough , pierre ?
first , you disrespect my mother 's body , and now , her granddaughter
this little girl is grieving so much since her grandmother died that she hasn 't said a word
and you want to make her out to be a demon ?
- she 's the one i tell you
i 'm sure , she 's the one
didn 't you hear that ?
she said she wants to kill me !
didn 't you hear ?
- that 's enough pierre go have yourself examined
leave us alone
- you don 't believe me , you 'ii regret it
you 'ii all regret it
- you want to burn her right here ?
- yes
- let 's finish this
- it 's over now
let me help you
- go
you
stay here
- you were hiding a iot of things from me
- i never hid that i hid things
- true
- that i was a monster ?
- no , that 's not it
- admit it , i am a monster in your eyes now , iike in my own
- no , no , no catherine , no
- the look in your eyes was the only hope i had left
- the look in your eyes was what saved me
thanks to you catherine , i 've changed
- sit down
please
- are you all right ?
- do you still love me , in spite of everything ?
- yes , in spite of everything , in spite of my own will sometimes
come on , we 've got to get help
- would you forgive me ?
- i can tell you 're going to break my heart
that , i 'm warning you , i won 't forgive you for
- it 's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- is this a challenge or a warning ?
- a bit of both
i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
- catherine , it 's useless now
- right
it 's useless
- samuel ?
- marcoux ?
bianche ?
- i want to see him again
- very interesting , so to conclude
- those inhumane treatments were forced upon twelve innocent people for highly immoral research
- so , there are still missing chapters to this story
you will be reporting those soon
- oh yes , absolutely , marc
i can already tell you that the topic of this secret research should surprise everyone
- very interesting mr
tune in next week marc bonsecours saying see you soon
- where are you ?
- i 'm in front of blanche 's house - you 're asking yourself if you have saved your soul ?
- if i 've saved my soul ?
well , if it means that i 'm able to look forward despite what 's behind
yes
i think so
- are you going to drop the bottle ?
- well , it 's actually very quiet in great bear , isn 't it ?
- it is except when you 're there
- bye lapointe
- are you there ?
yeah , sorry it was lapointe
i couldn 't - i 'm in my bath too now
- oh yeah ?
sorry , it 's funny because it 's the first time that
i imagine you
- and ?
- well
- to begin i will tell you how i killed my mother
- hey luc
you 're up late again tonight ?
in the iast episode
- avery bad cycle has begun
- if i catch the guy who did this
- we 'ii catch him marcoux we 'ii catch him and he 's going to pay
- the body seems to have been partially buried then dragged on the ground
- you went strolling outside with the old woman , in the middle of the night , without any apparent reason
aii of a sudden , a kind of shadow attacked you you fainted and you never saw her alive again
- mr mayor : you deserve nine out of ten
- sir ? you lost this
you 'ii be needing it
- man , that 's poitras ' face
- i iove giibert
that 's why i 'ii go down after the sixth round against taylor
- ah fuck ! - i 'm not a fag , ok ?
- boys !
- i 'ii call the others
i 'm not a fag
somebody fired a shot
my god , sophie , i 'm sorry
is there anything i can do ?
not one word on what happened , ok ?
i heard a shot , i came right away but there was no one here
he shot himself before someone else did
don 't say that , the guys aren 't crazy
they wouldn 't have killed him for a couple grants
you think ?
not for that either :
look
" i 'm not a fag "
can you believe it ?
what were you all doing here ?
well
we all gather here to talk about blanche
i 've invited you before
bianche is dead
so ?
we can still talk about her
you believe she transmitted her powers , iike she said ?
don 't you ?
i believe in what i see
and these days , the picture isn 't very nice
bianche also believed in what she saw except she saw a iot more and a iot further than we do
i know you 've secretly been to see her too
i beg your pardon ?
once or twice
out of curiosity , iike everyone else
when the bear growls , it will be exactly 9am
you 're tuned in to great bear radio , with simone letendre
so , mr mayor ?
everything is under control
still , there have been three suspicious deaths within a week
i can 't keep people from shooting themselves
i mean
i 'm deeply sorry for the families it 's tragic
as for mrs von trieck , i 'm grieving like everyone else
the investigation is under way but let 's not put the horses before the cart
- ha ! the horses
- still , she 's the most liked and respected woman in town
any leads ? suspects ? anything at all ?
- horses in front of the cart
- the priority is the safety of the population
we obviously have several leads , i can 't give any details
- come on ! come on !
give them details !
- people seem to think that you don 't know the details
what people ?
- everybody
- and what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
people would iike to know when it will come back
i made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
in my days , there was no television
- in other words , you have no clue what 's going on
well thank you mr mayor for the enlightenment - that 's right !
thank you very much you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- poor blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
i 'm starting to understand her
too bad i 'm leaving ; i couid have told you what to do with her
never mind simone
you can 't leave ;
you 're a witness in a murder investigation
might as well make the most of it and do a story
biron , i 'm tired , i need some rest
- do you think we ever got any rest ?
we worked twelve hours a day and at night
nothing ever happens in great bear
then , you come here , there 's a murder , a manhunt , suicides , tv freaks out
biron i have nothing to do with your farfetched tales
- i won 't fetch anything very far , at my age
when i found you last night , there was this paper at your feet
are you writing poetry ? - poetry is boring
but at christmas time , sometimes we 'd sing songs
- yeah , that 's it i write poetry
don 't forget what blanche said ;
your fate is linked to hers
my fate i 'm not dead
what is a dead person 's fate ?
- poor blanche
- follow me , i 'ii show you
- we 'd sing what was it that we 'd sing ?
" the paddle leads us round and round "
the paddle leads us round and round
she got me the old bat !
she got me
and the elections are coming up
fanatics ;
it could cost me my mayor 's job
bianche was all that 's good in the world , all put together in the same person , who would listen to them and guide them
she told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - no way !
- how would you know ?
lapointe 's deposition
yeah , that 's what he told me at the hospital , word for word
big surprise !
why would it have changed ?
what did they teach you at police academy ?
why would he lie ?
bianche left him a paper with clues we should follow
hey , the case is muddy enough without me worrying about the old woman 's hallucinations
forget it !
about suzanne ferron ; i 'm starting to think i 'm wasting my time
proofs were erased , purposely you don 't say ?
by the way the cleaners will be there tomorrow morning , before thomas gets out of the hospital
in the mean time , don 't touch anything and keep your nose out of it
look sarah ; daddy 's in top shape
oh yes !
now i 've got it !
i don 't know why i didn 't think of it sooner !
another stroke of genius ?
hey , hey !
don 't mock me little miss ferron
i 'm thinking of changing my last name
i 'ii take my mother 's
there 's an idea !
your father 's gonna have a cow !
i 'd say it looks like you hate him as much as i do
i 'm sorry about blanche
yeah
i 'm sorry about your mother too
she still hasn 't said a word eh ?
poor child
hey guys !
we 're closing up
i 've got an idea
fantastic ?
extraordinary ?
insane ?
aii of the above !
do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us ? because of what we did with blanche 's book ?
of course not
gilbert thibodeau never needed any help to get into trouble
i don 't feel so good since blanche is gone
everything is backwards and
i 'm scared
you 're too sensitive honey
bianche wouldn 't have liked us playing with forces we can 't control
sophie was putting us on
you really think she left her body and saw blanche with wires coming out of her head ?
she rose above the table , you saw her
well , iet 's keep that between us for now , ok ? yeah
wait for me ; i 'ii give you a lift
i 've never felt that way in all my iife , pierre
i felt myself leave
i don 't know where but i was floating
come here
i think i-i-i 'm gonna go now
pierre , pierre , come lay down , you 're tired
no , no
i felt powerful and free
excuse me
what 's the matter ?
hey !
if you 're gay too , then i 'm the one who 's gonna shoot myself
no , that 's not it
i just can 't ! you 're played the tease long enough
at first , it turned me on but it 's not funny anymore , pierre
it wasn 't my intention sophie , i 'm sorry
if it 's because of gilbert , you know there was nothing left between us i have to go
pierre , i need a man !
i need you
hurry up biron ; i 'm having a shitty day
you better have a good reason to bring me back here
but you 'ii find the " cream of the crop " of great bear here you should enjoy that
i have nothing against cream ;
it 's sour milk i can 't stand
aii right , ok i see everybody 's in a good mood this morning
would you put that on , please gastonne ?
i thought all the tvs in town had nothing but snow ?
yeah but this is just a monitor
there 's no antenna , nothing to receive the waves , it takes it 's signal from the vcr
biron , i know what a monitor is
ok , now , look at this
indeed
look at that
- he can 't leave his wife like this - my vcr was programmed to record when it happened
- so i 'ii go down during the sixth round against taylor that 's fine and dandy but
wait wait wait
- just for him
watch this
what ?
there
well
i 'ii be damned it 's that bear
the old woman 's stuffed bear
that 's right
bianche 's didn 't tape her meetings with people
no , but there 's something there
there 's got to be a link between blanche 's murder and poitras and the tv
and the rabbits that appeared during poitras ' fight
- well , why not ?
it would be logical i don 't know if it 's logical but it reminds me that something 's not right with your deposition
bianche 's big book you were talking about ;
the night she was killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
yes , the book
very nice , with a leather binding
we searched everywhere ;
well , the killer took off with it then ?
i 've got an idea come on biron
hey ! woah !
what idea ?
i don 't work for the police but you 're still a suspect
it 's to your advantage to cooperate
you 'ii get the autopsy report on the old woman ?
give us a copy and we 'ii tell you what we have found on our end
ok , ok
but not a word to my father eh ?
i 'm not supposed to get involved in that
no , no , no
we have a story now , don 't we ?
what 's your idea ? to get the autopsy report
that 's a good one
but what do we do for gastonne ;
we 've got nothing for her you see biron ; we have to reconstitute the events of that night , right ?
we have to speak with blanche 's son ; he was in the house too
the autopsy report should help us reconstruct the facts and put the pieces together
ah , cool but what do we do for gastonne ?
i have to take a shower , biron
come on , iet 's go
a gala ?
a gala ?
a gala
sarah , hand me your drawings
music !
comedy !
fights !
magic !
cocktails ! a memorable evening of entertainment !
people are looking for distractions , it 's gonna fly big !
so we test the show here , then we take it on the road
woah , and sarah ; you did all this to illustrate the evening ?
super , boss !
where do we start ? listen , we need big names
poitras , our champion , is in town
- but poitras he 's , shall we say out of commission
- and grieving
- gilbert - grieving ?
so ?
i 'm grieving too
life goes on guys
life is bigger than everything , guys
live doesn 't stop here eh ?
against the odds !
he must have really loved his giibert
to be this sad with thirty milligrams of morphine in your blood
never seen anything like it
what 's up with you ?
did you call me here to talk about my wardrobe ?
no i want to know how mom died
you know it , dad knows it and i don 't know why you 're protecting him
if he 's threatening you , you 'd better tell me
i 'ii help you that time is over stef
i don 't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
if someone falls down , you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
and when they 're too much of a burden
you take off
look at me look at mom
you 're such an asshole
oh yeah ! that 's another thing ;
i 'm done being nice
as of now , i 'm an asshole
now , if you 'ii excuse me , i have a meeting to get to
- excuse me stephanie ;
i 'm looking for dr mondoux
it 's for an autopsy report
my mother 's ?
no blanche 's
because your mother yes , she was incinerated the same night
i know everybody knows
yeah
anyway
don 't bother gastonne , it 's useless now
according to mondoux , she was partially buried , and then dragged for a good distance after her death
why would a killer bring his victim back in her own house ?
i don 't know
yeah
these marks are identical to the ones you 'd find on the skin of people on whom they tested a device invented by a certain doctor edouard paquette
edouard who ?
paquette
edouard paquette
mondoux has tried to contact him but he couldn 't get a hold of him
- no , no tell mondoux tell him , i 'ii take care of it
everything 's under control
i can help you , trust me what did i tell you ?
there 's no " dad " on the job ok ?
why don 't you go out for a while ?
i have to think now
josee , call agent corbeii from national security , it 's urgent
good ; i taped my stand up
quite a number that one !
soft , vulnerable one minute , cold and cruel the next
i wish i 'd figured her out that quickly
she gets to you doesn 't she ?
yeah , but i 'm done groveiing good for you
i know the type
they use men either as a doormat or as a pedestal
the important thing is that they can walk all over them
in fact , these girls are born unhappy and stay that way
you seem to know what you 're talking about i 've known a iot of women biron
before finding the right one
you , biron
you wouldn 't do that would you ? use someone to get ahead ?
uh no , no
i mean , love has to be an exchange otherwise it 's unhealthy
well , miss catherine
you know , i 've done a iot of thinking , in fact ,
i haven 't slept all night and
i 've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you 'ii accept a date
you bargain your indulgences
ah but it was my friend biron who said that love has to be an exchange
i accept but find something original
that 's another type one should stay away from
that 's more the type you 'ii never get close to , biron
i 'm not interested anyway
where are we going ?
i didn 't see anything the night of the murder
i was at home watching tv and i had a seizure
now , i don 't want to hear about my mother 's scary tales anymore
biron , you should know that
yes but , it 's important , it might be linked to her death
i always said it was going to kill her
i don 't want to hear about her or her books anymore , ok ?
don 't you see i 'm trying to forget ? ah yes , that 's right , she told me she had two big books
you know , with leather bindings
they seemed very important to her
right , two books
according to the stupid legend , my mother 's powers were passed on from one woman to another and they would each write their chapter full of nonsense in there there would be thirteen chapters per book
well now , the the books have disappeared
just as well
honey , we 're in a bit of a hurry right now
what 's the matter ?
kitten ? do you have a fever ?
you 're burning up
you 're all red kitten
in two years , it 's the first time that it 's so
i don 't know
no , no i wasn 't saying
i mean i don 't want to sound corny but
when i wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
i 'ii always remember the first day i set foot in here and blanche introduced us
she knew right away that it wouid work between us , huh ?
we 'ii miss her eh ? oui
sorry
it 's the emotions
that little brat !
where the hell is gastonne ?
about time
here 's the autopsy report
what have you found ?
we spoke to thomas von trieck at the hospital
would you have a pocket-knife or something ?
no , why ?
bianche didn 't have one big book ; she had two
yeah , so ? well , i don 't know
do you have a screwdriver ?
we 'd have to read them to know
we 'd have to find them first
and the piece of paper that blanche gave to lapointe in the woods , did you find it ?
oh , that
hello
i iove you
you 're the only one
i hope so !
christian doesn 't want to see me anymore
i don 't understand ; he hates me
he doesn 't really hate you
aii my iife , all i 've been trying to do is save the world and i can 't do it
that 's not true
you saved me
when you found me ,
i was all messed up with a biker gang after me
without you , i was lost
still today
you 're sweet , but i 'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
from now on , it an eye for an eye
what will revenge get you ?
look at lapointe who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
what was that ?
hey !
moron !
you want me to to book you in ?
thank you
we don 't have much for you but after our visit to the von trieck 's , we should be able to help you biron !
don 't go in there
it 's a secured area
sam
sam
come on , it 's late
- hey ! hello gorgeous !
hi !
hey , guys ! look how nice she is to her little brother
eh sam ?
she 's so nice to you
it 's not lack of respect ; i worry about you
it was an accident
it 'ii pass , we must look ahead
i don 't believe in accidents
and not only for suzanne
when something happens , when someone is born
stop , catherine stop
stop torturing yourself
if only you wanted to
that child is my son too stop !
if only you had wanted
i ioved you so much georges
and for so long it 's not possible anymore
catherine
you and me ; we can 't let it end
it lasted this long , despite everything
take the time to think about it
you should get some rest
yes , you 're right
i have to get some rest
i have to get some rest but
stay right where you are !
from now on , i 'm your partner what ?
i take a third of the profits on everything that 's illegal
i don 't give a damn about
but i have plans for the bar
there 'ii be shows in here we have to hurry
there 's no tv , people need entertainment
but for starters , you 'ii tell me all about the deal you were making when i walked in with mom
i want my share
you have about ten seconds to decide
you want to go to jail ?
fine , i 'ii go too but you 're not going to blackmail me
christian , we can talk about it but
hello , gastonne ?
christian ferron hi
uh what 's up ?
christian ?
christian ?
hello marcoux ?
beiiveau
no , not robert , gastonne , smart-ass !
you 're not on duty tonight
i have a question for you
what 's that ?
honestly
do you think i 'm a good cop ? eh well
that 's what i thought
sophie , where 's your daughter now ?
at her grandmother 's
i think blanche 's soul is still close to us
yes , when i saw her , she was tied up , she seemed imprisoned
imprisoned by what ?
by what , i don 't know
but when giibert
i mean , there was a bang and i fell back down
sophie , sophie , we 'ii just go now
yeah aunt sophie , or we 'ii stay and you can go get some rest
no , no , no we can 't leave blanche in that state
what can we do ?
we have to decode blanche 's book
i 'm sure the answer is in there
her book bianche never allowed us to touch it
yet , she gave it to pierre
why him ?
good question
well , there 's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
bianche gave you that paper you threw it out
then a little boy brought it back to you
and when you were on the verge of giving up , the crazy old man at the restaurant started singing : " the paddle leads us round and round "
biron , that was the purpose of the first sentence
keep me from giving up and keep me here , in great bear yes !
that 's just like blanche
ok read the second sentence
" he who gathers the mane has seen and will see again "
" he who gathers the mane has seen and will see again "
isn 't there a story about some golden mane ?
the mane the mane
according to gastonne 's report , they found nothing in the bear 's fur , nothing in blanche 's hair
it 's not really a mane but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
that 's odd , isn 't it ?
yeah but with all people that come to see her , it 's kind of normal
but biron , there certainly wasn 't twelve people that went under the chair in one day
he who gathers the mane the mane
there must be a hair salon in great bear ?
- who works there ?
it 's it 's
he does
you 're trying my patience son
come on , get the strap !
you never hesitated before !
georges , iet him go
- mr ferron ?
- what do you want mike ?
turn on your tv , quick !
i 'ii let you think about it until tomorrow
it 's not that you 're not a good cop it 's it 's just not natural for you your mind is too nuanced , know what i mean ?
so , to be a good cop , you have to be narrow minded ?
no , seriously , gastonne ; what made you become a cop ?
why ?
you mean , " who made me ? "
you followed someone to the academy ?
i ran away from someone who hurt me
you , the first day you arrived in great bear , you found the woman of your dreams
two years already
i spend my iife in great bear and
- attention all units there 's someone else on tv
it 's
keep an eye out in case things heat up
who is it ?
marcoux ! find that person and make sure they 're safe
so far , it has meant bad luck to
pierre lamy , it 's pierre lamy
it 's pierre lamy
her ?
she doesn 't know
i couldn 't tell her because she loves me and i don 't want her to stop
gastonne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
no
to have both sexes isn 't being a man
i have one ovary and one testicle
i 'm not a man
if you could see it
if gastonne saw it
yes
i 'd rather hurt her
i 'd rather she went away
i 'd rather
anything but that
hey ! imagine that !
you can with yourself
yeah
how do you do it ?
that 's it !
that 's him !
him what ?
that 's why blanche gave him the book
pierre is the heiress to her powers
oh my god !
hello ?
doctor , are you in your office ?
well , yes , obviously
doctor
doctor , tell me you 're alone ?
alone ?
of course i 'm
doctor ?
doctor !
in the iast episode - avery bad cycle has begun
- hold me tight armand
- they can 't stand themselves without tv
look at them !
they 're all watching out for the next scandal
- look at them closely ; they 're shaking they 're all shitting their pants for fear of being the next one
- gastonne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
- what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
- i made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
- paquette is the only one who can help us to understand what 's going on
- he reads the rats ' thoughts ?
- better than that , he turns them into images
- if he knew i slept with practically everything in a uniform in great bear
- well thank you mr mayor you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
- you seem to know what you 're talking about
- i have known a iot of women biron , before finding my own
- see you again soon , mr lapointe
- so , the next one would be : " got cells "
- yeah , well , they 've been in order since the beginning
- got cells , got cells , got cells , got cells , got cells
- come on , come on !
- my glove
that 's armand
stop it sweetheart
mommy 's doing this for your own good
what 's wrong ?
oh no
biron , samuel said : " got cells "
georges , have you seen it ?
what should we do ?
- i don 't know
he hasn 't said anything yet ;
maybe he won 't say anything at all
about us anyway
- i doubt that i 'ii call you back , ok ?
- ok
mommy will be back
madame von trieck ;
promise me that you will never tell stephanie
- armand , what hurts people the most isn 't what we tell them but what we don 't
- no
if i told stephanie i 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that i do worse things than before , she wouldn 't understand that i 'm doing it for her
- i know
- no , you don 't
- yes
her name is dove
she 's beautiful and wild and she 's after you because you betrayed her
that 's why you 're hiding in great bear
- but how
- you told stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- it 's true i didn 't want anything to do with the business anymore and dove had put a hit on my head
- yes , beautiful dove is mad at you , but it 's not a business matter :
it 's her heart you betrayed
like you 're betraying stephanie by not telling her
- no i iove her
- yes , and you will tell her
- no !
never !
- oh yes , i can see it
she will learn everything from your own mouth
never trust anyone , sarah
no one
ah !
lapointe
biron , she kissed me , right here !
- good for you in the mean time , heiene marcoux 's brother said the fourth sentence
and armand lafiamme appeared on tv
this is where you were coming from the other day
- you must be very careful ; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bicycle
- hey , don 't give me orders , buddy
- hey , calm down !
i wouldn 't have expected that from you
i only told them who to call to find the material and the ingredients
from there , it 's just a recipe
hello ?
yes , armand is here what ?
ok , fine we 'ii wait here
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing we wait here
- what 's going on ?
- i told you , nothing
hey , what do you do with that ?
- you are the worst liar i 've ever heard
- don 't you get it ?
the days when you pretended to be a good boy and fucked my sister are over i 'm the boss now
you 're acting just like your father and you always said he was a dumb-ass
- you never stop , do you ?
my father said to wait here
i don 't know what 's going on but if something 's happened to stephanie
you believe pierre 's story now ?
- biron , i said , " let 's suppose "
listen to this
the night she died ,
bianche leaves with me for the woods , ok ?
meanwhile , pierre goes into the house to look in the book
in the woods , someone knocks me out , kills the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught , probably by sarah and her friends , who , according to pierre , brought the body home
so , chances are sarah saw the killer
- well , probably probably according to pierre there 's a chance
come on , that story will never fly
- no , no , biron
it would explain the footprints in the kitchen , the haif-done burial and the return of the body to the house
- let 's suppose , iike you say
but it 's probably after ten o 'ciock right now
little sarah , who doesn 't speak , is probably asleep
and according to me , chances are stephanie won 't welcome you with much hospitality
- ah ! biron , you 're absolutely right
- right
- so
oh no !
that girl intimidates me
- biron , all girls intimidate you
- hi
- hi
this might seem strange but it 's a iong story but
i 'd iike to talk to sarah - sarah 's in bed
come back some other time if you want to play with her , ok ?
- it 's really important
i i have some questions for her
biron , she hasn 't said a word
yes , i know but
that idiot lapointe sent you , is that it ?
can 't he mind his own business ?
- no , that wasn 't him
i mean i 'm quite capable of myself
i just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- she saw someone take off on a four-wheeier
that 's all
- on a four-wheeier
- the little brat is here !
come on biron !
armand
stef !
are you ok ?
i thought something had happened to you
- you were right
just tell me you 're not associated with my father
oh no oh no
- what is it ?
- i saw him he can 't be very far
- who ?
- got him !
come here !

but it was worth it to see you smiling again !
saito-san ...
oh , you 're welcome !
mom used to say , " from that day on , yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar , and played it every single day . "

woman : oh , thank you . thank you for curing me , dr .
freud .
thanks to your miracle technique ,
i am no longer delusional . it 's called hypnosis , fraulein .
i took you back to re-experience your childhood .
whatever you did , it worked . i used to think that little men were following me around ,
but now i know that little men were just in meine imagination .
[ doorbell rings ] ach . excuse me , fraulein .
you stand lookout while i write my name
in dr .
now , fraulein , where were we ? aaah !
the little men ! the little men ! they 're back !
bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl ... aaah !
hmm . you know , you might want to think about another appointment .
aah ! what are we going to do now , brain ?
ring some more doorbells and run away ? no , pinky . ohh !
to see the great hypnotizing psychiatrist
dr. sigmund freud .
oh , bravo , brain .
you 're finally getting some help
for that problem of yours--
look , pinky , i 'll explain this one more time . my appointment with dr .
freud is only a ruse . when he tries to hypnotize me ,
i will use a pair of mirrored glasses to reverse the process ,
thereby hypnotizing freud himself . egad ! brilliant , brain !
then you can make him wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey .
pinky , how would that possibly help us
to take over the world ?
well , actually , i was thinking of it
more as entertainment . poit .
all vienna knows that the emperor franz josef
is being treated by freud for depression .
when freud is under my spell ... unh ! i will order him to hypnotize the emperor into giving me , the brain ,
his right to the imperial throne ,
allowing me to take over the world !
[ squeak ] [ plop ] uhh ! ooh !
they 're right in here with all the fun , fun games
i brought to play with in the waiting room . zort !
[ gasps ] oh , look .
i 've got jacks and wind-up toys
no ! don 't leave me !
well , what about all this stuff ? boring . been there , done that .
well , make small talk with that man over there
and give me my mirrored glasses .
um ... hi . let 's see . um ... do you know anything about lilliputians ?
excuse me ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm just trying to make small talk . ach , don 't trouble yourself .
i 'm just a sad little sad man . life brings me nothing but dreary sadness .
i 'm sad all the time . boy , am i sad .
well , i brought a pair of googly-eye glasses . they 'll cheer you up .
oogedy-boogedy ! ha ha ha ha ha ! narf !
but all i see is my own dreary , sad little sad face .
poit .
these aren 't my googly-eye glasses .
these are mirrored gla-- [ gasps ]
uh-oh . you are getting sleepy ... very sleepy .
no , no . you are getting sleepy .
[ boing ] hey , take off those ridiculous glasses .
huh ? now , where were we ? ah , yes .
you are getting sleepy . wait .
pinky has my other glasses . i--i need them .
you don 't need glasses to be hypnotized . oh , yes . really , i ...
have ... to ... get ... them . i ...
yes .
let yourself go .
must remember to ... hurt pinky at first opportunity .
no .
you don 't want to hurt anybody . we are going to discover who hurt you . we are going back to your childhood .
going back ... back .
you are in a deep sleep , ja ?
ja .
i mean ... yes . i want you to think about a time when you were very young .
freud : where you are , brain ? brain :
in a field , playing . how old are you ? just a child ,
not a care in the world .
[ grunts ]
[ snap ] [ clatter ]
[ grunts ]
suddenly i 'm being chased ,
hunted down like some sort of rabid dog .
terrified , i run home to my parents .
they rush to my aid , but my assailant is overpowering . i was taken from my home
and sent to a research facility .
as i entered those doors , the carefree innocence of my youth
was snuffed out like a candle ,
replaced with unremitting darkness . lab-coated goons tried to break our spirits and brainwash us into submission .
others emerged from the experience ... not quite all there .
narf ! zort ! hee hee hee hee !
the slightest insolence resulted in punishment both swift and brutal .
[ mice gasp ] more ? you want more ?
aah .
aah !
i never met a man i didn 't meet .
aah !
the problem with congress is ... they 're all liars .
aah ! make it stop !
and how did that make you feel ?
angry ... like i wanted to ... to take over the world .
hmm . emotional displacement . obviously , you were missing the comfort of your home .
it 's ... a tin can .
there 's something on the side of it , a ... a picture .
no . no . i--i mean , i--i can 't tell .
it 's a picture of ... of ... the world ! and then they dragged me away . and you want your world back .
it 's simple . yes . [ snap ] what ?
where am i ? your problem is simple , herr brain . you just want to go home .
i don 't ? i don 't ? [ click ] ok , time 's up .
" how to hypnotize anyone .
create a relaxing atmosphere . "
okey-dokey , you sick little puppy . move it . i got another client .
oh , there 's not enough time for this .
[ smack ] oh !
oh , no . what have i done ?
oh , no . what have i done ? yes !
you 'll obey my every command . i will obey .
is nothing but cheap nostalgia .
maybe all i 'm really longing for is ... is ... a rusty tin can .
what a quack . ha ha ha ha ha ! narf !
oh , very good , mr . elephant . zort !
ach , herr pinky , i 'm having the most exciting fun
for the first time in my dreary , sad life . ha ha ha ha ! ha ha ha ha !
narf ! ha ha ha ha ! ha ha ha ha !
i will hypnotize the emperor franz josef and order him to make brain his successor .
perfect . when i snap my fingers , you will awaken .
[ snap ]
ach !
herr brain , it 's late .
you made good progress today .
more than you know , doctor .
oh , come over any time , herr pinky .
here is meine card .
auf wiedersehen . gesundheit ! who 's your new friend , pinky ?
" his most imperial emperor franz josef " ?
pinky , that 's the man i wanted freud to hypnotize .
oh , he doesn 't want to be hypnotized now , brain .
since i taught him all my favorite games , he says he 'll never need therapy again .
i believe i need therapy , pinky , to find out why i hang around with a nut like you .
come . we must go back to the lab
and prepare for tomorrow night . why , brain ? what are we going to do tomorrow night ?
try to shrink your head ? no , pinky ,
the same thing we do every night , no matter how forcefully the purveyors of psychobabble
attempt to dissuade us-- try to take over the world !
♪ they 're dinky ♪ ♪ they 're pinky and the brain ♪
♪ brain , brain , brain , brain ♪
assuming a standard height-to-weight ratio
and a 3-point margin of error ... pinky : ha ha ha ha !
[ synthetic laughter ] factor in g-force and wind shear
of each downward thrust ... ha ha ha ha !
[ synthetic laughter ] that does it !
pinky , what are you doing ? ha ha ha ! oh , poit !
i 'm playing with my new " tickle me herbert " doll , brain . you just tickle him here ,
and he laughs and laughs . kootchie kootchie kootchie ! [ synthetic laughter ]
well , put it away .
i can hardly hear myself think .
maybe you 're just not thinking loud enough , brain . pinky , may i see that for a moment ?
sure--uhh !
[ synthetic laughter ] [ laughter fades ]
oh , brain , i think he likes you .
zort !
now maybe i 'll have the quiet i need
to finish perfecting my latest plan .
you might say we 're going fishing .
and all the stuff you need for keeping bees .
that 's not fishing . ha !
oh , that 's skiing . try to focus , pinky .
this is the finnious japonicus ,
commonly known in japan as mugu .
one bite of its tail renders anyone who eats it
unable to move for 24 hours .
i had a linoleum sandwich last week that made me feel the same way , but shiny .
and place it over your mouth . [ muffled ] ok .
my plan is simply this--
i will capture a pair of mugu , breed them , and market the tails throughout the world as cappy brain 's frozen fish sticks .
while the populace is immobilized ,
i shall implement my plan of world domination . there 's only one catch .
oh ?
well , that won 't be enough to feed the whole world , then , will it ?
[ muffled ] sorry . the japonicus is so rare
that the only known specimens
are those bred in captivity for the dining pleasure of japan 's most elite sumo wrestlers .
[ muffled question ]
if you 're going to speak , pinky . oh .
[ muffled question ] i have anticipated your query , pinky .
i plan to become one of japan 's most elite sumo wrestlers . observe .
narf !
[ gasps ] the " tickle me dom deluise " ?
oh , why , that 's the most expensive one .
look closer , pinky .
to fit the precise specifications
of a champion sumo wrestler .
with the adjustments i 've made ,
i 'll be able to flip a 600-pound man .
won 't you need an awfully large spatula for that ?
don 't forget to pack your doll
when we go to japan , pinky .
i might feel the need
noogie . give him the noogie .
noogie , noogie , noogie . unh !
good work , tomu-san . tomorrow we work on the wedgie . now go .
brain : master hama ? yes ?
allow me to introduce myself . i am the brain .
i have come many miles with my small valet pinky
to study sumo at the camp of master hama .
your head is as small as a lychee nut ,
but your physique is excellent for sumo .
i would be honored to teach you .
actually , i am but an insignificant lab mouse
attempting to take over the world . the honor is all mine . [ clank ]
whaa ! whoa ! [ crash ]
there is no need for false humility and groveling . come .
we begin immediately . let us begin our first lesson .
excellent .
who do i flip first ? patience , brain-san .
when you are more advanced .
today , we consider the pebble .
consider the pebble ?
zen exercise to increase concentration .
observe the pebble 's simplicity . listen to its silence .
become the pebble . you want me to stare at a rock all day ?
just until lunchtime .
see you in 4 hours .
hama thinks i 'm a beginner , pinky . until he lets me compete
with advanced wrestlers , i 'll never get access to the mugu .
pinky ?
i was becoming one with the pebble .
were you ? yes .
and it 's really easy .
all you have to do is make your mind a complete blank .
too bad drawing a blank isn 't an olympic event , pinky .
we could retire on the gold medals you 'd win .
eat well , brain-san . we have much training left to do .
aren 't you hungry , master hama ? no .
i eat big lunch with my star wrestlers in other dining hall--
fried mugu , cajun mugu , mugu chowder , mojo mugu .
perhaps you will be allowed to eat mugu , too , eh ?
sooner than you think , my pan-pacific friend .
the sumo men must eat a lot to get so fat .
wrestlers not fat , pinky-san . it is muscle tissue
resulting from years of strenuous yoga exercises . [ door opens ] who wants pie ?
pinky , a day has passed , and we have nothing to show for it .
oh , i don 't know , brain . i 've developed a lovely relationship with our new friend the pebble .
pinky , have you ever contemplated the sound of one hand bopping ?
one hand , um ... don 't think so .
aah ! [ crowd chattering in distance ]
what 's going on ?
it is matsuhisa , the best wrestler in camp . he has had too much pie
and is taking on all challengers . grrr ! pinky : egad , brain .
to beat that matsu hoozy fellow .
pinky , are you pondering what i 'm pondering ?
i think so , brain ,
but who wants to see snow white and the seven samurai ?
no , pinky .
i will defeat the great matsuhisa , thereby proving that i am a great sumo wrestler .
matsuhisa , i will accept your challenge . what 's going on here ?
brain-san has gone completely insane . hmm , oh , that would explain
[ grunting ]
oof ! quit now , brain-san .
better to be live coward than dead idiot .
don 't worry , hama . it 's a matter of scientific fact
that i can flip any man up to 600 pounds . matsuhisa weighs 601 pounds .
noogie , noogie , noogie . ow !
stop hurting brain , you , you pie wrecker !
[ grunts ] whoa !
[ crash ]
[ boing ]
whaa !
[ grunts ]
kootchie kootchie .
[ laughing ] kootchie kootchie kootchie .
poit . kootchie kootchie koo . zort !
kootchie koo . kootchie poit !
[ crowd gasps ]
whaa ha ha ha ! whoa ho ho ho !
whoa ! whoa ! oof !
[ cheering ] the winner ! narf !
pinky : ooh , now we can get into the fancy restaurant , brain .
and we 'll get ahold of the fancy fish . this way , pinky .
this is it , pinky . the world 's only specimens of finnious japonicus
are in this tank . soon , kitchen freezers throughout the world will be stocked with cappy brain 's delicious mugu tails ,
you put the yum in yum-yum-yummy , cappy brain . zort !
[ both grunt ] tell me if you see any movement , pinky .
pinky : um , think i saw some movement just then , brain .
perhaps i should have researched the size of the mugu
a bit more thoroughly .
what do we do now , cappy brain ? hope the chef pushes the mugu , pinky ,
and plan for tomorrow night . why ?
what are we going to do tomorrow night , brain ? same thing we do every night , pinky--
dry off , and then
try to take over the world .

brain , voice-over : you may be wondering what a smart mouse like me is doing
floating face down in a large body of water .
well , you could say it 's all a result of the misguided attentions i paid to a certain member of the fairer sex .
pinky : poit ! you mean , you 're in the soup
yes , pinky , to use the vernacular .
i suppose i should start at the beginning .
the night began like any other .
i 'd hatched a scheme that was sure to take us straight to the top .
pinky , the key to global conquest sits right on the top of your head .
petroleum jelly ?
a little dab 'll do ya !
no , pinky .
neek . your hat .
behold the instrument of our conquest .
egad !
an amusement park for fleas .
no .
it 's the miniature prototype for my greatest stroke of genius , pinky .
the fedor-a-matic .
observe .
we shall divert the flow of the los angeles municipal water supply to a gigantic version of this mock-up .
ooh , a water park !
will it have slippery slides and bumper boats ?
will it , brain ? huh ?
look closer and see , pinky .
yes , the fedor-a-matic works like a dream !
i 'll say .
i feel all tingly in a good way .
oh ! you would .
but the more likely reaction will be panic and utter chaos .
with the populace trapped in their hats , we shall seize los angeles and then ...
pomona !
pomo--egad !
brilliant , brain .
oh , but no , no , wait .
what about people who don 't wear hats ?
there are no people who don 't wear hats .
it 's 1946 .
everyone wears hats all the time .
now , come , pinky .
we must travel to city hall and obtain the water rights for the fedor-a-matic from the council .
how , brain ?
are we going to bribe them with captain midnight secret decoder rings ?
no , pinky .
don 't be too sure i 'm as crooked as i 'm supposed to be .
besides , there 's no reason the city council shouldn 't look with favor upon the ambitions of a young lab mouse
brain , voice-over : it couldn 't fail .
but then she walked back into my life .
billie--a comely female specimen of consummate genetic design .
pinky : is that like a real swell dish with more curves than mulholland drive , brain ?
brain : yes , pinky .
[ refined , alluring voice ] hello , egghead .
billie , there 's something ...
different about you .
well , i 've been taking ... [ inhales ] breath control lessons .
[ gulp ] yes , so i see .
oh , pardon me . zort !
ha ha ! oh , this theater 's so dark , i can 't seem to find my seat .
[ unrefined , squawky voice ] ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! what a riot !
that 's funny , pink-- [ catching herself ] ooh .
i mean ... how whimsical . [ humming ]
if you 've just come to laugh ...
[ squawky ] i need help , eggie ,
so i came to you . natch .
[ refined ] i mean , naturally , i decided to seek your assistance .
how very flattering .
now , if you 'll excuse us , billie . we have important labors to attend to .
[ squawky ] you mean , taking over the world is more important than ... me ?
now , don 't get all malleable on me .
you always knew work came first .
yes . that 's why i left you for snowball .
don 't say that name .
you know what it does to me .
sorry , eggie . i forgot .
but if it 's any consolation , i 've left sno--him .
and now i need your help .
yes , well , if you 're in trouble , get yourself a gumshoe .
or at least a really sticky hat .
brain : i hated being tough on the old girl , but i was a mouse on a mission ,
brain : correction .
no one else was going to get in my way . billie :
aah ! help !
help , egghead !
help ! help !
pinky , it 's billie .
she really is in a pickle .
oh . dill or sweet ?
it 's all my fault .
why didn 't i help her ?
well , it might have something to do with the time she r-r-r-ripped out your fragile heart , then smashed it into millions of tiny little pieces .
yes . thank you , pinky .
yes , and then squ-u-u-i-i-ished them all up and ground them into pate .
i get the picture !
oh , and then she left you
for that gerbil-y fellow called--
snowball : snowball .
i told you never to say that name !
i didn 't say it , brain .
then who ... did ?
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! oh , i 'm sorry , brain . but i do so love it
when you wail pathetically . and now that billie is mine again , i suppose you 'll be doing nothing but wailing .
oh , i don 't think so .
brain gets terribly seasick .
you dirty ... hamster !
let billie go or i 'll--
heads .
tough luck , brain .
maybe you can try for 2 out of 3 .
brain , brain , brain .
you should know by now that no matter how many times we play the game , i always win .
well , i 'll give my regards to billie for you .
toodle-oo , old chump .
g 'bye , snowball .
be sure to call again soon !
don 't be shy ! drop by any ti--aah !
to coin a phrase ... ouch .
brain : billie needed me ,
so , putting my plans for world domination on hiatus , we hastened to the palatial abode of my nemesis .
pinky : you mean we hot-footed it to the hamster 's joint ?
brain : clam up , pinky .
the hamster lived in one of those $ 30,000 spanish-style medieval castles that everyone was so nuts about a few years back .
now , keep your eyes peeled for clues .
do they make a special utensil for that , brain ?
no , pinky , but i believe they do make a mouth clamp .
why don 't you use it ?
it 's billie , pinky !
we must make haste !
you mean , " get the lard out , chump " ? whaa !
brain : it can 't be !
pinky , the hamster has purloined our designs for the fedor-a-matic .
you know what that means ? oooh !
i 'll get another tight , tingly hat ?
no , pinky .
a slightly snug sombrero ?
no !
mildly uncomfortable lederhosen ?
not only has the hamster stolen billie , he wants to steal the world !
no !
[ grunting ] pinky ... help !
my hat is stuck .
always the lucky one , aren 't you ?
what happened to my hat ?
ahh ! look , brain !
a whole gaggle of hats .
pinky , where are you ?
this one 's rather rakish . hoo hoo .
brain ? where are you ?
how do i make it tight ?
oh , the irony of it all .
hoisted by my own fedor-a-matic .
brain ! the world !
the world can wai--oof !
there you are , brain .
bad for glass ! bad for glass !
bad for brain .
all my suffering was for naught , pinky .
we don 't have a single clue to follow .
does that mean this grocery list i found in my hat isn 't a clue ?
" things to do . "
[ reading ]
" bribe city council " ?
-type theme ] pinky : this is the city-- um ...
i mean , this is the city hall !
but you can 't sell off the water rights .
i need water for my arugula !
and i need water for my kombucha mushroom plantation .
i need water for my mr. wiggly-woggly hosey thingy dingy dere !
sorry , but the water rights have already been awarded .
meeting is adjourned .
jiminy ! i always wanted a captain midnight decoder ring !
i 'll say ! this is swell !
pinky , are you pondering what i 'm pondering ?
i think so , brain , but if we get sam spayed ,
we 'll never have any puppies .
no , pinky .
someone has already bribed the council for the water rights .
you mean ...
don 't say it , pinky .
wee willie winkie ?
no , pinky .
snowball :
too late again , brain .
pppbbbbllttt !
after him , pinky !
i need water for my elephants ! ow !
we 're in luck !
taxi !
tax--eeegh !
follow that car !
yes ! this is a pain that is most promising .
egad ! it 's astounding , brain .
that i am pliant enough to survive such calamity ?
nooo ! that you actually found a cab in l.a. natch !
brain :
we got to the reservoir without a moment to lose . pinky :
and there were 3 bowls of porridge .
and i said , " my , grandma .
what big , swollen ankles you have . "
brain : stow it , pinky .
come on , pinky .
it 's not as hard as it looks . argh !
you just get a little-- [ ripping ] yaah ! scraped up , that 's-- [ ripping ]
pinky !
pinky , hurry up !
right here , brain . natch !
oh , well , sure !
you can take the easy way !
man with polish accent : hold it right there , mousey mouse .
you 're a very nosy fella , mousey mouse .
you know what happens to nosy fellas , hmm ?
huh ? do you ? hmm ?
this !
gee , i never think to carry an umbrella in los angeles . gaaah !
egad !
i 'll save you , brain !
um , brain , before i save you , do you think you could teach me to swim ?
with all that air in your head , it 's a wonder you don 't float .
whoo-hoo ! that was almost as thrilling as our swirling whirlpool of fun
you 've been playing in the toilet again , haven 't you , pinky ?
well , if you want to get technical ...
no ! it can 't be !
pinky , we 're too late .
the fedor-a-matic has been built !
ooh , joy !
tight hat city , here we come !
top of the world , brain .
care to tip your hat to my accomplishment while you still can ? ha ha ha ha ha !
after him , pinky .
he 's about to engage the machine .
poit ! i didn 't even know they were going steady .
we really ought to bring a gift , brain--hwack !
you know where they 're registered ?
congratulations , snowball !
we 're so happy for you and your fiancee !
a hamster engaged to a big machine ?
what will people say ?
brain : stop being foolish , pinky .
oh , you 're right , brain .
as long as they 're happy .
we should get them something nice .
a fondue set , maybe . i mean , after all , we are getting tight hats in the bargain .
i 'll stop you now .
no !
it can 't be !
egad , brain !
snowball 's turned into a mouse !
no , pinky . it 's billie .
billie 's turned into a hamster ?
nyeh ! she 's a mouse !
she 's a hamster !
she 's a mouse !
she 's a hamster !
she 's a mouse and a hamster ? [ sobbing ]
yes , eggie , it is i .
but ... but why ?
snowball : because she loves me .
yes , brain , it was all a ruse ,
designed to distract you long enough for us to steal your plans and execute them .
and execute me in the process .
don 't be silly , brain .
it would take all the fun out of life .
i derive my greatest pleasure from making you squirm .
i derive my greatest pleasure from making brain squirt milk out of his nose . natch !
ha ha ha ha ! billie : stop that !
snowball wasn 't trying to get rid of you , egghead . i was !
what ?
i 'm sorry , eggie , but as long as you 're in the picture , i 'll never really have the thing i want most .
the world ?
no .
me .
guess again .
what ?
put me down , you goon .
sorry , snowy .
i was just using you to get the water rights .
besides , you never could accept me for what i am , making me take voice lessons and all .
and you , eggie , you love the world too much to ever really care about me .
sorry , but neither of you will ever hold a candle to my one true love .
pinky ...
pinky ? !
pinky ? ! i 've been played like a tuneless fiddle at a hoedown .
care to do the hokey-pokey ?
pinky , i built this for you .
i hope ya like it .
egad ! my own fedor-a-matic ?
no , my darling !
a giant water park ! with slippery slides and bumper boats !
oooh , brain ! can we ride the bumper boats ?
can we ?
can we , plee-ee-ee-ease ?
you don 't need brain 's permission , pinky .
i don 't ? no !
your days of being bopped on the head
and kowtowing to brain 's every whim are over !
they are ? yes !
boys ?
gee , that looks like kicks , goony-goon .
alone at last !
ha ha ha ha ! oh , you 're not alone , billie .
i 'm here !
and now i can give you the greatest gift of all .
a hat squished down all tingly-wingly around my head ?
no , silly !
me !
well ... what do ya think ?
you want to take over my world , big boy ?
um , er , uh , uh ,
i--i--i--i--i-- i 'll have to ask brain if it 's ok .
he was some kind of a mouse .
hey , dad , what 's that ?
the world 's first water park .
it sure looks swell .
what are we waiting for ?
brain , voice-over : well , this is where you came in-- with me in the drink like somebody 's dirty laundry .
pinky , voice-over : ooh ! i hope they separated the undergarments .
come , pinky .
we must towel off and prepare for tomorrow night .
gee , brain , what are we going to do tomorrow night ,
construct a machine to make our pants really tight ?
no , pinky .
the same thing we do every night--
try to take over the world !
snowball : if i don 't beat you to it .
get your hand off of me , you damp , hairy hamster !
as you wish .
* they 're dinky , they 're pinky *
* and the brain , brain , brain , brain , brain *

- corbeii , we have a problem
- help me !

- what we 've been seeing on tv , logically , must have come from the mind of blanche von trieck
- except that she 's dead

those guys are scattered all over the world
except lefiaguais who 's dead
a signal

no , no , no !

the tv again ?

she gave me another clue :
" the last victim will act as a compass "
- that 's all fine and dandy lapointe but i 've got documents in the car
- did you read them ?
- no , i 'm going to right now
- shit , biron !
do you have a record ?
- what ?
- a criminal record ? - why ?
- fingerprints !
- never mind
- i didn 't know a little " home-made " alcohol in the bottles would make them sick
if they didn 't drink so much in the first place
now two of them have stomach cancer but it 's not my fault
- hold on buddy :
i think some of them have two words for you - come on guys , you know me better than that
i never did that
well , well , look who we have here

i 've changed and i 'ii change again , ok ?
and what the old woman said isn 't true
i didn 't betray you by working with your father
i betrayed myself

stephanie , open the door
you want to know something ?

that big dumb-ass
- this isn 't right , it isn 't right
- who fired ?
- who 's with you ?
- i 'm with mom
- suzanne !
- almost over almost over
- i 'd take money in my register every time

i 'm sorry about what happened to blanche and your wife
- blanche said you 'd come and talk to me about this
- i thought blanche 's stories
- some days i manage not to believe them
- want some ?
- you lost your wife too , eh ?
- yeah
- so , what was it you wanted to tell me ?
- i don 't really know
i thought maybe you could help me with my investigation or to understand why blanche chose me , why i 'm here
forget it
- look , bianche would probably tell you that the answer is right before your eyes
- thanks
as far as compass goes , doesn 't get any better
- i had to come
- that 's ok , i 'm glad you 're here
- i 'm sorry about this afternoon
- i don 't want you to explain , catherine
you asked me before if i believe it 's possible to start over
well now , with you , i think i couid
- what 's going on ?
- the whole town is blabbing on tv
one scandal after another
they take turns beating on each other
nothing very interesting
- hey , moron
that 's you on tv
- we 're real good friends
- i 'm exhausted
- why don 't i escort you to your bed ?
- no , with you , i forget everything ;
i don 't feel as tired

- not my place , not now
- it 's " badaboom " mrs
badaboom was more than his dog
i
i didn 't see him
i ran him over
- badaboom ?
that was you , moron ?
- yes
- badaboom ?
but why didn 't you tell me ?
- i couldn 't , i felt so bad
- come here
forget about it
badaboom would have wanted it that way
- yeah , ok
- those documents don 't exist anymore , eh , beiiveau ?
- i kept them - i know why you kept them because you 're afraid of me
a real female
i misjudged you
i 'm willing to bet that journalist had something to do with this
- lapointe ?
no , he - not lapointe
biron lapointe wouldn 't have left prints all over the place
check if they match biron 's file and we have to find him right now
send someone to the hydroplanes
there 's only one road leading out of great bear , right ?
- olson road to the forty-four about a hundred miles in the woods
- i 'ii put up a roadblock
if this gets out , do you realize how much shit we 'ii be in because of you ?
they 'ii be looking for a scapegoat and i 'm not going down alone ,
- yes sir
i 'ii be there as soon as i can
yes
if i 'm there tomorrow , i 'ii be on lapointe 's tv show
this is big simone , bigger than the lambert case ;
- it 's your turn emiie
what the lambert case did for lapointe 's career , this scoop will do for yours , honey
- but
lapointe ; do you really think
- you think he would have shared the spotlight on a case like this ?
- don 't rely on appearances
lapointe is a bit harsh sometimes but deep down he 's a good guy
- emile , without that scoop , his career is over
- that 's why it wouid be a rotten thing to
- he might be a good guy but he 'ii take all the credit because he can 't afford not to
don 't you get it ?
they sent him to great bear to get rid of him , he said so himself
- i don 't know
- emile
you 're just a pawn to him
what do you think 's gonna happen if you show up there together ?
it 'ii be : " hello lapointe !
leave your shadow in the coatroom "
- hey
i led the investigation into the iumberjacks
that 's my doing
- that 's all i 'm saying , kitten
it 's your turn
- it 's about time i got out of here
- biron
biron ?
he probably thought this would be the first place the cops would come looking for him
the key is at the front desk
- coast is clear , they 're gone
- you 're booking me ?
- hurry up , he can 't be far
- what 's the motive ?
- we 'ii deal with it at the station
- they must have the hydroplanes under surveillance
i can 't take the road
- i have an idea
- did you find him ? - no
- i want my lawyer !
- miss , i apologize for the brief delay , but be assured that
i want my lawyer !
- what lawyer ?
- hello what ?
- did you see what 's on tv ?
- i don 't watch tv anymore
- i 'm sure it wouid cheer you up
- there 's only one thing that would cheer me up
- does this make my ass look fat ?
- hello ?
hi gastonne , how are you doing ?
- how am " i " doing ?
well
we emptied the place and filled up the hospital
where are you ?
- somewhere safe
- what did you find ?
is my father involved ?
be honest
- no
- no ?
- i mean i didn 't find anything compromising on anybody
i don 't think i took the right documents
- shit !
- i know
- it 's still breaking and entering
- i can 't talk to you
the cops are here
- ok , don 't move emiie
- i can 't do this
- come on emiie , it 'ii grow back
- but my pride won 't
- what does that mean ?
- look at me
i just lied to my best friend
i 'm betraying lapointe i 'm lying to my childhood idol for god 's sake !
- emile , don 't start this again
- i won 't start again
i swear i won 't start again
- kitten
- heiene
we found him
- my husband ?
- he 's in the hospital
get dressed , i 'ii
biron
- hey !
this is georges ferron !
hurry up and find him a room he paid for this hospital
- it 's all right christian
it wasn 't a heart attack , just a little warning
- a heart attack ?
you told me
- it 's nothing ; she just told you
- but dad
- make a man of yourself !
- yeah , yeah
- how 's our business going ?
- dove will be here this morning , with the money
she 's already taken a liking to me
we 'ii do it in broad daylight
she 'ii be a friend of mine visiting
we make the trade , no hassle ;
she sleeps at the hotel , no worries
- did you think of that yourself ?
- sure did !
i even arranged a surprise reunion with an old friend of hers
- what did i tell you about armand ?
he 's not worth
- not worth it ?
armand 's share is twenty thousand bucks !
- what do you do if she shoots him in the middle of the street ?
- no , she doesn 't suspect a thing
got her wrapped around my little finger
guaranteed
armand !
armand !
open up
hold me
- how 's it going ?
we can do this another day if you want ; i 'm in no hurry
- if you made me come over here to see me abandoned and miserable ; go ahead , take a good look
- no is an unexpected pleasure
- what are you doing here if you haven 't done anything ?
- you have no scruples getting murderers off , but the innocent
- if you have to whip me some more
i told you , i 'm sorry about your wife , and i regret getting the guy off
- aii right , all right
i believe you
- what ?
- i forgive you
- you say that because the bars keep you from strangling me ?
i 'm not doing it for you ;
if you only knew how much better i feel , not hating you
- i can believe that
ok
- actually , they don 't want me ; it 's biron they 're after
- biron ?
why ?
- they think he 's got compromising documents
- compromising for who ?
- for national security why , i don 't know yet but it has to do with the helicopter accident that killed the iumberjacks ten years ago
- that ugly statue in front ?
- yeah , that 's it in fact , they have no intentions of letting me go until they have biron and the documents
- ok , so what am i doing here ?
- you play along but
while they were interrogating me , i overheard some info :
listen at ten o 'ciock sharp
- wouidn 't it be better to tell them to send backup ?
- if they learn what 's going on , not only do i lose the case i 've dedicated my iife to , but you 'ii lose your eyes , ears and what 's left of your balls ; in that order
in eight seconds
special agent corbeii , colonel
edouard paquette and robert beiiveau are also present
i 'm fully aware this is a delicate case , but i have the situation under control
paquette and beiiveau can testify to it
- yes
- blanche von trieck 's murderer is someone who has a high caliber scientific formation and who has been in contact with professor paquette 's research
he succeeded in reproducing and improving the technology developed by paquette
he was able to make a copy of his victim 's brain
avirtuai copy
- a copy of her brain - that 's what they said but i don 't have all the details
- glad to run into you
- i have to be somewhere but i 'ii be back later
but i 'm warning you biron ;
i 'm leaving great bear tomorrow
- come on armand
lapointe - lapointe , follow the constable : you 're free to go
- come on lapointe
- don 't worry biron , we 'ii get you out of here
- well , i sure hope so !
gastonne , gastonne you can 't leave me here
- that 's not so bad , all they have on you is driving under the influence
you 'ii end up with three months and community service , maximum
- no , gastonne i lied to you
i did read the documents
they 'ii want to kill me , i swear !
they already have killed a dozen others ;
- what were those papers ?
- your friend biron didn 't tell you ?
- he didn 't read them
anyway , i want to hear it from you
what happened to the iumberjacks ?
of course : you never trusted me
you 're not about to start today
- you want me to trust you but - yes
- can you keep a secret ?
it wasn 't supposed to be that way
they asked me for twelve guys , preferably unemployed , with no wives , no kids
- no future
- i ran an ad :
" dangerous job , lots of quick money "
i knew exactly who would show up
before they got on the helicopter ,
corbeii offered them five times their pay if they agreed to participate in an experiment
they all signed up
sam first
after a few days , i went up to see what was going on
the guys had lost their minds
when i got a hold of sam
come on !
come on sam !
sam , sam , listen listen sam
you have to get out of here while you still got cells !
- still got cells
- go on !
then they arranged for the accident
- and you didn 't say anything
- no !
are you insane ?
you have to help me gastonne
do this for your father
if all this gets out
- " still got cells " ;
that 's the sentence which got us started on the right track
- yes , i know
i liked sam
you see where feelings get you ?
you always say i have a heart of stone
but i got sam out ; that proves
please , don 't make me regret the only time i followed my heart
- you already regret it
you can 't turn your father in
help me
you 're a cop dad
you 're supposed to protect people
- you 're the only person i can count on
- you say i 'm not a good cop
take a look at yourself
- they 'ii lock me up for the rest of my iife for a mistake that , even if i wanted to , i can 't fix
- i 'ii think about it
- thanks
listen and the bar are yours but
- relax dove
i have a surprise you 're gonna like
- oh yeah ?
- there you are !
give me my money and then : adios
dove ?
- hello armand
- surprise !
- christian
- give me my bag - do what you want with him , but not here , ok ?
- i said give me my bag , now !
armand !
we can finally settle this
look at me !
- please
- here
this is all i wrote you since
half are love letters , half are death threats :
they 're for you
- why ?
- because it took a iong time but
i want nothing to do with you
nothing with your love , nothing with your death
they 're yours
- you knew i was here ?
- you 're the only one who called me dove
- dove , you know
- kiss me
kiss me one last time , then goodbye
- goodbye
- stef , put that down
- who is she ?
- this is dove : my ex
- that 's right , i am his ex
- i 'm sure it 's true
funny how easy it is to get the truth when you 're holding this eh ?
funny
i should have tried this before eh ?
i would have known a iot faster that you led mom to her death
- who told you
you know i didn 't want to hurt her
i just wanted her to know
- don 't swear in front of me
- i would have told you but dad
- what you told me was that you don 't ever want me to try to help you
count on me
i don 't think there 's anything left for me to know , right ?
unless there 's something else you 're hiding , eh armand ?
- careful
- i wasn 't talking to you
she seems to know what she 's talking about eh ?
is that what excites you ?
a chick with a gun ?
am i turning you on , armand ?
- stef
- what are you waiting for ?
don 't you see she 's crazy about you ?
- not loaded ?
you know , i really do like you
- so , are you going to show me your big - that 's right , i am his ex .
- here , didn 't you ordered this ?
- yes
- i haven 't felt like this in so long

hunting season hasn 't started and i hate wild game
- hunting is good for the nerves
- i 'ii calm down when the deal 's done and when armand is
- never mind armand stephanie doesn 't want him anymore ; he has nothing left here he 'ii leave on his own
- i don 't understand why we should give him his share
- because you don 't rob a guy from the iast thing he 's got
you of all people should know that
- aside from that , i have a problem with catherine
- be patient with her
there are a iot of things you don 't know about her
i asked her to marry me
- huh ?
- you heard me
- you asked her
and what did she answer ?
- i iove her and don 't take me wrong but i iove her more than i ever loved your mother
that journalist is cozying up to her
he 'ii get out of the way , trust me
- is that why we 're here , so you could tell me this ?
- what ? afather and his son can 't hunt together without
i just want you to know that sometimes , you have to feel like you 're losing things to really appreciate them
give me your shades
the sun 's in my face
- here dad
are you all right dad ?
- yes , yes , i 'm all right
- i got it
- you got it dad let 's go get it
- thanks for the flowers , last night
and the note
- you weren 't home
- i was there
- i 'm going a little too fast , is that it ?
- georges , my sister 's husband , thinks that once you know me better , you 'ii dump me
- isn 't he a little biased ?
- still , he 's probably right
- do you really think this is a sex game ?
honestly catherine ;
i 'm not twenty years old anymore
although i might appear to be
- there 's no age for chasing skirts
but that 's not the point
- oh , by the way i 'd rather you wouldn 't be at the gala , tonight
i 'm about to do something that i wouldn 't want you to see
- and i 'm about to show you something i never thought i couid show
- catherine , what 's wrong ?
i don 't know what you want to show me but can it wait ?
- i won 't have the courage twice
- go away , go away
- catherine calm down
- please , please
- ok , i 'ii leave
fights , special attractions and the participation of a surprise celebrity
attention , everyone
- i 'm fed up , man
we should have recorded it
- now you think of that ! damn idiot !
- why don 't you shut up ?
- when will you learn to mind your own business ?
- what is heiene doing in the interrogation room , have you seen what state she 's in ?
- she appeared on tv , iike the other three , we 're looking for a connection
- in the mean time , what do we do about marcoux ?
it 's been three days since he disappeared
- i won 't send out a search party every time a cheated husband slams the door
- but dad , it 's marcoux
- i 'ii tell you one last time gastonne ;
you take things too personal
if you want to become any good at this job
- you think i 'm no-good too ?
- what you need to be a cop is a cool head , common sense and a gun
you 're my daughter but all you 've got is the gun
monette ?
monette it 's me
say , do you know wrestling ?
what the hell is a " death hammer " ?
- so , how are things going ?
any headway ? - i 've wasted my time
they have no idea why they appeared on tv and they have nothing in common
aside from the weirdo and the nymphomaniac , they barely know each other
the boxer is a retard
the bi-gendered hairdresser is completely insane
the woman only talked about her husband who left her
and the kid wasn 't saying anything
- what have you learned since you 've been here ?
- what is blocking the tv signal is a magnetic field
- yes but we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmitting from
the antenna on the mountain ?
- i checked
to locate the source , we would need to intercept the signal
this means climbing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmitting at that moment
- i 've already called georges ferron to go with you
beiiveau and i , we have to prepare a first report , and we have nothing to give them
so if you find anything new
hello ?
- hello my handsome christian
it 's dove
- hello babe !
i was just thinking about you
- well , well
- about you
- i was calling to tell you i 'ii be arriving tomorrow ,
i 'ii be alone
- tomorrow ?
tomorrow 's fine
alone ?
you 're brave
- i decided to trust you christian
- you shouldn 't
- i 'ii be a friend of yours visiting from montreal
we 'ii do this in broad daylight
real smooth
- you know
i really do like you
- thanks , i forgot it
i can 't be without that clip
step right up ladies and gentlemen !
an evening filled with excitement awaits you
come in and see spectacular fights
we have wrestling , we have boxing we have plenty of tv 's so you won 't miss anything if someone else appears
step right up !
- it 's up to you
- hey !
there 's a girl here !
- she 's not a girl , she 's a cop
- careful , her boyfriend is a hairdresser
- you mean her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- you can 't leave tonight pierre
- i 'ii take a plane tomorrow :
that will be one less freak in great bear
- at least tell me what you saw in blanche 's book
- it isn 't blanche 's book
- will you just explain then ?
- you looked
you 'ii pay the price , great bear will pay
go away
- tell me who blanche 's heiress is
why didn 't her powers get passed on ?
- you 'ii know nothing
- i feel that blanche 's soul is trapped
help me free her
pierre , help me help blanche
- you don 't understand
- no , i don 't understand
pierre ?
- her girlfriend is a hairdresser
- here
- thanks
- don 't let it get to you
they 're all afraid they are freaks too , on the inside
they all are a little , and they know it
it soothes them to see people who are on the outside
- when blanche was here , we could just go see her
- hey , it 's starting !
ladies and gentlemen !
welcome to
- in the spotlight , idiot
- welcome to the von trieck hangar , site of the most incredible entertainment
- this better be worth it , bianche , or you 'ii hear from me in the great beyond
- and now ladies and gentlemen , the first fight of the evening will oppose : in the blue corner ,
" bobby the mayor " beiiveau
and in the red corner , " luigi big star " lapointe
that wasn 't in the script
- hey , i just had a concussion here
- people are supposed to root for me
- be careful
put everything exactly back where you got it
if he notices anything , we 're done for
- will we have time ?
- yes , maryse is alone here until six o 'ciock
- you think pierre will be able to ?
- he read the book , he had visions
if anyone is capable of saving blanche 's soul , he is
we must do it before he leaves
- how many fingers ?
- everyone remembers the words ?
- hey , can you see my finger ?
- he 's knocked out
- move away
- no , no , no !
- where are we at ?
- " death hammer "
- mrs
why didn 't you tell me ?
- pierre , help me !
help me !
- blanche ?
you were right
" where the thief dances "
- i didn 't know what the sentence meant when i wrote it
- but you were right
- if you want but now i 'm here to tell you i was wrong
- tell me everything
who killed you , who killed dr the tv , the book
- you 're the one who must answer those questions
aii i can tell you now is this :
i 've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes her discoveries
i have also told you that most of us want to do good , not evil
unfortunately , every thirteenth generation , there is an evil witch
she writes the thirteenth chapter , a bloody chapter , full of maiedictions
- mom ! stop !
stop , she can 't take it anymore !
- for thirty years , i wrote the twelfth chapter of my book
i couldn 't accept that when i died i would have to give my powers to an evil one
so i decided to change the course of things and to skip the thirteenth chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
i chose my son 's wife
she accepted to submit herself to a iong and hard treatment
she fought alone against a thousand demons
i pushed her to the end , in the hopes to save a generation against forces of evil
- leave diane alone , is that clear ?
- i failed
thomas lost his wife
sarah lost her mother
the whole town lost a friend
one last thing
the last victim will serve as a compass
- the last victim will serve as a compass
thanks pierre
now listen
- apparently there are a iot of bears in the area
- yeah
a iot
- november 5th , vote beiiveau
- and now , the moment you have been waiting for ;
the fight opposing , in the red corner , the former canadian champion , medium weight :
jean-guy poitras
and in the blue corner
you ! - dad !
dad you can 't let that happen
he doesn 't have a permit for this
- come on , can you see me trying to take away their show ?
they already hold me responsible for the tv
- dad , you can 't , you can 't !
- leave me alone
- ok , you 're right
good night - calling me a fag , huh ?
very brave when you 're twelve against one with baseball bats , but face to face
come on you cowards , i have one hand tied behind my back
come on , big guy , iet 's go !
- you put everything back exactly in its place ?
- yes perfectly
- we have a volunteer ladies and gentlemen :
rick cyr
- aii right !
hey
- thanks biron
corbeii , we have a problem
- what do we do now ?
- we wait
hoping that the madman who transmits on great bear 's waves sends another episode
- the madman might be just a joker
- trust me
to do what he does , one must be deranged
- and you designed the device ?
you experimented on humans ?
- i was doing research on mental imagery
corbeii 's the one who pushed me
- she stroked my ego
i was going to make history
national security offered me a laboratory , volunteer test subjects
i fell for it
- quit whining
do you know what 's going on ?
- someone pushed my research further
i was able to read the nerve influx of the rats to project images
but i was never able to search their memories
i never had the intention to broadcast
- so the rabbits on tv
- they must have been test subjects
- but what we 've been seeing on tv that doesn 't come from the mind of a rabbit
what we 've been seeing on tv , logically , must have come from the mind of blanche von trieck
except that she 's dead
- i don 't know exactly how but just before her death , the madman was able make an electronic copy of her brain
it 's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- that guy isn 't a madman , he 's a genius
- yeah , a genius ! who has already killed at ieast two people :
von trieck and dr
- how many have you killed ?
- i never killed anybody , i stopped
they wanted me to continue but i refused
- but still , you must have an idea of who might be doing this ?
- it has to be someone who knows my research
those guys are scattered all over the world
except lefiaguais who 's dead
- lefiaguais ?
- a signal
we 'ii locate the transmitter
- lefiaguais ?
no ! no !
- so
you got to grande ourse two days ago
- you 're sending me to a hole
- out of the blue , you ended up at blanche von trieck 's
- i was waiting for you
- then you took a night stroll with the old woman
- i don 't know the meaning of these sentences but i know they will help you , one by one , to save my soul
- and mine
it 's been a iong time since i 've seen such a beautiful women
i thought the clues were leading me to a criminal
- the last victim will act as a compass
- in reality , they were leading me to you
- lapointe ?
bianche 's killer it 's catherine
lapointe ?
lapointe ! it 's catherine !
it 's catherine , lapointe
catherine open the door !
i know you 're there
- georges
- no catherine !
- catherine !
- get in i have to talk to you
i know
- no , i know
- stephanie
stef
- soon it won 't hurt anymore , you 'ii see
- yes , i need an ambulance at the la forge hotel , room number two
it looks like a heart attack , hurry up
they 're on their way georges
- catherine is not a woman for you
you don 't know her
you don 't know anything about her
- forget about that ok ?
don 't think about that
- listen
she 's the one i ioved
she was 15 , i was 24
i was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off suzanne first , her older sister
it was catherine 's idea ,
i swear
catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
but don 't think she didn 't love her sister
she adored her
it was for her she did all this
suzanne was deranged , almost always off in her own world
she would have ended up alone , unhappy
catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
it went wrong when catherine got pregnant
she cried for weeks , but to protect her sister , she decided to have an abortion
in those days , thomas von trieck 's wife was blanche 's apprentice except that she was using what the learned from blanche to do black magic
catherine went to see her
but the abortion didn 't work
she went off to montreal to have the baby
he was born a vegetable and a gimp
she never forgave herself
she hid him
and she became obsessed she dedicated her life to finding a way to cure our son
she never succeeded
she 's only been back in great bear for two , three years
i thought things were better
- georges where can i find her ?
- you won 't find her
- lefiaguais 's bimbo is here
- yes , that 's it
it looks like catherine , ferron 's sister-in-iaw
- and his mistress
- yes , exactly
- ferron i knew he did it on purpose
- paquette , couldn 't you have thought of that ?
- lefiaguais 's girlfriend ? she couldn 't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amoeba
at least she didn 't look like it
- beiiveau ?
- yes ?
- not you , your daughter
very good work , beiiveau
i will personally see that your efforts be rewarded by a promotion
- thanks
- this is a very serious case
you saw what happened in great bear , on a small scale ?
if the discoveries of what 's her name ?
- catherine lapiante
- if lapiante 's discoveries were found out , if they ended up in the wrong hands
do you understand ? - yes
- we have to act quickly so that despite a few errors committed in the past , the information concerning this case remains secret
- that i can 't
- sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the lesser of two evils
in this case , it 's better to leave the deaths of a few iumberjacks unpunished than to risk that dangerous technologies end up in the hands of terrorists , or
- got it !
i found the coordinates of the transmitter that broadcasted those images last night
- forget what you know about the iumberjacks
it won 't bring them back ;
it 's all in the past we need you , right now
- you won 't regret it , captain beiiveau
- chief , someone stole a body from the morgue
- who 's body ?
- blanche
a bunch of people took her
they 're freaking out because of the tv they want to bury her
- come on !
- beiiveau , i want my lawyer !
i want my lawyer !
i want my lawyer
- buy us some time
let him see armand but no one else
- catherine ?
- what are you doing here ?
- i was looking for stephanie
she got in the car with catherine and i can 't find her
what 's this ?
- catherine it can 't be true
- what ? - biron is in danger , your stephanie too
- what do you mean , in danger ?
- come on , i 'ii explain on the way
- he 's my stepbrother ?
- genetically , achilles is even closer to you since i 'm your mother 's sister
but there isn 't a name for that , except " bastard "
- when i found out you 're the one who killed mom , i wanted to kill you catherine , i swear
but now
- revenge doesn 't make the pain go away
only forgiveness can
but people are too weak to forgive
you 'ii feel so much better after
- so , now it 's party time
- i 'ii sleep here tonight
take me out for dinner and
- right
- the images that appeared last night were broadcasted from here
- that 's close to the old mine
- i 'ii take a gps , i 'ii manage
but make sure your daughter stays on our side until biron has his accident
after that she won 't be able to do anything
this might be a very important day , boys !
- what do you think she 'ii do once she can search anybody 's brain ?
- she 'ii spread joy all around the world
- chief !
chief !
- what ? what is it ?
- it 's biron
he hung himself in his cell
oh no !
help !
somebody ! hurry !
open the door ! unlock the door !
oh my god !
ok , i got him go call an ambulance , quick !
- hold on , hold on
- i 'm proud of you son
you handled it like a pro
i can go in peace now
- c 'mon dad
- christian , all i have is yours now
but take care of your sister
- don 't say that dad , our business has just started
we 'ii get more wads like these , you 'ii see
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing
- no , i know there 's something , what is it dad ?
- it 's ok son , it 's experience
- what ?
- counterfeit
- that two-timing little tramp !
- calm down christian
- well , thanks guys
- i 've had this harness since i played the hanging of louis-riei in a college play and now ; an escape
- well , it wasn 't aicatraz , but still
- so now we have to go to the morgue , we have to find stephanie
- the morgue ?
- yes , because the real " last victim " was dr mondoux
there 's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to stef - so , he knows everything now ?
- you 're the one who wanted to split
- yeah but still not two days ago he was " that little brat " and now - get out
- no problem
- the only reason i got you out of there was because i thought your life was in danger because of what you read on the iumberjacks - i didn 't read anything
- hey !
don 't give me that shit
when they got a hold of you , you were fleeing to montreal with the scoop
- yeah
- don 't worry biron , at your age , in those circumstances ,
i would have done the same
- really ?
- but what hurts me is that you didn 't tell me face to face
- i i know
- yeah
- now , don 't tell me you didn 't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or i i 'ii never speak to you again
i really wouldn 't have taught you anything
- well
i took some digital pictures
i have them all right here , on mini-disc
- that 's my biron !
ok , now you can go
- go where ?
- to montreal
- no , i can 't go alone ; you have to come with me
- no , your time has come
you wanted your chance : you got it
- no , no , i couldn 't
- listen ,
i came here to save my soul , not my career
remember ?
- yeah , right
- look , saint-denis will pick you up in half an hour at the crooked lake , ok ?
one last thing
listen , a iong story but
catherine killed blanche and the doctor
- what ?
no
didn 't i tell you not to trust her ?
you really liked her didn 't you ?
i 'm really sorry
- take care of yourself
- yeah , thanks for everything
- what do you mean , the morgue is closed ? - they 've already stolen a body
- who 's ?
- blanche 's
they 're gone to bury or cremate her
they 're the only ones left
- it 's dr mondoux we want to see
- impossible
- the last victim wait !
look these are the marks from paquette and catherine 's device he 's the iast victim
but what does it mean , " the last victim will act as a compass " ?
- armand , if i 've learned one thing here it 's that sometimes
" the last victim will act as a compass " simply means the iast victim will act as a compass
- are you sure ?
- do you have another way to find catherine and stephanie ?
- i 'm telling you , they took the body into the woods
what do we tell her family ? what ?
what ?
i don 't understand ;
let me talk to him
hi , dad ? yes
what do you mean escaped ? - escaped !
he 's gone
i have all the roads under surveillance , the hydroplanes too
he won 't go far but he can talk
- he wants his scoop he won 't talk
except that there 's more than one lake in the area
- i don 't have enough staff to check all the lakes
- saint-denis
- what about saint-denis ?
- he 's coming down
he 's going to crooked lake
- crooked lake
easy , easy
easy
- don 't move biron !
stay here !
- you 'ii take me in
you 'ii send me to my death ? - i have orders you can 't leave great bear
- orders from who ?
your father ?
corbeii ? they 're in it up to here , gastonne
- this is a national security matter
- no , no , this is an anal security matter
those two want to save their asses and you know it
- you 're only thinking of your scoop , you 're not seeing the consequences
- yes , i 'm thinking of my scoop
and the consequences will be the truth will come out and justice will be done
- don 't make me laugh ! there always will be injustice biron
don 't you see ?
it won 't do any good to play don quichotte
stay here - there 's a windmill awaiting me
i know you don 't believe what you say
you 'd iike to save your father but it 's too late
he did what he did
you 'ii have to live with the choices you 're making today as well
- come back
- think about it gastonne
we never will be
but i 've known you for twenty-five years
if there 's one thing i know , it 's that we 'ii never be on the side of the liars and cheaters
you might doubt that today
i still doubted it yesterday
but i iook at myself today , i iook at you and i 'm sure of it
- biron , don 't do this
biron , come back !
biron , i iove you !
i iove you !
i 'm sorry dad
- you shouldn 't be
- my friends
before blanche can join the spirits of the forest , i have to tell you something
- catherine
please !
i forgive you
i don 't want to lose my memories
- poor little girl , you 're scared
but you 'ii feel so much better after
i 'ii only remove the bad ones
you know , at first , i did all this for achilles
with neurology , i was trying to find a way to talk to him to tell him that if i couid start over
but i can 't
so i wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
i didn 't want blanche to die i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
don 't you think ?
- stef ?
- catherine , no
catherine , please
it 's over now , iet me help you
- i can go in peace now
aii i have is yours
- don 't do anything stupid christian ,
look at it as a game
you lost this one , you 'ii win others
- no , no
i can lose them all but not this one
- you 've already all read blanche 's book
- yes
- blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation , the thirteenth chapter , the evil one , so she could pass on her powers to someone good
but she failed
that 's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exists
it will always exist
we have to keep fighting it , all the time , whether it 's inside or outside of ourselves
- ok , but
who would be the thirteenth ?
the bad one ?
- yeah , who 's the heiress of blanche 's powers ?
- for me , there 's no doubt
she 's the thirteenth
sarah von trieck
- don 't you think you 've done enough , pierre ?
first , you disrespect my mother 's body , and now , her granddaughter
this little girl is grieving so much since her grandmother died that she hasn 't said a word
and you want to make her out to be a demon ?
- she 's the one i tell you
i 'm sure , she 's the one
didn 't you hear that ?
she said she wants to kill me !
didn 't you hear ?
- that 's enough pierre go have yourself examined
leave us alone
- you don 't believe me , you 'ii regret it
you 'ii all regret it
- you want to burn her right here ?
- yes
- let 's finish this
- it 's over now
let me help you
- go
you
stay here
- you were hiding a iot of things from me
- i never hid that i hid things
- true
- that i was a monster ?
- no , that 's not it
- admit it , i am a monster in your eyes now , iike in my own
- no , no , no catherine , no
- the look in your eyes was the only hope i had left
- the look in your eyes was what saved me
thanks to you catherine , i 've changed
- sit down
please
- are you all right ?
- do you still love me , in spite of everything ?
- yes , in spite of everything , in spite of my own will sometimes
come on , we 've got to get help
- would you forgive me ?
- i can tell you 're going to break my heart
that , i 'm warning you , i won 't forgive you for
- it 's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- is this a challenge or a warning ?
- a bit of both
i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
- catherine , it 's useless now
- right
it 's useless
- samuel ?
- marcoux ?
bianche ?
- i want to see him again
- very interesting , so to conclude
- those inhumane treatments were forced upon twelve innocent people for highly immoral research
- so , there are still missing chapters to this story
you will be reporting those soon
- oh yes , absolutely , marc
i can already tell you that the topic of this secret research should surprise everyone
- very interesting mr
tune in next week marc bonsecours saying see you soon
- where are you ?
- i 'm in front of blanche 's house - you 're asking yourself if you have saved your soul ?
- if i 've saved my soul ?
well , if it means that i 'm able to look forward despite what 's behind
yes
i think so
- are you going to drop the bottle ?
- well , it 's actually very quiet in great bear , isn 't it ?
- it is except when you 're there
- bye lapointe
- are you there ?
yeah , sorry it was lapointe
i couldn 't - i 'm in my bath too now
- oh yeah ?
sorry , it 's funny because it 's the first time that
i imagine you
- and ?
- well
- to begin i will tell you how i killed my mother
- hey luc
you 're up late again tonight ?
in the iast episode
- avery bad cycle has begun
- if i catch the guy who did this
- we 'ii catch him marcoux we 'ii catch him and he 's going to pay
- the body seems to have been partially buried then dragged on the ground
- you went strolling outside with the old woman , in the middle of the night , without any apparent reason
aii of a sudden , a kind of shadow attacked you you fainted and you never saw her alive again
- mr mayor : you deserve nine out of ten
- sir ? you lost this
you 'ii be needing it
- man , that 's poitras ' face
- i iove giibert
that 's why i 'ii go down after the sixth round against taylor
- ah fuck ! - i 'm not a fag , ok ?
- boys !
- i 'ii call the others
i 'm not a fag
somebody fired a shot
my god , sophie , i 'm sorry
is there anything i can do ?
not one word on what happened , ok ?
i heard a shot , i came right away but there was no one here
he shot himself before someone else did
don 't say that , the guys aren 't crazy
they wouldn 't have killed him for a couple grants
you think ?
not for that either :
look
" i 'm not a fag "
can you believe it ?
what were you all doing here ?
well
we all gather here to talk about blanche
i 've invited you before
bianche is dead
so ?
we can still talk about her
you believe she transmitted her powers , iike she said ?
don 't you ?
i believe in what i see
and these days , the picture isn 't very nice
bianche also believed in what she saw except she saw a iot more and a iot further than we do
i know you 've secretly been to see her too
i beg your pardon ?
once or twice
out of curiosity , iike everyone else
when the bear growls , it will be exactly 9am
you 're tuned in to great bear radio , with simone letendre
so , mr mayor ?
everything is under control
still , there have been three suspicious deaths within a week
i can 't keep people from shooting themselves
i mean
i 'm deeply sorry for the families it 's tragic
as for mrs von trieck , i 'm grieving like everyone else
the investigation is under way but let 's not put the horses before the cart
- ha ! the horses
- still , she 's the most liked and respected woman in town
any leads ? suspects ? anything at all ?
- horses in front of the cart
- the priority is the safety of the population
we obviously have several leads , i can 't give any details
- come on ! come on !
give them details !
- people seem to think that you don 't know the details
what people ?
- everybody
- and what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
people would iike to know when it will come back
i made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
in my days , there was no television
- in other words , you have no clue what 's going on
well thank you mr mayor for the enlightenment - that 's right !
thank you very much you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- poor blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
i 'm starting to understand her
too bad i 'm leaving ; i couid have told you what to do with her
never mind simone
you can 't leave ;
you 're a witness in a murder investigation
might as well make the most of it and do a story
biron , i 'm tired , i need some rest
- do you think we ever got any rest ?
we worked twelve hours a day and at night
nothing ever happens in great bear
then , you come here , there 's a murder , a manhunt , suicides , tv freaks out
biron i have nothing to do with your farfetched tales
- i won 't fetch anything very far , at my age
when i found you last night , there was this paper at your feet
are you writing poetry ? - poetry is boring
but at christmas time , sometimes we 'd sing songs
- yeah , that 's it i write poetry
don 't forget what blanche said ;
your fate is linked to hers
my fate i 'm not dead
what is a dead person 's fate ?
- poor blanche
- follow me , i 'ii show you
- we 'd sing what was it that we 'd sing ?
" the paddle leads us round and round "
the paddle leads us round and round
she got me the old bat !
she got me
and the elections are coming up
fanatics ;
it could cost me my mayor 's job
bianche was all that 's good in the world , all put together in the same person , who would listen to them and guide them
she told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - no way !
- how would you know ?
lapointe 's deposition
yeah , that 's what he told me at the hospital , word for word
big surprise !
why would it have changed ?
what did they teach you at police academy ?
why would he lie ?
bianche left him a paper with clues we should follow
hey , the case is muddy enough without me worrying about the old woman 's hallucinations
forget it !
about suzanne ferron ; i 'm starting to think i 'm wasting my time
proofs were erased , purposely you don 't say ?
by the way the cleaners will be there tomorrow morning , before thomas gets out of the hospital
in the mean time , don 't touch anything and keep your nose out of it
look sarah ; daddy 's in top shape
oh yes !
now i 've got it !
i don 't know why i didn 't think of it sooner !
another stroke of genius ?
hey , hey !
don 't mock me little miss ferron
i 'm thinking of changing my last name
i 'ii take my mother 's
there 's an idea !
your father 's gonna have a cow !
i 'd say it looks like you hate him as much as i do
i 'm sorry about blanche
yeah
i 'm sorry about your mother too
she still hasn 't said a word eh ?
poor child
hey guys !
we 're closing up
i 've got an idea
fantastic ?
extraordinary ?
insane ?
aii of the above !
do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us ? because of what we did with blanche 's book ?
of course not
gilbert thibodeau never needed any help to get into trouble
i don 't feel so good since blanche is gone
everything is backwards and
i 'm scared
you 're too sensitive honey
bianche wouldn 't have liked us playing with forces we can 't control
sophie was putting us on
you really think she left her body and saw blanche with wires coming out of her head ?
she rose above the table , you saw her
well , iet 's keep that between us for now , ok ? yeah
wait for me ; i 'ii give you a lift
i 've never felt that way in all my iife , pierre
i felt myself leave
i don 't know where but i was floating
come here
i think i-i-i 'm gonna go now
pierre , pierre , come lay down , you 're tired
no , no
i felt powerful and free
excuse me
what 's the matter ?
hey !
if you 're gay too , then i 'm the one who 's gonna shoot myself
no , that 's not it
i just can 't ! you 're played the tease long enough
at first , it turned me on but it 's not funny anymore , pierre
it wasn 't my intention sophie , i 'm sorry
if it 's because of gilbert , you know there was nothing left between us i have to go
pierre , i need a man !
i need you
hurry up biron ; i 'm having a shitty day
you better have a good reason to bring me back here
but you 'ii find the " cream of the crop " of great bear here you should enjoy that
i have nothing against cream ;
it 's sour milk i can 't stand
aii right , ok i see everybody 's in a good mood this morning
would you put that on , please gastonne ?
i thought all the tvs in town had nothing but snow ?
yeah but this is just a monitor
there 's no antenna , nothing to receive the waves , it takes it 's signal from the vcr
biron , i know what a monitor is
ok , now , look at this
indeed
look at that
- he can 't leave his wife like this - my vcr was programmed to record when it happened
- so i 'ii go down during the sixth round against taylor that 's fine and dandy but
wait wait wait
- just for him
watch this
what ?
there
well
i 'ii be damned it 's that bear
the old woman 's stuffed bear
that 's right
bianche 's didn 't tape her meetings with people
no , but there 's something there
there 's got to be a link between blanche 's murder and poitras and the tv
and the rabbits that appeared during poitras ' fight
- well , why not ?
it would be logical i don 't know if it 's logical but it reminds me that something 's not right with your deposition
bianche 's big book you were talking about ;
the night she was killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
yes , the book
very nice , with a leather binding
we searched everywhere ;
well , the killer took off with it then ?
i 've got an idea come on biron
hey ! woah !
what idea ?
i don 't work for the police but you 're still a suspect
it 's to your advantage to cooperate
you 'ii get the autopsy report on the old woman ?
give us a copy and we 'ii tell you what we have found on our end
ok , ok
but not a word to my father eh ?
i 'm not supposed to get involved in that
no , no , no
we have a story now , don 't we ?
what 's your idea ? to get the autopsy report
that 's a good one
but what do we do for gastonne ;
we 've got nothing for her you see biron ; we have to reconstitute the events of that night , right ?
we have to speak with blanche 's son ; he was in the house too
the autopsy report should help us reconstruct the facts and put the pieces together
ah , cool but what do we do for gastonne ?
i have to take a shower , biron
come on , iet 's go
a gala ?
a gala ?
a gala
sarah , hand me your drawings
music !
comedy !
fights !
magic !
cocktails ! a memorable evening of entertainment !
people are looking for distractions , it 's gonna fly big !
so we test the show here , then we take it on the road
woah , and sarah ; you did all this to illustrate the evening ?
super , boss !
where do we start ? listen , we need big names
poitras , our champion , is in town
- but poitras he 's , shall we say out of commission
- and grieving
- gilbert - grieving ?
so ?
i 'm grieving too
life goes on guys
life is bigger than everything , guys
live doesn 't stop here eh ?
against the odds !
he must have really loved his giibert
to be this sad with thirty milligrams of morphine in your blood
never seen anything like it
what 's up with you ?
did you call me here to talk about my wardrobe ?
no i want to know how mom died
you know it , dad knows it and i don 't know why you 're protecting him
if he 's threatening you , you 'd better tell me
i 'ii help you that time is over stef
i don 't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
if someone falls down , you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
and when they 're too much of a burden
you take off
look at me look at mom
you 're such an asshole
oh yeah ! that 's another thing ;
i 'm done being nice
as of now , i 'm an asshole
now , if you 'ii excuse me , i have a meeting to get to
- excuse me stephanie ;
i 'm looking for dr mondoux
it 's for an autopsy report
my mother 's ?
no blanche 's
because your mother yes , she was incinerated the same night
i know everybody knows
yeah
anyway
don 't bother gastonne , it 's useless now
according to mondoux , she was partially buried , and then dragged for a good distance after her death
why would a killer bring his victim back in her own house ?
i don 't know
yeah
these marks are identical to the ones you 'd find on the skin of people on whom they tested a device invented by a certain doctor edouard paquette
edouard who ?
paquette
edouard paquette
mondoux has tried to contact him but he couldn 't get a hold of him
- no , no tell mondoux tell him , i 'ii take care of it
everything 's under control
i can help you , trust me what did i tell you ?
there 's no " dad " on the job ok ?
why don 't you go out for a while ?
i have to think now
josee , call agent corbeii from national security , it 's urgent
good ; i taped my stand up
quite a number that one !
soft , vulnerable one minute , cold and cruel the next
i wish i 'd figured her out that quickly
she gets to you doesn 't she ?
yeah , but i 'm done groveiing good for you
i know the type
they use men either as a doormat or as a pedestal
the important thing is that they can walk all over them
in fact , these girls are born unhappy and stay that way
you seem to know what you 're talking about i 've known a iot of women biron
before finding the right one
you , biron
you wouldn 't do that would you ? use someone to get ahead ?
uh no , no
i mean , love has to be an exchange otherwise it 's unhealthy
well , miss catherine
you know , i 've done a iot of thinking , in fact ,
i haven 't slept all night and
i 've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you 'ii accept a date
you bargain your indulgences
ah but it was my friend biron who said that love has to be an exchange
i accept but find something original
that 's another type one should stay away from
that 's more the type you 'ii never get close to , biron
i 'm not interested anyway
where are we going ?
i didn 't see anything the night of the murder
i was at home watching tv and i had a seizure
now , i don 't want to hear about my mother 's scary tales anymore
biron , you should know that
yes but , it 's important , it might be linked to her death
i always said it was going to kill her
i don 't want to hear about her or her books anymore , ok ?
don 't you see i 'm trying to forget ? ah yes , that 's right , she told me she had two big books
you know , with leather bindings
they seemed very important to her
right , two books
according to the stupid legend , my mother 's powers were passed on from one woman to another and they would each write their chapter full of nonsense in there there would be thirteen chapters per book
well now , the the books have disappeared
just as well
honey , we 're in a bit of a hurry right now
what 's the matter ?
kitten ? do you have a fever ?
you 're burning up
you 're all red kitten
in two years , it 's the first time that it 's so
i don 't know
no , no i wasn 't saying
i mean i don 't want to sound corny but
when i wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
i 'ii always remember the first day i set foot in here and blanche introduced us
she knew right away that it wouid work between us , huh ?
we 'ii miss her eh ? oui
sorry
it 's the emotions
that little brat !
where the hell is gastonne ?
about time
here 's the autopsy report
what have you found ?
we spoke to thomas von trieck at the hospital
would you have a pocket-knife or something ?
no , why ?
bianche didn 't have one big book ; she had two
yeah , so ? well , i don 't know
do you have a screwdriver ?
we 'd have to read them to know
we 'd have to find them first
and the piece of paper that blanche gave to lapointe in the woods , did you find it ?
oh , that
hello
i iove you
you 're the only one
i hope so !
christian doesn 't want to see me anymore
i don 't understand ; he hates me
he doesn 't really hate you
aii my iife , all i 've been trying to do is save the world and i can 't do it
that 's not true
you saved me
when you found me ,
i was all messed up with a biker gang after me
without you , i was lost
still today
you 're sweet , but i 'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
from now on , it an eye for an eye
what will revenge get you ?
look at lapointe who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
what was that ?
hey !
moron !
you want me to to book you in ?
thank you
we don 't have much for you but after our visit to the von trieck 's , we should be able to help you biron !
don 't go in there
it 's a secured area
sam
sam
come on , it 's late
- hey ! hello gorgeous !
hi !
hey , guys ! look how nice she is to her little brother
eh sam ?
she 's so nice to you
it 's not lack of respect ; i worry about you
it was an accident
it 'ii pass , we must look ahead
i don 't believe in accidents
and not only for suzanne
when something happens , when someone is born
stop , catherine stop
stop torturing yourself
if only you wanted to
that child is my son too stop !
if only you had wanted
i ioved you so much georges
and for so long it 's not possible anymore
catherine
you and me ; we can 't let it end
it lasted this long , despite everything
take the time to think about it
you should get some rest
yes , you 're right
i have to get some rest
i have to get some rest but
stay right where you are !
from now on , i 'm your partner what ?
i take a third of the profits on everything that 's illegal
i don 't give a damn about
but i have plans for the bar
there 'ii be shows in here we have to hurry
there 's no tv , people need entertainment
but for starters , you 'ii tell me all about the deal you were making when i walked in with mom
i want my share
you have about ten seconds to decide
you want to go to jail ?
fine , i 'ii go too but you 're not going to blackmail me
christian , we can talk about it but
hello , gastonne ?
christian ferron hi
uh what 's up ?
christian ?
christian ?
hello marcoux ?
beiiveau
no , not robert , gastonne , smart-ass !
you 're not on duty tonight
i have a question for you
what 's that ?
honestly
do you think i 'm a good cop ? eh well
that 's what i thought
sophie , where 's your daughter now ?
at her grandmother 's
i think blanche 's soul is still close to us
yes , when i saw her , she was tied up , she seemed imprisoned
imprisoned by what ?
by what , i don 't know
but when giibert
i mean , there was a bang and i fell back down
sophie , sophie , we 'ii just go now
yeah aunt sophie , or we 'ii stay and you can go get some rest
no , no , no we can 't leave blanche in that state
what can we do ?
we have to decode blanche 's book
i 'm sure the answer is in there
her book bianche never allowed us to touch it
yet , she gave it to pierre
why him ?
good question
well , there 's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
bianche gave you that paper you threw it out
then a little boy brought it back to you
and when you were on the verge of giving up , the crazy old man at the restaurant started singing : " the paddle leads us round and round "
biron , that was the purpose of the first sentence
keep me from giving up and keep me here , in great bear yes !
that 's just like blanche
ok read the second sentence
" he who gathers the mane has seen and will see again "
" he who gathers the mane has seen and will see again "
isn 't there a story about some golden mane ?
the mane the mane
according to gastonne 's report , they found nothing in the bear 's fur , nothing in blanche 's hair
it 's not really a mane but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
that 's odd , isn 't it ?
yeah but with all people that come to see her , it 's kind of normal
but biron , there certainly wasn 't twelve people that went under the chair in one day
he who gathers the mane the mane
there must be a hair salon in great bear ?
- who works there ?
it 's it 's
he does
you 're trying my patience son
come on , get the strap !
you never hesitated before !
georges , iet him go
- mr ferron ?
- what do you want mike ?
turn on your tv , quick !
i 'ii let you think about it until tomorrow
it 's not that you 're not a good cop it 's it 's just not natural for you your mind is too nuanced , know what i mean ?
so , to be a good cop , you have to be narrow minded ?
no , seriously , gastonne ; what made you become a cop ?
why ?
you mean , " who made me ? "
you followed someone to the academy ?
i ran away from someone who hurt me
you , the first day you arrived in great bear , you found the woman of your dreams
two years already
i spend my iife in great bear and
- attention all units there 's someone else on tv
it 's
keep an eye out in case things heat up
who is it ?
marcoux ! find that person and make sure they 're safe
so far , it has meant bad luck to
pierre lamy , it 's pierre lamy
it 's pierre lamy
her ?
she doesn 't know
i couldn 't tell her because she loves me and i don 't want her to stop
gastonne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
no
to have both sexes isn 't being a man
i have one ovary and one testicle
i 'm not a man
if you could see it
if gastonne saw it
yes
i 'd rather hurt her
i 'd rather she went away
i 'd rather
anything but that
hey ! imagine that !
you can with yourself
yeah
how do you do it ?
that 's it !
that 's him !
him what ?
that 's why blanche gave him the book
pierre is the heiress to her powers
oh my god !
hello ?
doctor , are you in your office ?
well , yes , obviously
doctor
doctor , tell me you 're alone ?
alone ?
of course i 'm
doctor ?
doctor !
in the iast episode - avery bad cycle has begun
- hold me tight armand
- they can 't stand themselves without tv
look at them !
they 're all watching out for the next scandal
- look at them closely ; they 're shaking they 're all shitting their pants for fear of being the next one
- gastonne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
- what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
- i made a call to competent authorities this morning to have them send us their top experts
- paquette is the only one who can help us to understand what 's going on
- he reads the rats ' thoughts ?
- better than that , he turns them into images
- if he knew i slept with practically everything in a uniform in great bear
- well thank you mr mayor you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who savagely killed our beloved blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
- you seem to know what you 're talking about
- i have known a iot of women biron , before finding my own
- see you again soon , mr lapointe
- so , the next one would be : " got cells "
- yeah , well , they 've been in order since the beginning
- got cells , got cells , got cells , got cells , got cells
- come on , come on !
- my glove
that 's armand
stop it sweetheart
mommy 's doing this for your own good
what 's wrong ?
oh no
biron , samuel said : " got cells "
georges , have you seen it ?
what should we do ?
- i don 't know
he hasn 't said anything yet ;
maybe he won 't say anything at all
about us anyway
- i doubt that i 'ii call you back , ok ?
- ok
mommy will be back
madame von trieck ;
promise me that you will never tell stephanie
- armand , what hurts people the most isn 't what we tell them but what we don 't
- no
if i told stephanie i 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that i do worse things than before , she wouldn 't understand that i 'm doing it for her
- i know
- no , you don 't
- yes
her name is dove
she 's beautiful and wild and she 's after you because you betrayed her
that 's why you 're hiding in great bear
- but how
- you told stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- it 's true i didn 't want anything to do with the business anymore and dove had put a hit on my head
- yes , beautiful dove is mad at you , but it 's not a business matter :
it 's her heart you betrayed
like you 're betraying stephanie by not telling her
- no i iove her
- yes , and you will tell her
- no !
never !
- oh yes , i can see it
she will learn everything from your own mouth
never trust anyone , sarah
no one
ah !
lapointe
biron , she kissed me , right here !
- good for you in the mean time , heiene marcoux 's brother said the fourth sentence
and armand lafiamme appeared on tv
this is where you were coming from the other day
- you must be very careful ; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bicycle
- hey , don 't give me orders , buddy
- hey , calm down !
i wouldn 't have expected that from you
i only told them who to call to find the material and the ingredients
from there , it 's just a recipe
hello ?
yes , armand is here what ?
ok , fine we 'ii wait here
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing we wait here
- what 's going on ?
- i told you , nothing
hey , what do you do with that ?
- you are the worst liar i 've ever heard
- don 't you get it ?
the days when you pretended to be a good boy and fucked my sister are over i 'm the boss now
you 're acting just like your father and you always said he was a dumb-ass
- you never stop , do you ?
my father said to wait here
i don 't know what 's going on but if something 's happened to stephanie
you believe pierre 's story now ?
- biron , i said , " let 's suppose "
listen to this
the night she died ,
bianche leaves with me for the woods , ok ?
meanwhile , pierre goes into the house to look in the book
in the woods , someone knocks me out , kills the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught , probably by sarah and her friends , who , according to pierre , brought the body home
so , chances are sarah saw the killer
- well , probably probably according to pierre there 's a chance
come on , that story will never fly
- no , no , biron
it would explain the footprints in the kitchen , the haif-done burial and the return of the body to the house
- let 's suppose , iike you say
but it 's probably after ten o 'ciock right now
little sarah , who doesn 't speak , is probably asleep
and according to me , chances are stephanie won 't welcome you with much hospitality
- ah ! biron , you 're absolutely right
- right
- so
oh no !
that girl intimidates me
- biron , all girls intimidate you
- hi
- hi
this might seem strange but it 's a iong story but
i 'd iike to talk to sarah - sarah 's in bed
come back some other time if you want to play with her , ok ?
- it 's really important
i i have some questions for her
biron , she hasn 't said a word
yes , i know but
that idiot lapointe sent you , is that it ?
can 't he mind his own business ?
- no , that wasn 't him
i mean i 'm quite capable of myself
i just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- she saw someone take off on a four-wheeier
that 's all
- on a four-wheeier
- the little brat is here !
come on biron !
armand
stef !
are you ok ?
i thought something had happened to you
- you were right
just tell me you 're not associated with my father
oh no oh no
- what is it ?
- i saw him he can 't be very far
- who ?
- got him !
come here !
that 's the little boy who gave me blanche 's paper
- luc , what are you doing here this late ?
- you like staying up late , don 't you ?
look you gave me that paper eh ?
where did you get it ?
and how did you know it was mine ?
- luc , luc , luc you and sarah and the others , when 's the iast time you saw mrs von trieck ?
- i don 't remember
- listen luc , huh ?
it 's very important that you tell us when you saw
mrs von trieck for the iast time
- the last time ? - yes
- yes
- it 's when she gave us pops the other day
stay here
you little bastard , get over here
get over here !
- your son stays out late
- he 's not my father
- stay here
- what 's your problem ?
you fancy little boys ?
is that it ?
- come on rick , relax
- you 're right luc : run
you 're better off outside than with him
- i have to bring him back to his mother if i want to have any fun tonight
come on , get over here hurry up !
but we 'ii see each other again , you and i
what will become of this child ?
- he doesn 't look like the kind of kid who would be dragging corpses in the middle of the night
his problems are elsewhere
- some days , biron , humanity discourages me , you have no idea
don 't listen to blanche don 't listen to blanche it 's dangerous
- but somebody 's got to do it
- no , not you
- somebody 's got to do it
