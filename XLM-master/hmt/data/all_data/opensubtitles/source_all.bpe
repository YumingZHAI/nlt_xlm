no , tv still isn 't back but we were treated to a new episode star@@ ring one of our cit@@ iz@@ ens , last night
poor arm@@ and , poor stephanie
ah , but it 's not easy finding love
each time we open the door to our heart to let love in , we never know what else can get in at the same time , huh ?
fear , pain , mal@@ ice
but maybe also ten@@ dern@@ ess , joy , happiness
who knows ?
we never know
- happy birthday darling !
but , marie , i don 't drink
one glass of wine and i 'm drunk
- this is for the day i leave you
you won 't be able to do without this

- keep it
but i never want you to use it because i '@@ ii never leave you
- i promise
where is my real gift ?
- come here
marie !
ok , the paper in doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's hand : did you find out what it is ?
- yeah
- and ?
what were you doing at the von trie@@ ck 's last night ?
- we wanted to talk to sarah
- what did she say ?
- well nothing
- what was the doctor 's paper ?
- give me a break ok ?
we had an agreement
since the beginning i 've given you all i 've had and i don 't get anything back in return
- yes i know - you 're hiding things from me
you went to see pierre too
did he give you the idea to talk to sarah ?
what did he say to you ? - go ask him , you '@@ ii find out
he doesn 't want to speak to me and everyone at the station thinks he 's a fre@@ ak
- you don 't say ?
- hey there , bottle neck
quit it , all right ?
sp@@ it it out or else
- swear that you won 't use it against pierre
- bir@@ on , you can 't sell out your sources to the police like that
- you can 't treat my friends this way either
- hey that 's him
- pierre was at blanche 's house the night she died
he said he saw the kids bring her body back
- come on the kids didn 't kill blanche
- no , i don 't think so either but stephanie said sarah saw someone take off on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier
- aren 't you
that famous journalist ?
- yeah , aren 't you ?
bernard
- yeah , yeah , louis-@@ bernard l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
- that 's it !
that 's it ! - well hi
- hi
- hi
so what about sam@@ u@@ ei 's sent@@ ence ? " got cell@@ s " ?
- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te thinks it has to do with the accident ten years ago , but
- the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ?
- yeah , the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- don 't you have , i@@ ike a talent , a magic trick or something ?
or a mal@@ formation or a scar
- come on
- what ? scar@@ s are cool
- no , no i won 't be a clo@@ wn in your fre@@ ak show , all right ?
- if you change your mind
- no , i won 't change my mind , forget it ok ?
- let 's go we '@@ ii stop bo@@ thering mr big star
- so , now that the sto@@ ol pi@@ geon has talked , could we find out what was on doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's paper ?
- a small piece of a scientif@@ ic magazine
- like any of the hund@@ reds in his office great !
- like any of the hund@@ reds , yes
but why that one ?
i did some research ;
it 's from " neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence en avant "
and guess who 's on the cover ?
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
the sci@@ ent@@ ist who 's in great bear to fix the tv signal
i ordered the magazine from the national library
- which will probably get here in two to three days
so , in the mean time
bir@@ on ?
in the mean time , tell me the story of the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- there were twelve guys
- we call them the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s but they didn 't really have any skil@@ ls
kind of the lo@@ ser@@ s of the area
and when you 're considered a loser in great bear
- cream of the cro@@ p for sure
- the municipality hi@@ red them to work on a piece of land where they would have put up a radar station
- a radar station ?
but , that 's not municipal department
- i just called the mayor 's office
the documents about that contr@@ act have disappeared from the files
- we have to talk to the mayor , to your father
- he won 't say anything
if the documents aren 't there , he decided it
if they still ex@@ ist though , i know where they are
in the safe in his office
- let me guess ; the problem is that he 's the only one who knows the combin@@ ation
- no , the problem is that he 's the only one who has the key
and he always ke@@ eps it on him
- i have good news and bad news
- the bad news ?
- there 's no doubt the waves produc@@ ing the images on tv are of ident@@ ical nature to the ones i was ob@@ tain@@ ing with my dev@@ ice , ten years ago
- incredi@@ ble the good news ?
- i 've identi@@ fied what could be the emit@@ ting source or at ie@@ ast a rel@@ ay
those dis@@ hes down there
- we 're getting closer
- who could be doing that ?
a@@ ii of my ex-@@ co@@ ii@@ abor@@ ators have been contac@@ ted , it 's beyond me
- exactly whoever is do@@ ings this is beyond you pa@@ qu@@ ette
i find this most excit@@ ing
the more reason for me to worry
i don 't want to interview edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
i just want to talk to him for two minutes
what 's the difference ?
listen , can you just tell me where i can find him ?
- even gast@@ onne can 't talk to him
ok , after " got cell@@ s " ?
" be there where the thie@@ f dances "
what does that mean ?
every time we get a lead , it goes absolutely nowhere
we have a new sent@@ ence which gives us a new lead and it 's a complete mess
- no , no bir@@ on
those lead@@ s don 't stop , they slow down
and they all point in the same direction
- oh yeah ?
which one ? - i don 't know yet
but i trust blanche 's clu@@ es
- so , go join pierre lam@@ y 's gang
- the hair@@ dres@@ ser ?
actually , i 'm certain we 'd find very interesting things in that book he took from blanche 's house
- blanche 's big book is full of old w@@ ives ' tales spread over thir@@ teen gener@@ ations
- bir@@ on , to sol@@ ve a problem , you have to go back to its orig@@ ins
you have to cut it at the ro@@ ot
fine ok
not only are the lead@@ s we have absolutely lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us , they 're cold as ice
the only concre@@ te fac@@ ts we have are the article about edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette found in doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's hand and the missing file on the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette , don 't you find that strange ?
a neur@@ olog@@ ist to fix a tv signal problem ?
- that accident always seemed very strange to me
and now , the tv fre@@ aks out
we have to open bei@@ iv@@ eau 's safe
- no , that 's il@@ legal
- i don 't give a damn
at least , it isn 't " es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic b@@ lah b@@ lah " ; it 's concre@@ te stuff
- picking the chief of police 's pocket never did any@@ body any good
i have an idea
bei@@ iv@@ eau might be the chief
hello ?
this is em@@ i@@ ie bir@@ on , yes
you wanted louis-@@ bernard l@@ apo@@ in@@ te for your gala ?
you shall have him
- out of the question !
- under one condition
- no , no , no !

- mr fer@@ ron !

montreal will be phon@@ ing in two seconds

hello
- christian , you '@@ ii have to admit that our second date can 't be any worse than the first
- did you know that your voice is really sexy ?
- i won 't say i 've never been told before
i have a feeling we '@@ ii get along , you and i , christian
our deal will go a iot smo@@ other this time , right ?
- the first time , we didn 't know each other
i 've told you my name , what 's yours ?
- call me bird - it 's do@@ ve , isn 't it ?
- what ?
- i gues@@ sed it , didn 't i ?
your voice is so soft , it su@@ its you , do@@ ve
- you don 't scar@@ e me with your big guns
you don 't want to tell me your real name ?
i '@@ ii call you do@@ ve - ok
- do@@ ve ?

hus@@ h , you can 't make any noise
people will hear you , stop it
i don 't know what i was expecting by coming here so late tonight , if only to see you again for a moment
hope to see you soon
sarah is asleep
don 't worry , things will work out
- i just wonder where great bear is going without blanche
- to hell most likely
but you know , she isn 't really gone yet
- you feel her too ?
but it 's like she 's mu@@ te , like sarah
- do you know why the nat@@ ives never settled near great bear ?
- no
- when i was young , one of my really old gre@@ at-@@ aun@@ ts came to visit from holland
my grand@@ father showed her around the mine and the town
in those days it was still the " von trie@@ ck mine "
he was proud
then my gre@@ at-@@ aunt , who had pretty much the same powers as blanche , asks my grand@@ father what " re@@ frac@@ ting stones " are
so my grand@@ father expl@@ ains ;
re@@ frac@@ ting stones are rocks used to build chim@@ ne@@ ys , stones that you can heat up as much as you want they will never crack
when she he@@ ars that , my gre@@ at-@@ aunt is over@@ taken by verti@@ go and starts shou@@ ting : " stop !
stop ! "
you should have seen it ;
the guys in the mine were fre@@ aking out
so my grand@@ father takes her by the shoulders and asks her :
" what 's the matter ? "
she man@@ ages to catch her breath , and all cros@@ s-@@ eyed , starts saying : " you shouldn 't move this rock , it is rock that never bur@@ ns ;
god put it there to block the gates of hell
if you keep dig@@ ging , demons from the ab@@ y@@ ss will come to the surface and tor@@ ment you "
then my grand@@ father grab@@ s her , sho@@ ves her in the truck and says : " crazy old woman , go back where you came from , you proph@@ et of doom ! "
well , you know what ?
the nat@@ ives had the same legend pretty much word for word
that 's why they never settled near great bear
- so what ?
you think that
- i think i don 't like proph@@ ets of doom !
- come on , bi@@ an@@ che wasn 't a proph@@ et of doom !
- how would you know , fer@@ ron ?
no , but really
how would you know ?
- rum and co@@ ke , just the way you i@@ ike it
i 'm glad you came by
i have things to be for@@ given for
- oh yeah ?
what 's that ?
- you can go
i 'm not keeping you
- you know very well what i want
- you know very well that i won 't give it to you
you '@@ ii have to wait until the deal is done to get your share , like the rest of us
- i need money to leave town
and if do@@ ve knows i 'm involved , it 's not good for you either
- i know , but if do@@ ve fin@@ ds you , she '@@ ii kill you
so i bet you '@@ ii make sure she doesn 't know you 're here
see how much i trust you ?
- i 'm not alone in this
what about christian ?
do you really trust him ?
- he 's my son
i 'm giving him a chance to ear@@ n my trust
lay low for a few days and everything will be fine
- you like it ?
- huh ? what ?
- you like it , eh ?
- yes , yes , yes , em@@ i@@ ie , em@@ i@@ ie !
em@@ i@@ ie , em@@ i@@ ie !
- yeah , yeah , yeah
- let 's go
- where ?
- i don 't know
a@@ ii she said was : " i have to talk to you "
then she hung up come on , hurry up !
- no , i 'm much better now
i should be going
you got what you wanted ?
yeah
it 's been clear , lat@@ ely , that i will never have anything else
even this , i didn 't think anyway
- emile
what l@@ apo@@ in@@ te said about me that i 'm an opport@@ un@@ ist and un@@ happy
- ah , forget about that
- no , no , there 's truth in that , i know
but i 'd i@@ ike you to give me a second chance , because
i don 't want to stay un@@ happy
think about it , ok ?
yeah , ok
i '@@ ii think about it
she 's here
- would you stop saying " she " ?
- he , she it doesn 't matter
- forgive me girls i haven 't slept in two days
i 'm trans@@ lat@@ ing the book
- and what does it say ?
- a iot of things but
this isn 't blanche 's book
- what do you mean , it isn 't blanche 's book ?
bi@@ an@@ che gave it to you
- she didn 't give it to me
i took it
- so , what does that change ?
- you st@@ ole it
that changes everything
he 's not the hei@@ ress to the powers
- explain yourself
- every one of these books was written over thir@@ teen gener@@ ations
- yes , one chapter per generation , and ?
- the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter of this book has already been written
- then blanche wrote the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h
- blanche didn 't write in this book
and she didn 't write the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter of any book
- what do you mean ?
- get it out of here !
get it out !
- take the book outside !
pierre , pierre , it 's all right
it 's ok , it 's all right
we have to get him to the hospital
go look in the back , there must be a whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row
we '@@ ii roll him to the car
the
the book is gone
are you sure ?
at dawn on a spring day in 15@@ 28 , a span@@ ish fle@@ et from cuba prepared to land an army of conquist@@ ad@@ ors on the sho@@ res of north america ,
they had come to find new lands of gold
it was thur@@ s@@ day the 14@@ th of april , 15@@ 28 , when they came as@@ hor@@ e .
the beginning of the most dis@@ astro@@ us of all the expedit@@ ions of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors , and yet one of the great epic stories in the history of the americ@@ as .
the span@@ ish had called this florida , the land of flowers ,
but they found a strange and evil country ,
that summer , over 300 conquist@@ ad@@ ors struggled through these sw@@ amp@@ s ,
their leader , pan@@ ph@@ ilo de nar@@ va@@ ez , was arro@@ g@@ ant and in@@ compet@@ ent ,
they had no interpre@@ ters , their food supp@@ lies ran out ,
and worse , they were picked off by host@@ ile trib@@ es ,
the last survi@@ vor@@ s of those nat@@ ive pe@@ op@@ les are still here , the semin@@ ole ,
they have fier@@ cel@@ y defen@@ ded their indepen@@ dence ever since ,
so you are the only nat@@ ive american people within the usa who never sub@@ mit@@ ted ...
right . the only tri@@ be to never sign a treat@@ y of sub@@ mission .
the elements of florida , a very , very good ally .
s@@ nak@@ es and al@@ lig@@ ators , europe@@ ans worried more about them .
again , these people had no knowledge of florida .
nar@@ va@@ ez had been lic@@ en@@ sed by the king of sp@@ ain to disco@@ ver and conqu@@ er florida ,
he hoped to find cities here with large populations and gold
instead , he found a poor lands@@ cape totally un@@ suit@@ able for colon@@ isation ,
but he pushed his army on further into the nightmare ,
" if only nar@@ va@@ ez had come here to se@@ ek the well-@@ being of the indi@@ ans , " one span@@ i@@ ard wrote , " and not to wa@@ de through their blood to gain il@@ l-@@ gotten wealth , "
but his capac@@ ities did not come up to his dreams ,
with au@@ tum@@ n coming on , the expedition was on the point of collap@@ se ,
hoping now just to save their lives , they struggled down to the sea below tal@@ lah@@ as@@ see ,
but there was no sign of their ships ,
the fle@@ et had given them up for dead
they 're star@@ ving , dis@@ il@@ lus@@ ion@@ ed , and nar@@ va@@ ez we@@ ighs up the situation .
he thinks the span@@ ish sett@@ lem@@ ents in mexico are only a few le@@ ag@@ ues down the coast .
in fact , they 're 1,000 miles .
so he deci@@ des to build bo@@ ats to escape .
and on the 22@@ nd of september , nearly 300 survi@@ vor@@ s set sa@@ il in five bar@@ ges .
( thunder )
in terrible weather , they tried to sa@@ il across the gul@@ f of mexico , past the mississippi ,
nar@@ va@@ ez himself was never seen again ,
we would know nothing of this story , but for the captain of one of the bar@@ ges , a young span@@ ish gentlem@@ an called a l@@ var nun@@ ez cabeza de v@@ aca ,
cabeza de v@@ aca wrote a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le account of his advent@@ ures and with it we set out to follow him across the gul@@ f of mexico , to find out which way wind and ti@@ de might have taken him that au@@ tum@@ n ,
he was coming out of this part of florida ,
the green arro@@ ws indic@@ ate the current and speed and , as you see , it gets pretty swift .
- along the mississippi delta .
- the arro@@ ws show the pre@@ domin@@ ant direction ?
the pre@@ domin@@ ant direction of the current .
0@@ c@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , a lot of fron@@ ts come through , push the wind off@@ shore and those tend to be very strong win@@ ds that 'll push off@@ shore .
the pre@@ domin@@ ant wind is from the sou@@ the@@ ast .
that 's interesting .
when they pass the mississippi mouth , they get caught up in a storm coming from the north that blo@@ ws them right out to sea and nearly dro@@ wns them , in fact .
" in the end , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" we commen@@ ded our@@ selves to god and the dang@@ ers of the sea ,
" and there was not a man among us who did not think that death was certain ,
" none of us had any idea of ha@@ vig@@ ation ,
" for six weeks we were lost , " eating rotten ma@@ ize , drinking sea water , which drove some men mad
" i was at the hel@@ m that night , i had prepared to die ,
" and then , in the darkness , we heard break@@ ers , " we were near land "
it was the 6@@ th of november , 15@@ 28 ,
at dawn , they came in@@ shore ,
but the boat cap@@ siz@@ ed in the sur@@ f ,
too weak to sw@@ im , some of the men were dro@@ wned
they found themselves on a wind@@ swept shore un@@ seen before by white men ,
gal@@ vest@@ on island , texas ,
how far up do you think they went ?
you know , given how weak he was , i don 't think he probably went much further than you 're going .
0@@ ne of them climbed an oak tree to see where they were ,
- i can see it !
i can see the bay !
- yeah .
i think they gues@@ sed the island was about half a league wide .
maybe a mile and a half or so . that would be about right , would it ?
- at the wi@@ dest point .
- yeah .
and then they could actually , on a good , clear day like today , see the main@@ land across the bay .
and you recogn@@ ise that you 're on an island .
but the island was in@@ habit@@ ed by kar@@ an@@ ka@@ wa indi@@ ans .
they were hunter ga@@ ther@@ ers and they only came here during the fall .
they usually left at the end of febru@@ ary and the beginning of march and would return to the main@@ land and ...
but this was what you might call their winter residence , like the new yor@@ kers go to florida .
" we had expected to be sacrific@@ ed , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" but when the indi@@ ans saw our mis@@ ery they sat down with us and began to we@@ ep , too ,
" those un@@ civil@@ ised , sav@@ age men were sorry , for us ,
" and they shared what little food they had "
you know , you look at all these great expedit@@ ions of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors and the terrible events that happened in the new world , piz@@ ar@@ ro and everything else .
and here is a story where the man beg@@ ins here on this spot
- to become the other , doesn 't he ?
- exactly .
and it 's the indi@@ ans who give him the first clue to this transformation , isn 't it ?
they cry for him and he realis@@ es the common human@@ ity , don 't you think ?
they saw people dest@@ itu@@ te , in pain .
they were moved by com@@ passion to help them and aid them in the process and so they saved cabeza de v@@ aca , to their own de@@ tr@@ iment .
it 's ...
- they were ex@@ termin@@ ated in the end . - they were .
the kar@@ an@@ ka@@ was began to die of european dis@@ eas@@ es that same winter ,
they van@@ ished for good in the course of the 18@@ th century ,
but they kept cabeza de v@@ aca alive with the food of the island
that 's raz@@ or sharp .
so there 's an oy@@ ster bed running all the way down this little in@@ let ?
yes , and there are places out here where there are oy@@ sters for several miles and , during low ti@@ de , they 're ex@@ posed , probably at the time when they har@@ vest@@ ed them .
i don 't know how many people they were trying to feed , but i wouldn 't star@@ ve .
the expedition had been scat@@ tered to the win@@ ds ,
the men from another bar@@ ge were s@@ laugh@@ tered by indi@@ ans up the coast , one group reduc@@ ed to eating their dead ship@@ mates ,
but cabeza de v@@ aca survi@@ ved on oy@@ sters and ro@@ ots ,
this plant ...
this is a cat@@ tail .
and this is probably what he was speaking of when he said that he was breaking those nut@@ s off to eat .
it is like a nut .
extraordin@@ ary .
it was easy pick@@ ings .
they could just walk out and pick it up and there are ac@@ res and ac@@ res of oy@@ sters that are ex@@ posed at low ti@@ de .
but of the 300 men who left florida , only four would survive ,
( tan@@ n@@ 0@@ y ) please do not walk or stand in front of any vehicle while the ves@@ sel is appro@@ aching ... ( michael ) the kar@@ an@@ ka@@ was were nom@@ adi@@ c , in the spring , they crossed over to the main@@ land
and they took cabeza de v@@ aca with them ,
they had thought him a superior man , but with no skil@@ ls , he was an extra mouth to feed and he became their slave ,
he was brut@@ ally treated , but they kept him alive ,
after five or six years of that life , cabeza de v@@ aca decided he 'd had enough .
it was time to escape .
not out to sea , but into the interior .
the interior of texas at that time was completely un@@ known to the outside world
but during those years , cabeza de v@@ aca had got to know many of the nom@@ adi@@ c trib@@ es who lived in@@ land
some of them he descri@@ bes for the first time ,
co@@ ahu@@ il@@ te@@ can@@ s , ton@@ ka@@ was , at@@ akap@@ an ,
but that was not all , he 'd also discovered that one of the co@@ ast@@ al trib@@ es had shel@@ tered three other survi@@ vor@@ s of the ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k , who were still alive ,
they met up and made their break for freedom ,
their plan was to walk 1,000 miles to mexico city ,
they couldn ' t go south because of host@@ ile trib@@ es ,
so they decided to walk to the pacific , but which way ?
it used to be thought that they took a northern route through new mexico and a ri@@ zona , down into span@@ ish mexico ,
but there 's another possibil@@ ity - that they crossed the rio grande near the sea and turned west inside mexico ,
the clu@@ es are in cabeza de v@@ aca 's book , 0@@ ne of the few copi@@ es to survive is in san marcos , and there i met don 0@@ l@@ sen ,
so this is an original copy of cabeza de v@@ aca 's story ?
yes , it is .
and the page we 're most interested in , in the research we did , is page 40 .
there are four physical clu@@ es , all that happen on the same page here .
there 's a mountain of seven le@@ ag@@ ues , which would be 20 or 21 miles long .
" una sierra de si@@ eta le@@ gu@@ as . " yes .
and the stones there were like scor@@ ia of hierro .
- iron s@@ lag . - iron s@@ lag .
down near the bottom of the page , he fin@@ ds some trees .
pin@@ es with pin@@ ones .
and there again you see the pin@@ ones .
and the words that really catch our eye down there are right there .
that means their sh@@ ells were very thin .
so this is a very particular kind of pine tree .
a very particular kind .
the other two clu@@ es are much harder .
he says , " they gave us many small s@@ acks of margar@@ ita and alcohol mol@@ ido . "
now , those are miner@@ als .
people before us have trans@@ lat@@ ed that word , or trans@@ cri@@ bed it , i should say , as margar@@ ita , which can mean pear@@ ls or pearl mica , which is abun@@ dant in the deser@@ ts of arizona and new mexico and they 've used this to support the northern route .
if you look clo@@ sely , do you see what i see ? that word is not margar@@ ita .
- the second r isn 't the same as the first r .
it has a descen@@ der down to the left which prin@@ ts very fain@@ tly .
you see it there ?
if you look clo@@ sely , you see it 's actually mar@@ ga@@ x@@ ita with an x .
mar@@ ga@@ x@@ ita .
what does that mean ?
- what that means is iron py@@ rites .
- iron py@@ rites .
so the span@@ i@@ ards walked into a land rich in miner@@ als , to follow them , we crossed the rio grande and entered the des@@ ol@@ ate lands@@ cape of hor@@ th@@ ern mexico ,
, searching for cabeza de v@@ aca 's route into un@@ known america , just over there .
( read@@ s span@@ ish ) " we mar@@ ched along , mountain range seven le@@ ag@@ ues long . "
they walked the whole length of this sierra in one day .
they were the first europe@@ ans to walk across the continent ,
they gave us the first account of the people here ,
but it 's never been trac@@ ed on the ground
maybe we can ask them about the pine trees .
do you want to roll your window down ?
( speak span@@ ish )
much of his story , is still mis@@ understood because we don 't know for sure what route he took ,
we 're looking for the pin@@ ones with very , very thin sh@@ ells .
if we knew his route , then his account might begin to reve@@ al a lost history , of these lands , and now , as then , local knowledge is all ,
- the old man knows about them .
- ( they speak span@@ ish )
muchas gracias .
gracias .
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
- so the old man knew about them ?
- yeah .
fantast@@ ic .
great .
we 're on the right track .
the old her@@ der had sent us on to a dri@@ ed-@@ up river bed and there were the pine trees ,
- so this is one of them ?
- yeah .
it 's amazing to think that paper shell pin@@ on was only identi@@ fied by science in 1979 .
and how easy to imagine the span@@ i@@ ards fe@@ ast@@ ing on the ker@@ nels ,
- there 's still some on the floor .
- yeah .
it was the best food they 'd had for days ,
- this year is not ... was not a good season .
- yeah ?
when they 're still green , you just grin@@ d them up , make a ball and eat them , if they 're dry , eat them with the sh@@ ells too ,
( cr@@ un@@ ching )
you see how thin it is .
that 's what cabeza de v@@ aca 's talking about .
that 's what the indi@@ ans here used as food along with the no@@ pal cac@@ ti that we passed on the way .
but to clin@@ ch his route , we needed to find his mountain of iron ,
the loc@@ als sent us up a place called mercado , the hill of wealth , 5,000 ... more than 5,000 feet up the mountain .
cabeza de v@@ aca says the people here smel@@ ted met@@ als ,
they gave him a worked co@@ pper bell ,
there are co@@ pper deposit@@ s here and there 's also a huge quar@@ ry ,
it 's golden brown with iron ore , stre@@ wn with py@@ rites and iron s@@ lag ,
so this whole v@@ ast excav@@ ation here has been done for the iron ?
yes , they 've dug out this , made the hole .
then some rocks have fallen in from the sides .
( michael ) some of the other clu@@ es you might be able to help on , as a ge@@ olog@@ ist .
they find something , which everybody ar@@ gues over .
they call it alcohol mol@@ ido , po@@ w@@ dered alcohol , which some people say could be st@@ ib@@ n@@ ite , lead sul@@ phi@@ de .
there 's also black mang@@ an@@ ese around the outside here .
it 's called py@@ rol@@ us@@ ite .
the indi@@ ans used it as paint .
and that 's exactly what cabeza de v@@ aca says ,
" a black po@@ w@@ der used by indian women to paint their faces , "
0@@ k .
i found it .
hey , we 've got some mang@@ an@@ ese here .
fantast@@ ic .
so you think this could be it ?
well , it 's the kind of mang@@ an@@ ese we call py@@ rol@@ us@@ ite and it sure comes off black .
wow .
brilli@@ ant .
i left mon@@ clo@@ va feeling sure cabeza de v@@ aca had come this way ,
he wasn 't moving through the nom@@ adi@@ c pe@@ op@@ les of central texas ,
he was among the settled commun@@ ities here in north mexico ,
people who lived in houses , worked met@@ als and had long-@@ distance trade ,
the anc@@ est@@ ors of today 's people ,
the next few weeks , he tells us , they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry pl@@ ains into bar@@ ren mountains ,
they were heading north@@ wards now , back up towards the rio grande , but they weren 't wander@@ ing aim@@ lessly ,
they spoke the langu@@ ages and moved from one community to another on ancient tra@@ ils , which now crossed and rec@@ ros@@ sed a great river ,
these tra@@ ils are marked on us military , ma@@ ps from the 185@@ 0s , 0@@ ne of them was called the great com@@ an@@ che trail ,
going back down into mexico , it met the rio grande at the grand indian cros@@ sing ,
these tra@@ ils can be thous@@ ands of years old , maybe even used by the first migr@@ ants over 12,000 years ago ,
we took an exper@@ t guide with us , linda walker , and team arche@@ olog@@ ist bob mal@@ lou@@ f .
and all along the trail , we found places where human be@@ ings had once lived
cabeza de v@@ aca 's journey had begun to reve@@ al the van@@ ished map of ancient america ,
the shel@@ tered part and it probably ran further out .
this is one of the better pic@@ to@@ graph sites that we 've come up to .
you can see that they 're all over this pan@@ el .
( b@@ 0@@ b ) those are beautiful pic@@ to@@ grap@@ hs .
late pre@@ histor@@ ic pic@@ to@@ grap@@ hs .
- what 's late pre@@ histor@@ ic ?
- 500 ad to as late as 1550 .
0@@ n the basis of art size .
we could still make out the finger marks of the artist@@ s ,
what are they de@@ pic@@ ting ?
this looks like something with legs .
uh , it ...
they 're difficult or impossible , as a rule , to interpre@@ t ac@@ cur@@ ately , although a lot of people try . 0@@ h .
so could any of these be religi@@ ous in signific@@ ance ?
we can probably assume that they prac@@ tis@@ ed certain kin@@ ds of sh@@ aman@@ ist@@ ic religion .
certainly with heal@@ ers and this sort of thing .
this was the kind of religion that cabeza de v@@ aca and his friends en@@ counter@@ ed along this route .
and they thought cabeza de v@@ aca was a sh@@ aman .
they went to him to become heal@@ ed and they would go to him just like people would go to a medical doctor today and it 's possible that could have saved their lives .
what 's the li@@ fest@@ yle of these people ?
- well , they 're ... - ( linda ) hard .
there wouldn 't have been great hospit@@ ality at the table in the evening .
( b@@ 0@@ b ) we have hard archa@@ e@@ ological evidence that they would eat just about anything they could get their hands on .
bob 's hard evidence came from the ancient human ex@@ cre@@ ment in the rub@@ bis@@ h dum@@ ps on these camp sites ,
when cabeza de v@@ aca said they were eating wor@@ ms and spid@@ ers , he wasn 't telling lies ,
the span@@ ish gentlem@@ an was ta@@ sting the life most humans had lived since the stone age ,
that night we found a camp@@ site over@@ looking the desert , , on the great pre@@ histor@@ ic route into central america ,
the place was an abandon@@ ed indian sett@@ lement ,
we found grin@@ ding hol@@ es , just as cabeza de v@@ aca descri@@ bes ,
these are probably 2,000 ... 3,000 bc to as late as 500 ad .
see they 're very tap@@ ered ... so you have a wooden po@@ under and pound the se@@ eds or whatever you used inside .
se@@ eds , mes@@ quite be@@ ans , things like that they would ground .
they would ground up in these and po@@ w@@ der them to make meal .
- wonderful .
- these are good ex@@ amp@@ les .
cabeza de v@@ aca says these hol@@ es were used to grin@@ d mes@@ quite be@@ ans to make the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gens for the indian ceremon@@ ies ,
he also descri@@ bes the way they cook@@ ed food
( linda ) look at that .
bo@@ iling the water with hot stones from the fire ,
that is hot .
i 've never seen that done .
- 0@@ oh .
- there we go .
so they do this because they don 't have ceram@@ ics .
they don 't have ...
they can 't put a pot on the fire to heat water .
probably because they moved about frequ@@ ently .
pot@@ ter@@ y is not very condu@@ ci@@ ve to a lot of movement in this country especially , because it 's so rocky and it 's easily broken .
- so where are the te@@ ab@@ ag@@ s ?
- come on .
- english breakfast or earl grey ?
- i don 't know .
( linda ) you guys are supposed to be the exper@@ ts on this , michael .
as cabeza de v@@ aca said , " how diverse and strange are human be@@ ings and their ways , "
the four men had now reached the very , middle of the continent , but did they still feel like conquist@@ ad@@ ors ?
did cabeza de v@@ aca , the gentlem@@ an ?
he had the chance to see this world before it was destroy@@ ed by the conquist@@ ad@@ ors and exploit@@ ers who followed but how much he leaves un@@ said
( linda ) some bur@@ rit@@ os ?
( michael ) yeah , that 'd be great , thanks .
0@@ ne thing that i keep wondering about as we 're trav@@ elling in the foot@@ steps of cabeza de v@@ aca is that he 's away for seven or eight years ...
you 've got some ?
great .
... and he tells us all sor@@ ts of fascin@@ ating things about the indi@@ ans , but he never spe@@ aks about his or any of his friends ' relation@@ ships with the women .
i don 't think he would have lived that long in a nat@@ ive society without having taken on a woman and i susp@@ ect it wasn 't one that was just a shor@@ t-@@ term scenario either .
it was probably the first in@@ fusion of span@@ ish blood into america .
you can bet he wouldn 't mention it , though .
it would have caused him problems with the church probably .
he had to write this to the audience that were now fe@@ eding him , which was sp@@ ain .
and he doesn 't want them to think that he just dit@@ ched span@@ ish val@@ ues and went nat@@ ive .
and went , " these val@@ ues that i was raised with i 've now decided are susp@@ ect . "
no , i don 't think he could do that , but i con@@ cu@@ r with you .
i think there was an un@@ written story there .
and so they continued , following the sun , across the rid@@ ges of the sierra madre ,
" though we could speak six indian langu@@ ages , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " we found 1,000 differ@@ ences in their ways of spe@@ ech ,
" but we were always understood and kept our authority with the indi@@ ans ,
" though still naked , she@@ d@@ ding our skin twice a year like s@@ nak@@ es , "
( linda ) this is a ten@@ aha .
this would hold water year round .
it can be anywhere as deep as ten feet , or as shal@@ low as a foot and a half , but there 's always water there .
- ( michael ) and it 's good water ?
- good water .
( trad@@ it@@ l@@ 0@@ nal f@@ 0@@ l@@ k music pl@@ ays ) and we finally reached the little town of san carlos ,
enrique .
hi . how are you ?
good to see you .
we finally made it .
- do you want a beer ?
- i 'd love one .
( s@@ ings in span@@ ish )
- a thr@@ ill .
- y@@ up .
you know what ?
it was sure fun .
it had been fun , but it had also told us more about cabeza de v@@ aca and the man he was becoming ,
something has happened to him .
he has been trans@@ formed somehow .
he is no long either an indian and he is no longer a span@@ i@@ ard and a christian .
he is a new man .
you speak of him as a man situ@@ ated in between those two cultures .
i suppose , in a sense , he 's the first modern man , in a way .
do you think ?
learned something that very few span@@ i@@ ards knew , that the indi@@ ans were human be@@ ings .
and many in sp@@ ain didn 't want human be@@ ings at that time .
they wanted slav@@ es .
everywhere on their journey now , they were treated as people with powers , people who could he@@ al ,
to we modern people , this is the least belie@@ v@@ able part of his story ,
and even in his day , he was acc@@ used of fantas@@ ising , and worse , claim@@ ing super@@ natural powers ,
" the indian heal@@ ers do their cu@@ res like this , " he says , " by blo@@ wing on the sick person and then using their hands to cast the ill@@ ness out ,
" we did the same , but with the sign of the cross , pr@@ aying to god to make them better , " and he did
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) this is the sac@@ red heart of jesus .
he appe@@ ars to me when i cure the sick .
0@@ h , and this , this is my protection against the evil spir@@ its who can harm me .
absolutely wonderful mix@@ ture of christian symbol@@ s and yet the way of working with them is much more tradition@@ al and mexic@@ an .
it tou@@ ches back to what was the religion of the whole of the americ@@ as in ancient times , this sort of sh@@ aman@@ ist@@ ic religion .
in a sense , cabeza de v@@ aca was the first person to try and cross the bo@@ undar@@ y between the two and use them both .
" it pleased god to give them health , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , as a 16@@ th-@@ century , man would
" in the future , " he wrote to the king of sp@@ ain , " these lands will be brought to the true faith , " and though my story , may be difficult to believe , i assure your majest@@ y it is the truth , "
and however we might explain it , thous@@ ands of indi@@ ans c@@ lung to them now , asking for their bles@@ s@@ ings , walking with them through the wil@@ dern@@ ess ,
the nat@@ ives were ast@@ on@@ ished that cabeza de v@@ aca and his friends could walk for a whole day without ne@@ eding food , " but by then , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " we were so in@@ ured to suff@@ ering that we felt no fat@@ ig@@ ue . "
their gu@@ ides now led them towards another great nat@@ ive trade route across the americ@@ as - the shell trail , which came down from the pueblos of a ri@@ zona and new mexico all the way to the pacific ,
" we saw many town@@ s now , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " built by civil@@ ised people , "
they were near the ru@@ ined city of casas grandes ,
this ast@@ on@@ ishing place was once a centre of the shell trade ,
the archa@@ e@@ ologi@@ sts found a ton and a half of sh@@ ells in these ware@@ houses .
sh@@ ells for grin@@ ding up , for use as decor@@ ation on the face of the walls .
sh@@ ells for personal ador@@ n@@ ment , neck@@ lac@@ es , brac@@ el@@ ets .
sh@@ ells like the pink spon@@ dy@@ los , which was used for religi@@ ous ritu@@ als all the way along the pacific coast down to south america .
this place was abandon@@ ed a century before cabeza de v@@ aca 's day .
but the commerce and the trade routes on which it was carried still continued .
winter was coming on now as they climbed out of the pl@@ ains ,
their last hur@@ dle , the immen@@ se fis@@ su@@ red lands@@ cape around co@@ pper can@@ yon ,
0@@ ne of the big@@ gest nat@@ ive group@@ s in the americ@@ as still lives here , the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara ,
" the people here are the most open and intellig@@ ent folk i met , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" their women more modest@@ ly and better dressed than in any other part of the indi@@ es we 'd seen , "
the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara are descen@@ dents of the pe@@ op@@ les who once spread all over the high pl@@ ains of hor@@ th@@ ern mexico ,
they have bor@@ rowed from the europe@@ ans only a hand@@ ful of use@@ ful things - the viol@@ in , the go@@ at , the apple tree and the metal plo@@ ugh@@ share ,
a p@@ low ...
there are no roads through their lands , you still have to go on foot ,
they call themselves the people who walk straight , and they mean in their hearts , as well as with their feet ,
by now cabeza de v@@ aca had seen the first signs of the span@@ ish presence , an indian wearing a sword hil@@ t as an am@@ ul@@ et ,
his world was not far off ,
this is where we 'll be sleeping tonight .
and jol@@ ly com@@ fy it looks , too .
he knew now he must leave the indian world
but however much he wanted to , he also knew that what he was leaving behind had true worth ,
reading his account , i think that he remained a christian gentlem@@ an ,
he still believed in the civil@@ ising mission of sp@@ ain , but he was no longer a conquist@@ ador ,
if you had to explain to somebody what it is about this life that is so good , what would the things be that they think are so val@@ u@@ able ?
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
he had understood that the pe@@ op@@ les of the americ@@ as were human , too ,
as the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara would put it , cabeza de v@@ aca had learned to walk straight ,
he said , " what 's good about life is that there 's go@@ at shit .
" there 's go@@ at dro@@ pp@@ ings and that 's good , " because we put it on the land , so that the cor@@ n will be born to make tor@@ til@@ las with , " to make pin@@ ole with and to make tes@@ gu@@ ino with . "
i said , " why do you make tes@@ gu@@ ino ? " he says , " to have a fiesta . "
so that you can dance this special dance they do all night , so that god will bring water .
" why do you need water ? " he says , " so that the cor@@ n ... will be born . "
there 's the circle . if we kept asking , it would go round .
- fantast@@ ic .
- ( spe@@ aks tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara dial@@ ect )
( b@@ 0@@ b ) they don 't walk straight any more .
so people like me , we don 't walk straight any more ?
he says , " not hardly at all .
sorry . "
but how would cabeza de v@@ aca use his knowledge on his return ?
the od@@ ys@@ sey of cabeza de v@@ aca was drawing to its close ,
that winter they came down forest@@ ed can@@ yon@@ s towards the pacific ,
after more than 2,000 miles , he was about to re@@ enter the world he 'd once known ,
" we came down into a wonderful lands@@ cape , " he says , " fer@@ tile with ri@@ vers , forest@@ s and fields ,
" nowhere in the world , in our eyes , could be so rich and beautiful ,
( calls 0@@ ut in span@@ ish )
cabeza de v@@ aca ran into span@@ ish slave h@@ unter@@ s ,
it 's a moment which has been por@@ tr@@ ayed in nov@@ els and films ,
( y@@ elling )
and so cabeza de v@@ aca met his old self the man he 'd been all those years before ,
they threaten@@ ed to ens@@ lave his indian compan@@ ions and to kill him , but he stood his ground and forced them to let him and his indi@@ ans go ,
and finally , nearly ten years after he left cuba , he walked like a ghost into the town of cul@@ i@@ acan , to the ast@@ on@@ ishment of the local span@@ ish colon@@ ists ,
they had been the first people to walk across the continent ,
they 'd seen things no out@@ si@@ der had ever seen ,
but there 's no happy ending to his story ,
when he got back to sp@@ ain , he argu@@ ed for ben@@ evol@@ ent rule in the americ@@ as ,
but he was ru@@ ined by his enem@@ ies and he died a pau@@ per , his only leg@@ acy , the book of his advent@@ ures ,
while he 'd been lost , the world had changed as never before ,
the conquist@@ ad@@ ors had carried their s@@ words from florida to chile ,
their bra@@ very , and their gre@@ ed had led them to lake tit@@ ic@@ aca and to the he@@ ights of ma@@ chu pic@@ chu ,
and the cost ?
ancient civil@@ is@@ ations over@@ thrown ,
tens of millions dead from european violence and disease , and the pl@@ under@@ ing of the natural world of the americ@@ as ,
( m@@ 0@@ n@@ ks chant@@ ing )
back in sp@@ ain , these events woke the conscience of the age and people now began to question the justice of conqu@@ est ,
all the great civil@@ is@@ ations had treated people not of their own col@@ our or cre@@ ed as alien ,
but now , in cathol@@ ic sp@@ ain , these assum@@ p@@ tions were question@@ ed did the indi@@ ans have human rights ?
what does it mean to be human ?
in 1550 , the king 's coun@@ sell@@ ors gathered here in valladolid to listen to two great figures of the age , the dominic@@ an las casas , speaking for the indi@@ ans , and the philosoph@@ er sepul@@ veda , for the mission of imperial sp@@ ain ,
this is where the debate was held .
it 's quite a moment in the history of the world .
the first time that princip@@ les of universal human rights and global justice were worked out took place here .
sepul@@ veda conclu@@ ded by saying this - that human be@@ ings are not equ@@ al , that some are superior to others and that the in@@ habitants of the new world were natural slav@@ es because they were barbar@@ ous and in@@ hum@@ ane .
" how can it be doub@@ ted that they have been just@@ ly con@@ quer@@ ed " by our most hum@@ ane nation , which excel@@ s in every kind of vir@@ tue ? "
las casas spoke second .
stag@@ ger@@ ed in , an enor@@ mous pile of docum@@ entation , 40 years of research .
the king 's coun@@ sell@@ ors ' ja@@ ws must have dropped .
must have thought he was going to talk for days and he did .
he talked for five days .
and the nu@@ b of his argument was this - that the con@@ quest@@ s in the new world were wrong and had to be stopped , that the only way was pe@@ ace@@ ful conversion through love and kind@@ ness .
" there 's no nation on earth , " he said , " no matter how sav@@ age , can@@ not at@@ tain hum@@ ane civil@@ isation .
" all the pe@@ op@@ les of the world are human be@@ ings .
" and the definition of a human being " is that we are all ration@@ al things .
" we share the same fac@@ ulti@@ es of will and capac@@ ities and understanding .
" we all take pleasure in good@@ ness .
" the war against the nat@@ ives of the new world is wrong " because it is un@@ just to w@@ age war against our fellow humans .
" and all the pe@@ op@@ les of the world are human . "
( bell rings )
the king listened he ordered a stop to the con@@ quest@@ s while the issue was debat@@ ed further ,
but he couldn ' t stop history , 0@@ n the ground , the con@@ quest@@ s continued , dri@@ ven , as ever , by the lust for gold
and what of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors themselves , the men who won the new world
what did they think , looking back ?
he died in ...
stuart ster@@ ling 's anc@@ est@@ or was one of them ,
he fought in the batt@@ les in peru , saw at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa dead , married an in@@ ca princess , but he had blood on his hands ,
he wrote this extraordin@@ ary document , which he ad@@ dressed to king philip ii .
0@@ n his death@@ bed , aged 78 , he ad@@ dressed to the king a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le confes@@ sion ,
" i , captain man@@ cio se@@ ir@@ ra de le@@ gu@@ iz@@ amo , make this my last will and testament .
" fir@@ st@@ ly , for the peace of my soul , i declare for many years now " i have wanted to speak to his cathol@@ ic majest@@ y , to king philip .
" i wish your majest@@ y to understand the motive that moves me to say this
" is the peace of my conscience , because of the guilt i share .
" for we have destroy@@ ed , by our evil de@@ eds , such a government as was enjoyed by these nat@@ ives " and now they have come to such a pass that these nat@@ ives , from doing no evil , " have changed to people who now do no good .
" and so i have un@@ bur@@ den@@ ed my conscience .
" there is nothing more i can do to alle@@ vi@@ ate these in@@ just@@ ices , other than by these words ,
" for i 'm the last to die of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors . "
in the winter of 1527 , a boat arrived at a lonely island off the pacific shore of south america ,
it had come to res@@ cue a rag@@ ged band of desper@@ ado@@ es who 'd been searching the un@@ known for lands of gold
their leader was an old conquist@@ ador called francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro still belie@@ ves that somewhere to the south there 's an un@@ discovered world .
but his men now have had enough of his prom@@ ises .
they just want to get out .
" he 's a but@@ cher , a sav@@ age !
get us off this hell@@ ish beach ! "
then piz@@ ar@@ ro gets up and he takes his sword and ... dra@@ ws a line in the sand .
" friends and com@@ ra@@ des , " he said , " this side of the line is danger , death , hunger , abandon@@ ment .
" this side of the line , comfort and safety .
" that side of the line , go back to panama and you 'll be poor .
" cross over this side and you 'll be rich beyond your wil@@ dest dreams . "
13 of them cross over - the glor@@ ious 13 , they called them .
they would particip@@ ate in one of the most amazing events in history - the conqu@@ est of an empire which until that moment was un@@ known to the whole world , the empire of the inc@@ as .
un@@ like the europe@@ ans , the inc@@ as still lived in sac@@ red time ,
for them , the sun was god and every , day they wor@@ shi@@ pped his first appearance from the bitter an@@ dean night ,
" and we thought this was the whole world , " said one of them ,
" for we knew of ho other , "
until the span@@ ish came ,
in 15@@ 32 , piz@@ ar@@ ro returned to peru with a small private army ,
with him were the survi@@ vor@@ s from his island , his hom@@ et@@ own friends and four of his brothers , as clo@@ se-@@ kn@@ it as a mafia clan ,
ahead of them lay a v@@ ast empire and the great in@@ ca himself at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
in november 15@@ 33 , after months of tre@@ k@@ king south ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro reached the foot of the andes ,
we set out to follow in his foot@@ steps ,
( he gre@@ ets her in span@@ ish )
at first , the local people fed the strang@@ ers ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro himself slept in their houses ,
i 'll be reason@@ ably comfortable !
i shouldn 't have imagined a mat@@ t@@ ress .
he taught span@@ ish to two indi@@ ans so he could conver@@ se in que@@ chua , the in@@ ca language ,
the span@@ ish gathered their first impres@@ sions of this great state and its people ,
" how ration@@ al the indi@@ ans are , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary ,
" the people seem very , obe@@ dient to their rul@@ ers , "
here , the span@@ i@@ ards ta@@ sted po@@ tat@@ o@@ es for the first time ,
along with more ex@@ otic dis@@ hes@@ l
there 's an old story that in ancient in@@ ca times , there was a period of fam@@ ine .
the people were star@@ ving .
they discovered this fur@@ ry ro@@ dent among the rocks .
it was good to eat and it saved them .
they only eat it for special festivals - religi@@ ous festivals and so on .
they 're doing it today because they 've got a foreign guest .
next day , we lo@@ aded up to follow piz@@ ar@@ ro into the andes ,
it 's an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able thought - piz@@ ar@@ ro had 62 horse and 102 foot plus some nat@@ ive allies from further up the coast .
he 's enter@@ ing an empire of five or ten million !
maybe if he knew , he would go back !
he hadn 't seen the in@@ ca army , had he ?
amazing .
amazing .
he 's a can@@ ny character , piz@@ ar@@ ro .
il@@ liter@@ ate , midd@@ le-@@ aged , tou@@ gh as old boots .
and very , very cle@@ ver .
he understood that the inc@@ as were a civil@@ isation that , for all its wonder@@ s , would be at the level of the bronze age and that with guns and toledo s@@ words he could strike where it really hurt .
the roads of the in@@ ca empire stretched 3,000 miles , from chile to ecuador ,
and this one led to the camp of the in@@ ca himself at the town of ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
" we followed a narrow ste@@ ep path , " the span@@ ish said , " straight up to the mountain pe@@ aks , "
it 's still there , with its in@@ ca steps ,
look at this !
is this in@@ ca , ricardo ?
nobody but the inc@@ as made this kind of work .
look .
i 've got the account of piz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary of their journey up this pass . he says how ste@@ ep the pass was .
when they got to the top , it was defen@@ ded by a fort@@ ress surrounded by stone walls , built on a hill with very ste@@ ep rocks on either side .
that 's it !
we 're on his tracks !
- almost nobody knows this place in peru .
- really ?
it 's amazing .
the span@@ i@@ ards were seeing things no out@@ si@@ der had ever seen ,
the last moments of a world un@@ touched since the dawn of history ,
after five days ' march over the mountains ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro came out above the town of ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
the camp@@ fi@@ res of the enemy that night were a terri@@ f@@ ying sight , the span@@ ish said .
" like a brilli@@ antly star@@ -@@ stud@@ ded sky . "
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's army , they rec@@ kon@@ ed , was 30,000 strong ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were on edge now ,
why had they been allowed to come on un@@ op@@ posed
were they walking into a trap ?
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary , tells the tale ,
" few of us slept that night .
we just talked about what we should do .
" all were full of fear , for we were so few , and so deep into the land .
" and with no hope of res@@ cue . "
the in@@ ca , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa , was taking the waters at the hot springs outside the town , and it was here that the two worl@@ ds first met ,
the span@@ ish advan@@ ce party told a tah@@ u@@ al@@ pa that piz@@ ar@@ ro loved him de@@ arly and would fight for him against his enem@@ ies ,
" and he smiled , " said the span@@ ish ,
" as if he didn ' t think much of us , "
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa told them they could stay in the town ,
0@@ min@@ ously , when the span@@ ish entered the town , they found it empty ,
they occu@@ pied a building on the square and waited to see what the in@@ ca would do ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's sp@@ ies had been watching them all the way ,
his chief sp@@ y , apu , repor@@ ted back ,
we know , from several chron@@ ic@@ lers , what apu repor@@ ted .
he repor@@ ted to his boss the following .
- 0@@ ne , they are not gods .
- not gods ?
- the in@@ ca knew that .
- doesn 't mean the people knew that .
0@@ k ? " i have seen them , " said apu , " i have seen how they get tired . "
0@@ r sick . and a few of them died .
gods don 't die .
they don 't get sick .
but they decided a plan .
they said let 's kill them all except three of them , who are going to be ca@@ str@@ ated .
the hor@@ se-@@ break@@ er ,
- the iron man ...
- the black@@ smith ?
the guy who does the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es and the weap@@ on@@ ry .
and the bar@@ ber .
the hor@@ se-@@ break@@ er and the other one , of course , to estab@@ lis@@ h the caval@@ ry of at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa .
but the bar@@ ber because , apu said , " he knows something .
he has powers .
" i have seen the people lin@@ ing up in front of his tent .
" they 're tired , really mes@@ sed up .
" and when they come out , i have seen them re@@ juven@@ ated , " fresh , health , " and with their skin fresh as a baby 's but@@ t . "
yeah !
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa wanted to have piz@@ ar@@ ro for lunch .
but piz@@ ar@@ ro had him for breakfast !
down in the square , as the hours passed , the span@@ ish still waited
" and i tell you , " said one of them , " we were wet@@ ting our@@ selves in terror , "
at last , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa entered the square on the shoulders of his cour@@ tiers ,
he was around 30 , handsome and intellig@@ ent , the red royal tas@@ sel on his forehead and a sil@@ ky soft clo@@ ak made of the s@@ kins of vampire bat@@ s ,
it 's funny what people remember at such moments of high tension ,
the span@@ ish remembered the lil@@ ting song with which the people wel@@ com@@ ed him ,
it 's still sung today at festivals in the andes ,
( rhyth@@ mic chant )
piz@@ ar@@ ro watched with his cap@@ tains and his priest , val@@ verde ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa took his seat in the middle of the square ,
val@@ verde stepped forward with a cross and a pr@@ ayer book and made a spe@@ ech about christ and the po@@ pe .
he called upon the in@@ ca to abandon his fal@@ se religion and embr@@ ace christ .
" i follow my religion , " said at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa .
" the und@@ ying sun and the ancient gods of the inc@@ as .
" what is your authority for your religion ? " he said .
the priest held up his book .
" give it to me , " said at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
" so i may see if it spe@@ aks to me . "
he turned the pages carefully and then looked up .
" why does it say nothing to me ? " he said , and he threw the book on the floor .
that was what piz@@ ar@@ ro had been waiting for .
it was the moment on which his whole career had conver@@ ged .
it gave him his pre@@ text for war and he gave the order to attack .
from the por@@ ticos all around this square the span@@ ish came out and opened fire on the mas@@ ses of people crow@@ ded here .
in@@ ca st@@ icks and fans were no match for span@@ ish guns and steel ,
some said 6,000 people died that night ,
as the rain fell , the square ran red with blood
but at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa was cap@@ tured alive ,
they took him in ch@@ ains to a prison clo@@ se-@@ by ,
it 's still there ,
and now at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa made an ast@@ on@@ ishing offer - to ran@@ som himself
if they would set him free , he would fill the room with gold
0@@ n his desert island , had p iz@@ ar@@ ro ever imagined this ?
in his wil@@ dest dreams ? the story 's still told and re@@ told across the andes ,
but there are other in@@ ca versions of the story , 0@@ ne of them a unique manus@@ cript discovered only in the 20@@ th century ,
( man ) thank you very much .
this is it , the famous " nueva cron@@ ica y buen gobierno . "
it 's really excit@@ ing to be facing this document , a document which is unique .
because here , you not only see things that are val@@ u@@ able for the past , but also things that will help you to understand the present .
the auth@@ or , gu@@ aman p@@ oma , was a man of in@@ ca des@@ cent ,
( 0@@ ss@@ l@@ 0 ) this is the point of view of a van@@ qu@@ ished .
0@@ f one of those indi@@ ans who were con@@ quer@@ ed by the span@@ ish people .
he 's always insisted that the real o@@ wn@@ ers of the indian territor@@ ies are the indi@@ ans and the span@@ i@@ ards are the o@@ wn@@ ers of sp@@ ain .
and each one in their own real@@ m is perfect .
0@@ r@@ der is perfect .
but if the span@@ ish come here and pretend to be the o@@ wn@@ ers , then that is represent@@ ing the dis@@ order of the world .
the world is up@@ side down .
- ( w@@ 00@@ d ) the world is up@@ side down ?
- yeah .
to ga@@ ther the gold , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ordered his people to allow the span@@ ish to travel fre@@ ely through his empire ,
and the span@@ i@@ ards set out on the greatest pl@@ under@@ ing raid in history ,
so why did a tah@@ u@@ al@@ pa do it ?
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , the in@@ ca had never seen the strang@@ ers as a threat , now , he thought , if he deli@@ vered the gold as promised ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro would simply go away ,
" at that time , " says gu@@ aman p@@ oma , " we indi@@ ans lost all sense of direction , we forgot our gods " and lost the authority of our rul@@ ers , "
so piz@@ ar@@ ro 's men stri@@ pped the gold off the greatest shr@@ ines in the americ@@ as ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa filled his ran@@ som room with seven ton@@ nes of it , one of the greatest tre@@ as@@ ures in all of history ,
he 'd kept his word but what would p iz@@ ar@@ ro do ?
piz@@ ar@@ ro put at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa on tri@@ al for tre@@ ason , the jury , - the piz@@ ar@@ ro brothers and their friends ,
the ver@@ dic@@ t - " the in@@ ca must die , "
" it was the most desp@@ ic@@ able thing we ever did in the americ@@ as , " said one conquist@@ ador ,
in the andes , the people have never forgotten ,
( he spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
corazon ?
the heart of a p@@ uma , si ?
they killed him like a llama .
for the inc@@ as , these events were almost beyond belief
this was a " pach@@ ac@@ uti " - the world turned up@@ side down ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro now mar@@ ched his army in trium@@ ph south , on the in@@ ca royal road , a thousand miles to the capital of the in@@ ca empire , cu@@ z@@ co ,
" 0@@ n november 15@@ th , 15@@ 33 ,
" we span@@ i@@ ards reached cu@@ z@@ co ,
" it was a won@@ dro@@ us thing to be@@ hold
" no prize ever equ@@ al@@ led this ,
" the streets were grand , " the pal@@ aces of fin@@ el@@ y-@@ join@@ ted stone blo@@ cks of great anti@@ qu@@ ity , "
it was the rich@@ est town in all the indi@@ es , fo@@ unded by the first in@@ ca and re@@ fo@@ unded in 15@@ 33 by francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
and so , at last , piz@@ ar@@ ro looked down on his prize ,
the city of the inc@@ as , with its great ceremon@@ ial square and the huge pal@@ aces of the in@@ ca royal clan@@ s ,
it was a turning point in the history , of the world
the in@@ ca believed this place was the nav@@ el of the earth .
it was the sac@@ red centre of the last of the civil@@ is@@ ations to ar@@ ise indepen@@ d@@ ently on the planet .
and the fall of the city to the span@@ ish , coming so soon after the fall of mexico , seems now like the beginning of the end for the tradition@@ al civil@@ is@@ ations of the world .
the end of sac@@ red time .
the trium@@ ph of pro@@ fan@@ e time .
for piz@@ ar@@ ro 's expedition was a profit - making vent@@ ure backed by the bank@@ ers of europe ,
from now on , across the atlantic , the talk was of ho@@ thing but peru and gold
europe was amaz@@ ed span@@ i@@ ards flo@@ o@@ ded into peru on a gold rush ,
the piz@@ ar@@ ro brothers fla@@ un@@ ted their new@@ -@@ found fortun@@ es ,
for them , these were days of wonder as they tightened their grip on the people and the riches of p er@@ u ,
to win hearts and min@@ ds , the piz@@ ar@@ ros ap@@ pointed a pu@@ pp@@ et king , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's half-@@ brother man@@ co ,
but the span@@ i@@ ards treated him with con@@ tempt ,
to the inc@@ as ' horror , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro rap@@ ed man@@ co 's wife and took her for himself
word soon spread of a war of liberation ,
man@@ co sum@@ mon@@ ed his lead@@ ers to a secret meeting ,
perhaps it took place in the in@@ ca sun temple which still stands today inside a cu@@ z@@ co church ,
man@@ co 's words were recor@@ ded by his son tito c@@ usi ,
" i 've sum@@ mon@@ ed you all here , " said man@@ co , " because we all know now clearly who these fore@@ ign@@ ers really are .
" they 're not wor@@ thy people sent by god , " but children of the devil .
" we 've endu@@ red a thousand insul@@ ts , they treat us like dogs " while swe@@ aring to be our friends .
" now i want you to send your mes@@ sen@@ gers thro@@ ugh@@ out the whole country .
" sum@@ mon all your forces to ga@@ ther here in cu@@ z@@ co in 20 days ' time " to attack them .
" make sure the bear@@ ded ones hear nothing about this " and we 'll kill every last one of them .
" then , perhaps , we may wak@@ en from this nightmare . "
man@@ co 's plan was a concer@@ ted attack all over peru , above cu@@ z@@ co , a v@@ ast in@@ ca army gathered in the hills ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were surrounded cut off in lima , francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro sent fran@@ tic ple@@ as to mexico for help ,
three relief colum@@ ns were wiped out by man@@ co 's ar@@ mi@@ es , here in cu@@ z@@ co ,
span@@ ish surviv@@ al hung on whether they could take the in@@ ca fort@@ ress which control@@ led the city at sac@@ say@@ hu@@ aman ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were out@@ num@@ ber@@ ed and , at times , out@@ fought ,
juan piz@@ ar@@ ro was killed but in the end , the inc@@ as were out@@ gun@@ ned
the last battle for these walls was fought with a desperate hero@@ ism by the in@@ ca warriors .
like the az@@ tec battle for mexico city , it re@@ calls the great class@@ ical ep@@ ics like the " ili@@ ad , " the siege of troy .
the last of the great in@@ ca heroes , they say , stood on top of these rocks ar@@ med with a european sword , throwing the span@@ ish off , killing members of his own side if they thought of sur@@ ren@@ dering to the span@@ i@@ ards .
in the end , when it was clearly all ho@@ pel@@ ess , he threw his weapons down , stu@@ ffed his mouth with earth , s@@ cour@@ ged his face and threw himself off the rocks in ful@@ fil@@ ment of his vo@@ w that he would die rather than give in to the span@@ ish .
" and so our en@@ cir@@ clement was broken , " says gu@@ aman p@@ oma ,
" the span@@ i@@ ards had bought themselves a breathing space , "
the piz@@ ar@@ ros now took sav@@ age repr@@ is@@ als against the ci@@ vili@@ an population , the women and children who helped man@@ co 's army ,
a massive exo@@ dus followed as those who could f@@ led north into the sac@@ red valley ,
the sac@@ red valley was the in@@ ca heart@@ land
here they built their fin@@ est pal@@ aces with huge ter@@ rac@@ es to grow ma@@ ize and co@@ ca leaves ,
here , man@@ co and his high priest could call on the help of the anc@@ est@@ ors ,
at ma@@ chu pic@@ chu , the mum@@ mi@@ es of the dead inc@@ as could be brought out of their wom@@ b-@@ like cham@@ bers to gre@@ et the sun ,
their dead eyes reg@@ aled as in life with the vi@@ stas of the sac@@ red pe@@ aks ,
- ~ buenos dias !
- ~ buenos dias !
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , man@@ co built new ter@@ rac@@ es and houses here to feed and shel@@ ter the influ@@ x of tro@@ ops and refu@@ gees ,
you can still see them at 0@@ l@@ lant@@ ay@@ t@@ ambo , with its in@@ ca ho@@ using plo@@ ts and water chann@@ els ,
the inc@@ as bo@@ ast@@ ed that man@@ co had made this the strong@@ est fort@@ ress in all peru ,
and it was here that the piz@@ ar@@ ros laun@@ ched their next attack ,
they fought their way through the narrow lan@@ es of the town ,
then they att@@ acked the fort@@ ress which to@@ wers above ,
the span@@ i@@ ards now sent their force of command@@ os up to try and seize the rocks above the fort@@ ress .
her@@ n@@ ando piz@@ ar@@ ro led the as@@ sault up these steps while the inc@@ as rain@@ ed down mis@@ siles , spur@@ red on by man@@ co , who rode the ter@@ rac@@ es above on a span@@ ish horse ,
" suddenly , the indi@@ ans hit us from every , side ,
" to hear the ro@@ ar of their army ,
" it was as if the mountain was about to crash on top of us , "
for the first time , the span@@ ish had been be@@ aten in a pit@@ ched battle ,
" 0@@ ne more day and we would have killed them all , " said tito c@@ usi ,
" my father 's men laughed heart@@ ily at the span@@ ish ro@@ ut " and how we celebr@@ ated our victory , "
man@@ co planned to make a new cu@@ z@@ co here in the sac@@ red valley ,
he even built a great council chamber , car@@ ved with the royal pum@@ as ,
" by such monuments , he hoped to be remembered always , " said gu@@ aman p@@ oma ,
but man@@ co knew that span@@ ish colon@@ ists were pour@@ ing into peru every , month ,
within a year , man@@ co realis@@ ed he would have to pull right out of span@@ ish reach , to the jung@@ les the far side of the andes ,
peru would be partit@@ ion@@ ed
it must have been a heart@@ breaking moment for the young in@@ ca ,
when man@@ co had decided to re@@ treat up the valley into the jung@@ les of vil@@ cab@@ amba he made a spe@@ ech to his lo@@ yal fol@@ lo@@ wers .
a moving spe@@ ech , too , a little like bon@@ nie prince charlie going over the sea to sk@@ ye .
he asked them to remember his anc@@ est@@ ors , the inc@@ as of the past , had been good rul@@ ers , had cared for the people and provi@@ ded for them .
" don 't forget that , " he said .
" don 't let your children forget it . "
then he said these extraordin@@ ary words which are all the more strik@@ ing now .
" i know , " he said , " that one day , in the future , " the time will come when they will force us to wor@@ ship their gods .
" and when that day comes , " do what you have to do in front of them , but in private don 't forget our ceremon@@ ies " and our gods .
" and if they try to force you to destroy our shr@@ ines , " only reve@@ al what you have to and keep the rest hidden in your hearts . "
so the in@@ ca empire was to be divi@@ ded
man@@ co 's court and his army began their long march over the andes , demol@@ ishing the road behind them as they went , nearly 13@@ ,000 feet .
good lord !
no wonder my hands are fre@@ ez@@ ing cold !
but even now , the inc@@ as still dre@@ amed that one day they might return ,
0@@ n the far side of the mountains , man@@ co hoped to organise a new resistance , as man@@ co put it , " to free the land of our fore@@ fa@@ thers , "
man@@ co destroy@@ ed the rope bridge here , the river was to be the bo@@ undar@@ y , between the two worl@@ ds ,
but no one crossed the piz@@ ar@@ ros ,
gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro now prepared to hunt man@@ co down , man@@ co 's line of re@@ treat had led him to a remo@@ te jungle hide@@ away at vil@@ cab@@ amba , the lost city of the inc@@ as ,
with him , gonz@@ alo took 300 of the tou@@ gh@@ est conquist@@ ad@@ ors , more than his brother had led to ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
we set out to follow him ,
i 've now got fle@@ as . you may wonder why i 'm scrat@@ ching my hands .
i 've been bit@@ ten by the dre@@ aded " p@@ uma w@@ ac@@ achi " - which is the fly that makes even the p@@ uma cry !
- it 's got me all over . it 's true !
- p@@ uma w@@ ac@@ achi !
me w@@ ac@@ achi !
the first stage of our tre@@ k in piz@@ ar@@ ro 's foot@@ steps took us across ble@@ ak u@@ pl@@ ands over the last of the high passes towards amaz@@ onia ,
man@@ co had reti@@ red to the far@@ th@@ est corner of the in@@ ca world to cre@@ ate his new kingdom ,
( men enc@@ 0@@ ur@@ age h@@ 0@@ r@@ ses )
- is this the pass col@@ pa ?
- yes , this is col@@ pa pasa .
- the col@@ pa pasa ?
- yes .
- what does that mean ?
- that 's the high@@ est point on the trail .
i 'll catch you up in a minute .
the col@@ pa pass , the high pass .
about 12,@@ 400 feet .
this is the last of the passes before the road goes down and down and down towards the head@@ waters of the amazon and down into amaz@@ onia itself .
when the in@@ ca resistance headed this way , they were saying goodbye to their old hom@@ eland .
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , man@@ co had pushed new roads into the interior , and on the second day , we found them ,
- this looks like in@@ ca steps , yeah ?
- yes , it is in@@ ca steps .
they 're quite well pre@@ served up here .
yeah .
piz@@ ar@@ ro now s@@ cent@@ ed blood
" we can@@ not fa@@ il to get man@@ co now , " he said , " dead or alive , "
but piz@@ ar@@ ro was too confid@@ ent and he fell into man@@ co 's trap ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
don juven@@ al told us how the inc@@ as had rolled stones down on the span@@ i@@ ards ,
there are still pil@@ es of rocks up there ,
36 conquist@@ ad@@ ors were killed
gonz@@ alo was forced to re@@ treat and wait for rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements before he dar@@ ed push on ,
and man@@ co taun@@ ted him ,
" i am man@@ co in@@ ca ,
" we have killed 2,000 span@@ i@@ ards and we will kill you too , and free our country , "
the following day , we came down through the clouds into so@@ d@@ den rain@@ forest@@ s ,
in places , land@@ sli@@ des had taken the path away ,
such conditions must have s@@ apped the mor@@ ale even of p iz@@ ar@@ ro 's har@@ den@@ ed conquist@@ ad@@ ors ,
we came in sight of man@@ co 's lost city ,
- this is espiritu p@@ ampa ?
- espiritu p@@ ampa .
si .
there it is , the lost valley of the inc@@ as .
the site of their last city .
it 's so sec@@ lu@@ ded , so hidden , you can understand why it was never discovered until the 20@@ th century .
you can understand too why the last of the inc@@ as thought they might be safe here , hidden away from the rest of the world .
piz@@ ar@@ ro had had to fight his way this far , but when he got here , the city was empty ,
man@@ co had disappeared into the jungle ,
this is la plaza principal , don juven@@ al ?
si , plaza principal .
( d@@ 0@@ n juven@@ al spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
today , man@@ co 's city lies scat@@ tered over a square mile of forest , so chok@@ ed with veget@@ ation it takes time to make out the sha@@ pes of the buildings ,
it 's all on such a huge scale .
this is the ter@@ racing of the great plaza in the middle of the city on which stood the temple .
they brought all their most sac@@ red rel@@ ics here from cu@@ z@@ co - the mum@@ mi@@ es of the last of the dead inc@@ as , and above all the most sac@@ red reli@@ c , the golden image that symbol@@ ised the rising sun in whose chest was a heart made of dou@@ gh
they brought it all here to try to re@@ build their world in the jungle .
gonz@@ alo search@@ ed these forest@@ s for two months till s@@ ick@@ ness and star@@ v@@ ation forced him to re@@ treat ,
by his finger@@ nails , man@@ co had survi@@ ved
in his fury piz@@ ar@@ ro took reven@@ ge ,
he ordered man@@ co 's wife shot with arro@@ ws and flo@@ ated her down the river in a basket to be found by the inc@@ as ,
man@@ co was gri@@ ef@@ -@@ stric@@ ken for he had loved her very , much ,
mean@@ while , piz@@ ar@@ ro 's private empire began to fall apart ,
like all mafia famili@@ es , the piz@@ ar@@ ros had made bitter enem@@ ies ,
in a scene from " the god@@ father , " francisco , the disco@@ ver@@ er and con@@ quer@@ or of p er@@ u , was mur@@ dered by the son of his first business partner ,
man@@ co , mean@@ while , had made his new capital at a place called vit@@ cos ,
fantast@@ ic !
there 's the vil@@ cab@@ amba river .
the span@@ ish descri@@ bed the place as being on a high mountain with wonderful views over the province of vil@@ cab@@ amba .
0@@ n top , they say , was a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al flat area where majest@@ ic and sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous buildings had been erec@@ ted with great s@@ kill and art .
you can see their ru@@ ins even from this distance .
man@@ co held court here for seven years ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were now fighting among themselves and he shel@@ tered enem@@ ies of the piz@@ ar@@ ros ,
but there was a price on the in@@ ca 's head , and in the end they got him ,
this is all that re@@ mains of man@@ co 's palace .
here 's the fin@@ el@@ y-@@ sculp@@ ted lin@@ tels that the span@@ i@@ ards mentioned .
and here 's the plaza where it all happened .
man@@ co was about to play a game of qu@@ o@@ its with hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es with his span@@ ish gu@@ ests , a game he liked .
his son tito c@@ usi tells the story .
" my father was about to throw , " he said , " when one of the span@@ i@@ ards stab@@ bed him in the back .
" he tried to defend himself , but there were seven of them and he was un@@ ar@@ med .
" they stab@@ bed him and stab@@ bed him .
i wanted to defend him , " tito says , " but i was only nine years old .
" they turned on me and i was terri@@ fied and ran off into the bus@@ hes .
" though i was wo@@ unded in the leg , i escaped .
" but my father was killed . "
man@@ co had been the one in@@ ca who offered hope of long-@@ term resistance .
so the in@@ ca empire ended .
the polit@@ ical order was destroy@@ ed .
but things ex@@ ist at different level@@ s in history .
and em@@ pi@@ res are really just on the surface of history .
below them is a much deeper structure that last@@ s much longer - the long-@@ last@@ ing , ten@@ ac@@ ious , de@@ ep@@ -@@ ro@@ ot@@ ed culture of the people of a region , sha@@ ped by their lands@@ cape and clim@@ ate .
up here in the andes , the in@@ ca people survive and the belie@@ fs survive , just as man@@ co in@@ ca had said .
the people themselves did not forget .
nearly 500 years on , the people of the andes still rever@@ e the anc@@ estr@@ al spir@@ its of the inc@@ as ,
every june , they go up in their thous@@ ands onto the glac@@ iers of the sac@@ red mountains ,
just before dawn , at a breath@@ less 16@@ ,000 feet , they wor@@ ship the ice of q@@ oy@@ l@@ l@@ ur rit@@ i , the lord of the snow star ,
and after@@ wards , like their in@@ ca anc@@ est@@ ors , the people gre@@ et the rising sun ,
and then they sing the lil@@ ting song they sang to at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa all those years ago ,
" when the last in@@ ca is dead , " said old francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro , " the people will we@@ ary , of resistance " and take our part , "
" in the beginning , " said the az@@ tec@@ s , " the white men came in one boat , "
nearly 500 years ago ,
span@@ ish advent@@ ur@@ ers landed on a small island off the coast of mexico ,
it was the first contact between the civil@@ is@@ ations of the old world and the new ,
the pre@@ lu@@ de to one of the greatest events in history ,
it 's a story of almost incredi@@ ble en@@ dur@@ ance , hero@@ ism , gre@@ ed and brut@@ ality .
and all the more po@@ ignant today as we see its long-@@ term effec@@ ts un@@ fol@@ ding across the globe .
it 's known still in the americ@@ as as the conqu@@ est , the " conquista . "
and the lar@@ ger@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ life men who ach@@ ie@@ ved it are the con@@ quer@@ ors , the " conquist@@ ad@@ ors . "
" most migh@@ ty prince , " wrote her@@ nan cortes to the king of sp@@ ain ,
" let me begin at the beginning , we sa@@ iled our ships to the land called yuc@@ atan , "
cortes was a poor boy from a small town , train@@ ed in law , not war , but he had dreams ,
a self-@@ made man , he 'd finan@@ ced his own expedition - 11 ships , 500 soldiers ,
like colum@@ bus , he didn ' t know what lay ahead
he thought the land they could see beyond cuba was just islands , through which they could sa@@ il to china ,
it was april 1519 ,
gracias !
it 's hard for us to imagine the shock of the new for people of the 16@@ th century ,
for us , it would be like landing on another planet ,
to disco@@ ver that the new world also had great civil@@ is@@ ations , with law , writing and architecture , this was a revel@@ ation ,
" what ration@@ al be@@ ings live here ? " wrote cortes ,
" this is the best and rich@@ est land that ever there was , "
the a@@ we@@ -@@ struck conquist@@ ad@@ ors christ@@ ened one place " el gran ca@@ iro , "
cortes headed west to the tab@@ asco river , the fron@@ tier of the mayan and the az@@ tec@@ -@@ speaking worl@@ ds ,
still perhaps un@@ sure of his next move , he landed in frontera ,
the key to any close en@@ counter is language , but cortes couldn ' t talk to the az@@ tec@@ s ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
he 'd already found a span@@ ish sail@@ or who spoke mayan ,
then , here in frontera , he had his lucky break ,
cortes was given a slave girl by a local chief her name was mal@@ in@@ ali , but here in mexico everyone calls her " mal@@ in@@ che , "
mal@@ in@@ che spoke mayan and nah@@ u@@ at@@ l , the az@@ tec language , through her , he could talk to them ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) mal@@ in@@ che was treated well by the span@@ ish .
especially by cortes .
some say she fell ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly in love with him .
- afro@@ disi@@ aco , # si ?
- si .
yes , some say she was daz@@ z@@ led by the power of cortes .
and how she 's paid for it@@ l " trait@@ or , wh@@ ore , god@@ dess of death , "
for nearly 500 years , mexic@@ ans have argu@@ ed about mal@@ in@@ che and her relationship with cortes , but mal@@ in@@ che was the one who would lead cortes to his destiny ,
cortes sa@@ ils on up the coast , mal@@ in@@ che at his side ,
he ke@@ eps asking about gold and everywhere they tell him of a myster@@ ious empire in the interior ,
a land called mexico ,
he anch@@ ors at an island off the coast , " the isle of sacrific@@ es , " , just off the modern port of vera cruz ,
and it was here that cortes had his first en@@ counter with the az@@ tec@@ s ,
in his letters , you can still feel his sense of wonder ,
since then , the tale has become a my@@ th , it 's even im@@ mortal@@ ised in the movies ,
0@@ n e@@ aster saturday 1519 , a magn@@ ific@@ ent em@@ bas@@ sy arrived from the r@@ uler of mexico ,
even more strange , they seemed to have been expecting cortes ,
dona marina , find out who hon@@ ours us in this royal manner .
yes , my lord .
( they speak nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
mal@@ in@@ che trans@@ lat@@ es their nah@@ u@@ at@@ l ,
tell the royal amb@@ ass@@ ador i am pleased to welcome him to my camp .
to his amaz@@ ement , the az@@ tec@@ s offer him wonderful gif@@ ts of gold
though cortes was preten@@ ding to be the amb@@ ass@@ ador of a great king , he couldn 't respond in kind and as gif@@ ts to the az@@ tec@@ s , he scrap@@ ed up a chair , some trin@@ kets and a velvet cap which their amb@@ ass@@ ador accepted , though he looked at them as if they were ex@@ cre@@ ment !
then came the cru@@ cial moment in the conversation .
" do you have more gold ? " says cortes .
" because we suff@@ er from a disease of the heart that can only be cu@@ red by gold . "
" yes , we do , " said the amb@@ ass@@ ador .
there could hardly have been a more dangerous ad@@ mission .
cortes now gave the az@@ tec@@ s a show of his power ,
he fired his guns , rode his horses down the shore ,
the az@@ tec@@ s were stun@@ ned they 'd never seen such things before ,
their amb@@ ass@@ ador had his artist@@ s paint them , as we would take photo@@ grap@@ hs ,
" the strang@@ ers , " he said , " have st@@ icks which spur@@ t fire ,
" they ride de@@ er , high as a house , which snor@@ t and fo@@ am , "
cortes was invit@@ ed to make a camp , he built a base here at villa rica ,
you can see it all from here .
the little bay , the little head@@ land where they built their fort .
tiny , isn 't it ? just a first en@@ clave in the new world .
but it all started from here .
and perhaps it was only now that cortes dre@@ amed up the plan to go to the city of the az@@ tec@@ s ,
could he somehow get them to bow to sp@@ ain ?
those nights by the sea , the loc@@ als told him of what lay ahead
how the az@@ tec empire was built on fear and tribu@@ te ,
a tribu@@ te not only of things , but of people , 0@@ f human hearts ,
the name of the az@@ tec r@@ uler was monte@@ z@@ uma ,
but monte@@ z@@ uma was haun@@ ted by a proph@@ ec@@ y , a legend of an ex@@ iled god who one day would return to rec@@ la@@ im his thr@@ one ,
so the az@@ tec sp@@ ies ur@@ gently looked for signs ,
the strang@@ ers ' white food was it food of the gods ?
their pale faces , could they be divine ?
it sounds incredi@@ ble , and it probably sounded incredi@@ ble to the span@@ ish , but az@@ tec gods weren 't like christian ones .
they were more like the gods of the ancient gre@@ eks , cap@@ r@@ icious , wil@@ ful , mercur@@ ial , cruel .
and the most enig@@ mat@@ ic of them all was quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l .
and according to the legend , when quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l was ex@@ pel@@ led from mexico , he promised that one day he would return and reg@@ ain his kingdom .
that he 'd come back across that sea out to the east , back here , with his chal@@ ky white face and his be@@ ard in the az@@ tec year 1-@@ reed .
by an amazing chance , 52 to 1 chance this was that year !
and for the az@@ tec@@ s , nothing happened by chance ,
cortes 's men are getting nervous now , they know a great empire lies in@@ land , and they know cortes wants to go there ,
he acts fast , kil@@ ls the ring@@ leader , then , so no one can get away , he deci@@ des to pull his ships up on the beach and scu@@ pper them ,
it 's a gamb@@ ler 's throw , isn 't it , dest@@ ro@@ ying your own ships !
they won 't talk about going home any more .
typ@@ ical piece of cortes .
he knows what he needs to know about the az@@ tec@@ s .
but to persu@@ ade his men into the interior , he needs to hit@@ ch them to his dreams .
to leave them , as he put it , with nothing to rely on but their own hands and the assur@@ ance that they must either conqu@@ er or die .
the hes@@ itation was over , cortes heads in@@ land with some nat@@ ive allies from the coast who were ke@@ en to throw off the az@@ tec yo@@ ke ,
he took a back road towards monte@@ z@@ uma 's capital , ten@@ och@@ tit@@ lan , hoping along the way to find friends among monte@@ z@@ uma 's enem@@ ies ,
the town@@ s they came through are still here - co@@ at@@ ap@@ ec , x@@ ico ,
" every place we passed through , " says the conquist@@ ador bern@@ al diaz , " we saw altar@@ s for human sacrif@@ ice , by some , there were thous@@ ands of skul@@ ls , "
the christian in cortes was revol@@ ted
here in x@@ ico , he told the people they must give up their id@@ ols ,
speaking in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l , the az@@ tec language ,
mal@@ in@@ che gave a pot@@ ted history of christian@@ ity .
then she explained to the people the po@@ pe gave the king of sp@@ ain authority over their lands in the name of god .
there 's a story that two chie@@ fs who heard this were prepared to believe that there was one all-@@ powerful god , but as for the idea that the po@@ pe had given their lands to somebody else , the po@@ pe must have been drunk !
the span@@ i@@ ards were still trying to make sense of confus@@ ing signs ,
the sten@@ ch oo blood ming@@ led with the scent of flowers ,
familiar european categories of life and death , nur@@ ture and fe@@ eding , were up@@ side - down ,
to qu@@ en@@ ch their thir@@ st , the span@@ i@@ ards were given ju@@ ice bled from the fles@@ hy white heart of the mage c@@ actus ,
wow ! it 's absolutely beautiful .
0@@ n@@ ly to learn this was the drink given to sacrific@@ ial victi@@ ms to dul@@ l the senses of those who were about to die ,
" every , day , " says bern@@ al diaz , " we were told they 'd kill us " and eat our flesh with chil@@ lies , " and the warm drink made from the cac@@ ao bean ,
" was prepared for the eagle warriors who fe@@ ast@@ ed on the flesh of their enem@@ ies , "
wh@@ il@@ st human sacrif@@ ice is long gone , chocolate is still drunk here at religi@@ ous fe@@ asts ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
that 's " bu@@ enas tar@@ des " ?
how do you say " gracias " ?
( she trans@@ lat@@ es t@@ 0 nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
amazing !
and with the language , hin@@ ts of az@@ tec att@@ itudes to love and sex ,
for all their ob@@ session with death , the az@@ tec@@ s still loved life ,
( in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l ) we 'd better not ... ( he repe@@ ats her w@@ 0@@ r@@ ds )
i can 't tell you what that means !
cortes pushed on , and now we had to follow him on foot ,
" ahead of us , " says cortes , " we saw a great range oo beautiful mountains , " the pe@@ aks so white we think they must be covered with snow , "
with him , cortes had 300 conquist@@ ad@@ ors , 40 of them cross@@ bow@@ men , 20 mus@@ ket@@ e@@ ers ,
there were several hundred indi@@ ans , and cu@@ ban serv@@ ants , and , of course , his preci@@ ous horses - 15 of them ,
after a summer on the car@@ ib@@ bean coast , the span@@ i@@ ards were in for a shock ,
0@@ ne of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors , bern@@ al diaz , said when they came into the mountains , it rain@@ ed and rain@@ ed .
the path turned into tor@@ r@@ ents .
all they had was their cot@@ ton arm@@ our for the trop@@ ics .
they were un@@ prepared for the change of temperature , going up 11,@@ 000 feet .
so@@ aking wet and fre@@ ez@@ ing cold , some of their indian serv@@ ants died .
so far as we know , cortes had no military , training , but he never lost the respect of those who mar@@ ched with him ,
the thing you have to remember about the conquist@@ ad@@ ors is that , putting themselves through this , they were all volun@@ te@@ ers .
they were in it not for religion but a share of the prof@@ its .
they were free men .
they acknow@@ led@@ ged their leader 's authority but he had to pay attention to and respect them .
and they called each other " comp@@ ad@@ re . "
com@@ rade .
they 're all in it together .
- is that the path up here ?
- eh ?
- that 's the path , is it ?
- yes .
that little path up to the top ,
cortes called it " nombre de dios " - " the name of god . "
( rain dr@@ 0@@ wns 0@@ ut w@@ 0@@ r@@ ds ) 13@@ ,000 feet !
can 't see ...
~ muchas gracias !
those nights , the nat@@ ive women he 'd brought from the coast made them tor@@ til@@ las ,
some compen@@ sation ,
we have t@@ ents tonight and we are certainly going to be so@@ aking , cold and miser@@ able , just as her@@ nan cortes and his men were , as bern@@ al diaz tells the story .
those clouds are not going to lift .
as they mar@@ ched deeper in@@ land , they heard more about what lay ahead
" the loc@@ als said that to capture mexico would be impossible , " says bern@@ al diaz , " and we would all die , " but the more they told us that , the more we lon@@ ged to try , our fortune , "
after the mountains , though , things got no better ,
through au@@ tum@@ n ha@@ il@@ stor@@ ms , they tre@@ k@@ ked across a des@@ ol@@ ate plain of salt lak@@ es with no food or water ,
cortes was heading for the fer@@ tile land of t@@ lax@@ cala ,
t@@ lax@@ cala was an independent city state ,
they hated the az@@ tec@@ s ,
cortes was hoping they 'd shel@@ ter him , but his luck was out ,
they att@@ acked him in a sav@@ age battle , 0@@ n the battle@@ field , they still plo@@ ugh up the de@@ bris ,
- buenos dias .
- buenos dias .
est@@ oy bus@@ cando la ruta de her@@ nan cortes .
# la batalla ?
# es aqui ?
ah !
~ si , si , si !
looks like glass , but this is ob@@ si@@ dian .
see the sharp edge ?
they had a row of these things set into the wood of the clubs that they used .
nast@@ y wound , but nothing like span@@ ish steel .
" there were 149@@ ,000 of them , " cortes wrote to the king , in julius caesar mode ,
it was touch and go , he hung on grim@@ ly on this little hill for two weeks ,
then , with their own los@@ ses moun@@ ting to the span@@ ish guns , the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans offered him a deal ,
they wel@@ com@@ ed him to their town and laid on a fiesta , even offered their daugh@@ ters in marriage ,
the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans had realis@@ ed that these strang@@ ers with their guns could help free them from the az@@ tec@@ s ,
ever since , they 've been acc@@ used by other mexic@@ ans oo betr@@ aying their country , but of course , that 's not how they see it ,
( man spe@@ aks in span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) x@@ ico@@ ten@@ cat@@ l , the el@@ der , re@@ aches for her@@ nan cortes who re@@ turns the embr@@ ace , but doesn 't let go of his sword .
the old x@@ ico@@ ten@@ cat@@ l knew the future of his people was at st@@ ake .
he believed this alliance would en@@ sure that t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans would not dis@@ appear from the map , would not dis@@ appear from history .
the alliance of the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans is the turning point of the whole story , the turning point in the history of the new world .
with them , cortes found allies who hated the az@@ tec@@ s and would fight them to the death .
allies who would give him support , provis@@ ions and man@@ power .
the possibil@@ ity of con@@ quer@@ ing mexico was now on .
so cortes mar@@ ched on , with several thousand t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an warriors behind him ,
to the greatest pil@@ grim@@ age city in the americ@@ as , chol@@ ula , under the vol@@ cano popo@@ cat@@ ep@@ et@@ l ,
these were friends of the az@@ tec r@@ uler monte@@ z@@ uma , and the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans warned cortes to expect trouble ,
as the span@@ ish moved through the town , they saw road@@ blo@@ cks in the side streets .
pil@@ es of stones he@@ ap@@ ed on the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps , women and children evacu@@ ated .
then mal@@ in@@ che heard a story that a p@@ lot was being hat@@ ched to amb@@ us@@ h cortes .
he decided on a pre-@@ emp@@ tive strike .
he sum@@ mon@@ ed the 100 lor@@ ds of chol@@ ula to meet him in the temple of quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l - it 's now the church of san gabriel - and there mal@@ in@@ che told them in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l that they 'd commit@@ ted tre@@ ason and they 'd die .
the doors were closed .
the span@@ i@@ ards killed them all .
and they killed 3,000 more chol@@ ul@@ ans assem@@ bled outside .
then their t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an allies s@@ acked the town .
" and so death came to chol@@ ula , " says the az@@ tec account ,
" when we got the news , we were se@@ ized with fear ,
" it was as if the earth itself were shaking , "
" my heart bur@@ ns as if it ' s been washed in chil@@ lies , " said monte@@ z@@ uma ,
from chol@@ ula , cortes continued up the old track through the forest@@ s of p opo@@ cat@@ ep@@ et@@ l ,
it was erup@@ ting then , as it is now ,
into the valley of mexico ,
in the distant ha@@ ze , they began to make out a v@@ ast blue lake , and then , at last , far away , approached on immen@@ se ca@@ use@@ ways , was the city of cortes ' dreams ,
" it seemed like an en@@ chant@@ ed vision , " wrote one of his men ,
" indeed , some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream ,
" it was so wonderful " that i do not know how to describe this first glim@@ pse " of things never heard of seen or dre@@ amed oo before ,
" the city had trad@@ ers and warriors , pri@@ ests and law@@ yers , " mus@@ ici@@ ans , jug@@ g@@ lers , cour@@ tes@@ ans and scri@@ bes ,
" it was the most beautiful thing in the world , " wrote cortes ,
believe it or not , that 's where the ca@@ use@@ way came in in the 16@@ th century !
this is where the lake ended and the city began .
this is where cortes walked that november 1519 .
the az@@ tec city started here .
to find the place where cortes and monte@@ z@@ uma met , you have to go right into the commercial heart of modern mexico city ,
the site today is inside the hospital of jesus ,
to get there , you have to go through accident and emergen@@ cy@@ l
the az@@ tec@@ s led the span@@ ish into a great cour@@ t@@ yard fr@@ amed by a beautiful building that was on this spot .
the tale of that moment@@ ous meeting is told by the az@@ tec ey@@ e-@@ wit@@ nes@@ ses ,
this is where the two worl@@ ds met .
it 's where monte@@ z@@ uma ad@@ dressed cortes .
" 0@@ h , my lord , " he said ,
" you are fat@@ igu@@ ed , you are we@@ ary after your long journey .
" at last you have come down to earth .
" you have come to your city of mexico which i have guar@@ ded for you for a little while .
" they said you would return , and now you have done so .
" but first , go to your palace and rest .
" and go in peace . "
myster@@ ious words , but what do they mean ?
was this the language of az@@ tec diplom@@ acy ?
0@@ r monte@@ z@@ uma 's accep@@ tan@@ ce of destiny ?
no one knows ,
but in the az@@ tec calend@@ ar , that day , the 8@@ th of november , was 1-@@ wind , the day of quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l , a day of rob@@ ber@@ y viol@@ ation and dece@@ it ,
and the az@@ tec@@ s knew that nothing ever happened by chance ,
" it was as if we 'd all e@@ aten stu@@ pe@@ f@@ ying mus@@ h@@ rooms , " say the az@@ tec wit@@ nes@@ ses ,
" we kept our children off the streets and the city went to sleep
" in a fe@@ ar@@ ful slum@@ ber , "
the city woke as it always had
in the streets of the modern world , we can only dim@@ ly imagine its splen@@ d@@ our ,
the flu@@ tes and con@@ ch sh@@ ells gre@@ eting the dawn , the bust@@ le of mer@@ ch@@ ants , the thous@@ ands oo blo@@ oms carried each day to mark@@ ets dren@@ ched in the sc@@ ents of the americ@@ as ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were op@@ en-@@ mou@@ thed at the sig@@ h@@ ts , the gle@@ aming st@@ uc@@ co of the pal@@ aces and pyram@@ ids ,
they wander@@ ed the cour@@ t@@ yards , ga@@ w@@ ped at strange gods ,
but on the wind , with the scent of flowers , they caught the ever@@ -@@ present smell of death ,
and in their hearts , they fe@@ ared that cortes the gamb@@ ler had led them into the ja@@ ws of hell ,
monte@@ z@@ uma , though , was still un@@ sure who cortes was , and who his master was , the great king charles across the sea ,
so now monte@@ z@@ uma pro@@ udly shows cortes the pyram@@ id of the war god on whose sum@@ mit thous@@ ands of cap@@ tives had had their hearts cut out , perhaps the gods would recogn@@ ise each other ?
trying hard to appear calm , the span@@ i@@ ards entered the chamber ,
the first thing the span@@ ish noticed when they came inside was the dis@@ gust@@ ing smell .
as their eyes got used to the darkness , they saw the eyes of the az@@ tec gods staring at them , gle@@ aming with preci@@ ous stones .
the war god , hu@@ itz@@ ilo@@ po@@ cht@@ li , was sitting down with a golden bow and arrow .
in front of him was a braz@@ ier full of human hearts , still warm .
all around , the walls were en@@ cr@@ ust@@ ed with dri@@ ed blood .
cortes then said this to monte@@ z@@ uma -
" i don 't understand how a prince as great as you " and a man as intellig@@ ent as you , could think that these are gods .
" they are bad things called de@@ vil@@ s " and i 'd like your per@@ mission to put a cross and a picture of the virgin mary in here . "
monte@@ z@@ uma took off@@ ence at that .
" if i thought you were going to be so insul@@ ting to our gods , " i would never have brought you to see them .
" we hold these things to be good .
" they bring us health , har@@ v@@ est , rain and water " and we must sacrif@@ ice to them .
" so please don 't mention this again . "
it was quite a gul@@ f
for the christ@@ ians , god gave his blood to rede@@ em man@@ kind
for the az@@ tec@@ s , man@@ kind must give its blood to rede@@ em the gods ,
a week passed cortes had to act ,
he ra@@ ises the st@@ akes with an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able gamb@@ le ,
at gun@@ point he arrest@@ s monte@@ z@@ uma ,
" what we want you to do is to come over to the palace where we 're lo@@ d@@ ging .
" quietly and with no fus@@ s .
if you raise the alarm , we will kill you . "
monte@@ z@@ uma is amaz@@ ed .
nothing he learned in the palace of nobles prepared him for this .
" my person can@@ not be taken prison@@ er , " he says to cortes .
" even if i were to like it , my people would never accept it . "
the argument goes on for four hours , monte@@ z@@ uma in tears at one point .
all the while , cortes 's cap@@ tains are pac@@ ing up and down , getting more and more nervous .
0@@ ne of them says , " either he comes with us now or we kill him now . "
and when mal@@ in@@ che trans@@ lat@@ es that , monte@@ z@@ uma c@@ aves in .
monte@@ z@@ uma was now in cortes ' power , maybe under his spell ,
he continued to issue orders as if things were normal , but he 'd lost the trust of his people ,
the tale has been told many times ,
how the angry , mo@@ b besie@@ ged the span@@ ish , how cortes bul@@ lied poor broken monte@@ z@@ uma to ple@@ ad with them ,
but monte@@ z@@ uma 's aura had dra@@ ined away and his people killed him ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were tr@@ apped inside the city , food and water cut off ,
his dream sli@@ pping from his gras@@ p , cortes was forced to give the order to escape ,
you have to remember the city was on an island completely surrounded by water , lin@@ ked to the main@@ land only by three great ca@@ use@@ ways .
all the brid@@ ges had been broken by the az@@ tec@@ s .
so in those final few hours , the span@@ i@@ ards built a port@@ able wooden bridge out of the ceiling be@@ ams of where they were staying .
they would leave at midnight .
the night was clear , with a gentle rain ,
the span@@ i@@ ards mar@@ ched in silence , hug@@ ging their gold
half-@@ way into the lake , they were spotted
the alarm was raised and the city woke ,
cortes was tr@@ apped the az@@ tec wit@@ nes@@ ses name the place , today it 's by the little post office on the tac@@ uba road
three quar@@ ters of the span@@ i@@ ards were left behind - 800 men - killed , dro@@ wned or cap@@ tured .
the cap@@ tives could expect only one fate at the hands of the en@@ rag@@ ed az@@ tec@@ s .
they were taken back into the city to the great pyram@@ id .
there their hearts were cut out and offered to hu@@ itz@@ ilo@@ po@@ cht@@ li , the god of war .
0@@ n the far shore , cortes gathered the survi@@ vor@@ s by a huge ce@@ iba tree , it 's still there ,
mal@@ in@@ che , they say , showed no emotion ,
but cortes , for once , couldn ' t control his feelings ,
they said there were tears in cortes ' eyes that night , " the night of tears . "
but of all his com@@ ra@@ des who died , he asked after only one -
martin lopez , the ship@@ buil@@ der .
when cortes heard that lopez had survi@@ ved , although badly wo@@ unded , he said , " v@@ amos .
que nada nos falta . "
" 0@@ k , let 's go . for we lack nothing . "
" and when the span@@ i@@ ards had thus gone , " say the az@@ tec@@ s ,
" we thought they had gone for ever and would never return , "
but across the mountains , the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans stood by cortes ,
and what he does now is one of the most amazing things in history ,
in the middle of the land , he buil@@ ds a fle@@ et ,
that 's why he needed martin lopez ,
they 're going to build 13 brig@@ ant@@ ines .
all of them are more than 40 feet long .
then they 'll take them to bits and carry them to mexico city !
what does the maestro think about this ?
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) they dis@@ assem@@ bled the fle@@ et as there are no navig@@ able ri@@ vers round here .
for mexic@@ ans , cortes was a very cruel man .
but from a buc@@ can@@ e@@ ering point of view , he was great !
cortes would not let go of his dream ,
and now , in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably , the net began to tigh@@ ten around the az@@ tec@@ s ,
cortes transports his pre@@ fabric@@ ated fle@@ et , carried in pieces by a train of 8,000 t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an por@@ ters ,
across the mountains and back to the lake ,
0@@ n the lake shore , he waited , rein@@ forced now by thous@@ ands of hat@@ ive allies ,
it was may 1521 ,
cortes ' moment of destiny had arrived
it was to be nothing less than a war of the worl@@ ds ,
cortes ' plan was to lay siege to the city and cut off its food and water supp@@ lies , then , suppor@@ ted by his ships , he would attack it along the ca@@ use@@ ways , whose line is still marked today by the main routes into the city ,
it was a new kind of war@@ fare for the mexic@@ ans , invol@@ ving the ordin@@ ary population , women and children , star@@ ving them .
this wasn 't part of war in ancient mexico , but cortes was a modern man .
it was total war , the siege last@@ ed for 80 days ,
a quar@@ ter of a million people were reduc@@ ed to eating li@@ zar@@ ds and grass ,
devast@@ ated by european dis@@ eas@@ es , the az@@ tec@@ s under their new king , cu@@ au@@ h@@ tem@@ oc , still refused to nego@@ ti@@ ate and the span@@ ish had to win the city street by street ,
in the last battle , the az@@ tec@@ s were squ@@ as@@ hed into the warren of streets round the great pyram@@ id in the north , in t@@ lat@@ el@@ ol@@ co ,
i 'm looking for the ancient barrios of mexico city , not the modern ones .
i want to go to the area of tep@@ ito .
- tep@@ ito ?
- yeah . do you know it ?
yes , but it 's a little dangerous .
you don 't care ?
- well ...
you know it ?
- yeah .
- yac@@ aco@@ co ?
- no .
- lac@@ ol@@ ch@@ oko ?
am@@ as@@ hak ?
- no , i don 't know anything about it .
- do you have a map ?
- yes .
show me .
maybe i can help ...
jesus christ .
what kind of map is that ?
- it 's from 1772 !
- you have a rum deal , man !
mexico city 's got a bit bigger since then !
0@@ k .
it seems crazy , but this map , drawn in 1772 ,
mexico city is still inside what was the old island .
you can still see the network of can@@ als and the main roads of the az@@ tec city are still there .
to the end , the mexic@@ ans vie@@ wed the span@@ i@@ ards as con@@ temp@@ tible people who killed brave warriors at a distance with guns ,
in the az@@ tec calend@@ ar , the final day was 3-@@ serp@@ ent , the beginning of the time of lam@@ entation and remem@@ br@@ ance ,
the day human be@@ ings were reminded of their place in the re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess cycle of time ,
this is where the war ended , the exact spot .
this little church was built on the place where cu@@ au@@ h@@ tem@@ oc sur@@ ren@@ dered .
i find the az@@ tec version of this story as powerful and moving as homer 's " ili@@ ad , " the tale of troy .
the az@@ tec@@ s accept their fate without a trace of self-@@ p@@ ity .
it 's as if , in their vision of time and destiny , the cycle of history , the bun@@ dle of years , had just been lo@@ aded against them .
the az@@ tec lam@@ ent@@ ations have been handed down to us ,
" broken spears line the streets ,
" we have tor@@ n our hair in gri@@ ef
" 0@@ ur houses are ro@@ of@@ less now , " our walls red with blood
" 0@@ ur in@@ herit@@ ance , our city , is lost ,
" the shi@@ el@@ ds of our warriors were its def@@ ence " but they could not save it ,
" 0@@ ur heritage is gone , "
a year or two after the conqu@@ est , while a new mexico was rising on the ru@@ ins of the old ,
cortes fo@@ unded a hospital for the good of his soul on the spot where monte@@ z@@ uma had wel@@ com@@ ed him ,
by then , the king of sp@@ ain had sho@@ wered him with hon@@ ours ,
the poor boy from me@@ del@@ lin had become the most famous man in christ@@ en@@ dom ,
his tal@@ ents served him well .
the gamb@@ ler who gamb@@ led everything and won .
but maybe in the end it was a hol@@ low victory .
for in ach@@ ie@@ ving his dream , he had to ru@@ in it .
it 's given to few people in history sing@@ le-@@ han@@ de@@ dly to destroy a civil@@ isation .
( sl@@ 0@@ w drum@@ beat )
tru@@ j@@ illo , sp@@ ain .
in the early 16@@ th century two boys grew up here , dre@@ aming of gold and conqu@@ est ,
but when they left sp@@ ain for the new world , they became dead@@ ly enem@@ ies in one of the epic dram@@ as of history the search for el dor@@ ado ,
( train 's kla@@ x@@ 0@@ n bl@@ 0@@ ws )
this is the old route from the pacific up to quito in ecuador , in the 15@@ 30@@ s and ' 40@@ s , it was trav@@ el@@ led by advent@@ ur@@ ers and conquist@@ ad@@ ors , all hoping for riches beyond their dreams ,
even at the time , there were those among the span@@ ish con@@ quer@@ ors who realis@@ ed the immen@@ se histor@@ ical signific@@ ance of the fall of the new world .
" these are the greatest events , " wrote one of them , " since the beginning of the world . "
and the most cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic of them took place in just a few years , 15@@ 20@@ s , the fall of the az@@ tec@@ s , and then the fall of peru in the 15@@ 30@@ s .
and then the story shif@@ ts here to ecuador , as thous@@ ands of europe@@ ans flo@@ od into the continent , seek@@ ing new lands of gold .
among them was a span@@ ish captain called francisco 0@@ rel@@ lana ,
a vet@@ eran of the in@@ ca wars , 0@@ rel@@ lana was to be the hero of one of the most amazing jour@@ ne@@ ys of explor@@ ation ,
early in 1541 , he came here to quito ,
the old northern capital of the inc@@ as , quito was now a span@@ ish fron@@ tier town , 0@@ rel@@ lana had come to find his cousin , the new gover@@ nor gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
handsome and cruel , gonz@@ alo was in his early 30@@ s now , the greatest warrior in the new world
but gonz@@ alo was a man whose gre@@ ed had not been satisfied even by the gold of the inc@@ as ,
0@@ n@@ ly four years after the fall of p er@@ u , piz@@ ar@@ ro was dre@@ aming of he@@ w con@@ quest@@ s ,
from the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps of his palace in quito , he could see the andes rising to the east ,
early in 1541 , a rum@@ our began to swe@@ ep the city that beyond the mountains there lay a land rich@@ er than mexico or even peru ,
a land of gold
the r@@ uler of this land was said to be so rich that he covered himself in gold dust every , day and washed it off each evening ,
he was the golden man of el dor@@ ado ,
" i was fascin@@ ated , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" and i determined to disco@@ ver that land and to conqu@@ er it , "
and we set out to follow him ,
we took an expedition doctor with us , john col@@ ley ,
above 10,000 feet , you get altitude s@@ ick@@ ness potenti@@ ally , so where are we at now ?
yeah , we 're coming up to 12,000 feet here .
all through these camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s , they had to oper@@ ate at high altitude .
they develop@@ ed this kind of cot@@ ton , thick , quil@@ ted cot@@ ton arm@@ our to fight in the trop@@ ics .
but , of course , you 're dead on the equ@@ ator here , but you come to this altitude and you 're in serious trouble .
beyond the pe@@ aks , they entered a dren@@ ched green world , with stre@@ ams and water@@ falls , which eventually become the amazon ,
they might as well have been wander@@ ers on the surface of an alien planet ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's route has never been trac@@ ed on the ground
we know that for the first few months , he explo@@ red in a v@@ ast circle east@@ wards , but when his cousin 0@@ rel@@ lana joined him , they set off from their camp near ba@@ eza north@@ wards to the river co@@ ca ,
( man whist@@ les )
( man calls 0@@ ut ) - 0@@ k ?
- yeah .
0@@ h , jesus christ .
( gr@@ 0@@ ans )
how many people did piz@@ ar@@ ro bring down here ?
it 's quite sli@@ p@@ per@@ y here .

- 220 conquist@@ ad@@ ors .

to piz@@ ar@@ ro 's alarm , his v@@ ast army of nat@@ ive bear@@ ers was rapid@@ ly wast@@ ing away ,
the span@@ ish had 4,000 nat@@ ive bear@@ ers with them from the high@@ lands , but they all died by the time they reached the pl@@ ains .
the history books say they were high@@ land people who came down here and couldn 't cope , but why should 4,000 have died , do you think ?
was it malaria ?
not malaria .
that was something the span@@ ish brought over with them .
0@@ f course , there were all these other infec@@ ti@@ ous dis@@ eas@@ es like me@@ as@@ les and smal@@ l@@ po@@ x and so forth .
but these big waves of epide@@ mic@@ s would have been through already , before this expedition set off , so i wonder if there was something else .
we should ask del@@ ph@@ ine .
he 's the exper@@ t .
star@@ v@@ ation , i think .
del@@ ph@@ ine .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish ) 0@@ ur guide del@@ ph@@ ine was a man who knows how to survive in the forest ,
( b@@ 0@@ th speak span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) i don 't think it 's possible to find that much food for that many people , because you can 't always rely on the jungle to provi@@ de you with food or fruit .
i think it would be impossible to feed them .
star@@ v@@ ation .
you can imagine trying to find food in this area for that huge number of people .
so the 4,000 indi@@ ans bas@@ ically were star@@ ved to death .
i pres@@ ume they 'd be the bottom of the fe@@ eding chain as well .
and bas@@ ically left to f@@ end for themselves as things got really tou@@ gh .
" the terrain was terrible , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" we had to h@@ ack our own path through ,
" and we were worn out already from the cros@@ sing of the andes , "
frustr@@ ated and angry piz@@ ar@@ ro took it out on his nat@@ ive gu@@ ides , tor@@ turing them , burning them alive and fe@@ eding them to his dogs , not a man to argue with ,
food was a growing problem , even for the span@@ i@@ ards ,
" in the end , " says piz@@ ar@@ ro , " we were forced to eat the bu@@ ds of a plant like a v@@ ine stal@@ k , "
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
0@@ n@@ ly the little cur@@ ly bu@@ d on the top .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
that was before they started eating their preci@@ ous horses ,
at last we reached the first land@@ mark descri@@ bed by the span@@ ish ,
hidden behind the falls , legend says , was the gold of the in@@ ca at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) those who are in touch with nature believe that the spir@@ its exist@@ s here .
( span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) yes , this is a door to the spiritu@@ al world .
the real story of what 's behind the falls , not that it 's gold as the span@@ ish believed , but behind there is the entry to the world of the spir@@ its .
isn 't it wonderful ?
everything the span@@ ish understand liter@@ ally that the indi@@ ans actually mean metap@@ hor@@ ically .
" and so we pushed on through thick forest , " piz@@ ar@@ ro says ,
" h@@ acking with ax@@ es and mach@@ etes , "
" 0@@ ften it was impossible to get our horses through , "
see what an effort it is just to h@@ ack a path through virgin forest .
you 're lucky if you do a mile or two each day .
can you imagine what this was like for hund@@ reds of people and all their bag@@ gage and their animals trying to get their way through this ?
it just doesn 't bear thinking about .
at last , after six months in the jungle , they emer@@ ged from the andes fo@@ oth@@ il@@ ls and saw this view , an immen@@ se flat horizon ,
even with their limited knowledge , they must have known this stretched all the way to the atlantic , but how far was that and what lay in between ?
( michael ) the big stones .
there 's a branch under there .
they mar@@ ched on down the co@@ ca ,
" there were many days , " says piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" when we were wad@@ ing kne@@ e-@@ deep , wa@@ ist@@ -@@ deep or even worse , "
it 's deep .
and still no sign of el dor@@ ado ,
by now , seven months in , the army was de@@ mor@@ alis@@ ed many were too sick to move ,
though he hid it from his men , piz@@ ar@@ ro was desperate ,
0@@ rel@@ lana now tried to persu@@ ade him to turn back , but piz@@ ar@@ ro wouldn ' t give up his quest ,
he ordered his men to build a boat to carry , the sick and wo@@ unded and the heavy gear ,
it took his star@@ ving tro@@ ops a month to make , smel@@ ting their hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es to for@@ ge the nails ,
but there was an easier way , using ren@@ ew@@ able bal@@ sa wood , we made a tradition@@ al raf@@ t with hard@@ wood nails and ro@@ pes oo bar@@ k ,
with this , we hoped to follow piz@@ ar@@ ro down the co@@ ca to the river n@@ apo ,
it just goes to show .
the span@@ ish went to all that trouble about getting nails and you only need some hard wood and some soft wood and you can do it without metal .
we 'll see if it works .
( sh@@ 0@@ ut@@ ing )
it 's our brig@@ ant@@ ine .
i don 't think we 'll do the full 3,000 miles on that , though .
i don 't mind .
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's army set off again on the 9@@ th of november , 1541 , 0@@ f the beauti@@ es of the lands@@ cape around them , there 's no mention in his account ,
this is what you never read in the history books .
you never feel the sense of this immen@@ se forest , stret@@ ching for 2,000 or more miles .
this immen@@ se blue sky and this great river .
even with the boat , progress was pain@@ fully slow ,
they could still only go as fast as the army , tr@@ ud@@ ging along the bank ,
( thunder )
they mar@@ ched on for 43 days , christmas came ,
by now some of the span@@ i@@ ards were dying of star@@ v@@ ation ,
their christmas was made even more miser@@ able by the news that a v@@ ast un@@ in@@ habit@@ ed region lay ahead , where no food was to be found
it was piz@@ ar@@ ro 's nightmare ,
mut@@ in@@ y was in the air , and then 0@@ rel@@ lana stepped forward
that christmas , in their camp here by the river , the whole expedition deeply de@@ pressed by the strugg@@ le of the last ten months ,
0@@ rel@@ lana came up to piz@@ ar@@ ro and said , " look , give me the brig@@ ant@@ ine , give me the boat ,
" and a few can@@ o@@ es , some of the men and i 'll go down@@ stream
" to try and find some food and i 'll come back in three or four days . "
piz@@ ar@@ ro looked at him and said , " whatever you think 's best . "
0@@ rel@@ lana left next day with 57 men ,
but within days , so he said later , he realis@@ ed the current was too strong and he couldn ' t go back ,
" so we chose what seemed to us the les@@ ser of two ev@@ ils , " 0@@ rel@@ lana said ,
" trust@@ ing to god we 'd go on and follow the river
" and either die or see what mar@@ vel@@ s lay ahead "
what he didn ' t know was that ahead of him was the greatest river on earth ,
the first few days they passed through an empty lands@@ cape , che@@ wing their boots to stay alive , so close to death , they were hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ating ,
then , on mon@@ day evening , the 8@@ th of janu@@ ary they heard dr@@ ums , 0@@ rel@@ lana landed and nervo@@ usly went into the forest ,
they were the first europe@@ ans to walk in the interior of a maz@@ onia , - do you think they might be asleep ?
- i don 't think there 's any@@ body home right now .
they 've got their boots right here .
but they 're obviously ...
it 's closed up .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
there 's nobody here .
well , they did run away when 0@@ rel@@ lana first landed .
left their cook@@ ing pots and their food .
0@@ rel@@ lana 's men were star@@ ving , so , of course , they stu@@ ffed themselves .
the indi@@ ans were very nice about it when they came back .
the man 's name was tap@@ ui , nelson tap@@ ui ,
he far@@ med here with his family , pretty much cut off from the outside world
( speak span@@ ish )
he spoke que@@ chua , the in@@ ca language ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
0@@ h , he 'll have to talk slo@@ wer than that .
and language would be the key to 0@@ rel@@ lana 's surviv@@ al ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
he began to put words down in a no@@ te@@ book ,
what 's the name in que@@ chuan ?
- l@@ omo .
- l@@ omo .
so yo@@ ca is l@@ omo .
that 's very ...
" the captain made a point to get to understand the nat@@ ive langu@@ ages , " says the di@@ ary ,
and he made his own primer to help him , so if you ask for good water to drink , to drink .
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
nelson sent his son up a tree to bring se@@ ed po@@ ds for us to eat ,
the nat@@ ive people here were called imara , they gave 0@@ rel@@ lana food , too ,
they let the span@@ i@@ ards stay with them for a month to reco@@ ver their health ,
saved them from death ,
( they speak que@@ chuan )
can i open ?
0@@ k .
i could get into these .
del@@ icious .
- m@@ mm .
- m@@ mm .
at this moment , 0@@ rel@@ lana was still thinking like a conquist@@ ador , he told his host@@ s that he was claim@@ ing them and their land for the king of sp@@ ain ,
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
but maybe a change was beginning to take place in his mind , for kind treat@@ ment of the indi@@ ans , he said now , was the right way to follow ,
0@@ ver the coming months , 0@@ rel@@ lana would make contact with many different indian pe@@ op@@ les ,
some , like nelson , would feed and shel@@ ter him ,
some would try , to kill him ,
the mum gives us a smile .
she thought we were ali@@ ens at first .
back up@@ river , piz@@ ar@@ ro was waiting for 0@@ rel@@ lana to return , his men now dying around him ,
and as the days turned to weeks , he began to susp@@ ect that his lo@@ yal cousin might have betr@@ ayed him ,
0@@ rel@@ lana 's en@@ counter with the imara had offered hope of surviv@@ al ,
now he and his men decided to get their story , straight ,
they ap@@ pointed a scri@@ be to put down on paper why they 'd deser@@ ted p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
and each and every , one of them put his name to it ,
" we 've trav@@ el@@ led 200 le@@ ag@@ ues through sav@@ age jungle , " they said .
" we 've all seen it with our own eyes .
" we 've felt constant fear of losing our lives because of suff@@ ering and hunger .
" how much more danger and death would there be were we to turn back now ?
" there@@ fore we all beg you , " they say to 0@@ rel@@ lana , " not to ask us to do this .
" and we ask our scri@@ be to write it down .
" and we are all willing to follow you by any other route to save our lives .
" but not to turn back . "
but was 0@@ rel@@ lana being quite tru@@ th@@ ful ?
0@@ r did he hope to claim the secret of el dor@@ ado for himself
we continued on his track , down the co@@ ca to its jun@@ ction with the n@@ apo ,
not so long ago , this was just a mission station , now the town of francisco 0@@ rel@@ lana is a wild west place which has bo@@ omed with the opening up of the forest to the new conquist@@ ad@@ ors , the log@@ gers and the oil men ,
just looking round our@@ selves and seeing the open se@@ wers and dogs running wild and the terrible over@@ crow@@ ding and you suddenly understand why it was that dis@@ eas@@ es evol@@ ved in cities , where there are huge concentr@@ ations of people , rather than in the far heal@@ th@@ ier li@@ fest@@ yle of the jungle .
and this is , i suppose , the second conquist@@ o , isn 't it , you know .
first they came looking for gold and el dor@@ ado and now the forest@@ s are being pl@@ under@@ ed .
they 've had their rub@@ ber and now it 's the hard@@ woods and it 's black gold - oil .
- adi@@ os , amigo . - yeah , b@@ ye-@@ bye .
when you get to man@@ aus , remember , if you go sw@@ im@@ ming , don 't have a pee .
and so we said our good@@ b@@ yes to dr col@@ ley , 0@@ h , dear .
0@@ ur next leg would take us down the n@@ apo , the conquist@@ ad@@ ors ' river of cin@@ nam@@ on ,
here 's to the river n@@ apo .
0@@ rel@@ lana sa@@ iled on past other great ri@@ vers , the agu@@ ar@@ ico , the cur@@ aray , down into what is now peru ,
" we made good speed , " says the di@@ ary ,
" sometimes more than 20 le@@ ag@@ ues a day , for the river 's flow was swift and strong , "
0@@ rel@@ lana was now on one of the main trib@@ utar@@ ies of the amazon , heading east through a v@@ ast flu@@ id wil@@ dern@@ ess ,
from the air , it 's a be@@ wil@@ dering ma@@ ze ,
0@@ ut here nature seems to have no bo@@ unds ,
0@@ rel@@ lana and his men must have gazed on the scene , part in wonder , part in terror ,
a few days later , they came to a gig@@ antic conflu@@ ence , the n@@ apo and the mar@@ an@@ on , the beginning of the amazon proper ,
and as 0@@ rel@@ lana reached the mar@@ an@@ on , far to the west , piz@@ ar@@ ro had finally given up hope of seeing him again and ordered his men to turn back ,
there 's a shift now in the tone of the expedition di@@ ary , kept by the priest , father car@@ vaj@@ al ,
it may be hin@@ d@@ sight , but he seems aware now that the journey was turning into an epic of explor@@ ation ,
" it seemed to us , by our continu@@ ing surviv@@ al ,
" that our lord jesus was pleased with such a great vent@@ ure into the un@@ known ,
" for such a fe@@ at of discovery , surely might not otherwise have taken place
" for many centur@@ ies into the future , "
ah .

it was here that 0@@ rel@@ lana first heard strange stories of a fier@@ ce tri@@ be of female warriors , like the amaz@@ ons of gre@@ ek my@@ th ,
( rhyth@@ mic f@@ 0@@ l@@ k s@@ 0@@ ng )
his contempor@@ aries never believed him , but he always s@@ wore the tale was true ,
it 's a my@@ th which cro@@ ps up in many places and maybe it 's not just a my@@ th ,
the span@@ ish say that when they came down the amazon , there were all these trib@@ es that were rul@@ ed by women and only when they wanted children did they go and raid and get the men and have sex with them and get pregnant
and then they 'd boot the men out .
are there still ...
can you still find women like this on the amazon ?
( w@@ 0@@ man trans@@ lat@@ es )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) ah , domin@@ ant .
yes , there are woman who are domin@@ ant .
0@@ f course .
yes , there are women who have power over the men .
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings nat@@ ive fol@@ k@@ ball@@ ad )
no one knows for sure whether the amaz@@ ons really exist@@ ed
but they gave the river the name it still has today , rio amaz@@ onas , the river of the amaz@@ ons ,
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings fol@@ k@@ ball@@ ad )
all the way through what is now peru , the local people treated these strang@@ ers from another world kin@@ dly ,
but did 0@@ rel@@ lana ever see them as fully human like himself
i think he remained a conquist@@ ador ,
non@@ eth@@ eless , he was still carefully recor@@ ding words from the river langu@@ ages ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks l@@ 0@@ cal dial@@ ect )
" next to god , " says the di@@ ary " the captain 's understanding of the nat@@ ive langu@@ ages
" was the deci@@ ding factor in sav@@ ing us all from death , "
( they speak l@@ 0@@ cal dial@@ ect )
0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , is the first description of the pe@@ op@@ les of a maz@@ onia ,
" this part of the river , " he says , " they were part of a great federation , the ap@@ ari@@ ans , "
in the two centur@@ ies after the coming of the span@@ ish , 90 % of the population here died from violence and disease ,
today the survi@@ vor@@ s are people living after a holo@@ ca@@ ust ,
it was a trag@@ edy which went almost un@@ recor@@ ded
here in i@@ quit@@ os , father joaquin is trying to set the record straight , to reco@@ ver the lost history , of a maz@@ onia ,
( they speak span@@ ish )
in the 16@@ th century these were big town@@ s , large and well-@@ organis@@ ed commun@@ ities ,
so maybe what you see now is a distant remin@@ der of what 0@@ rel@@ lana saw ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) i had studied the case of 0@@ rel@@ lana for a long time and i conclu@@ ded that 0@@ rel@@ lana met a huge diver@@ sity of pe@@ op@@ les here .
we wondered what happened to all these people .
we rec@@ kon there were over six million in the whole of amaz@@ onia .
( michael ) the span@@ i@@ ards were amaz@@ ed by the natural produce of the forest and the river , the huge quant@@ ities of fish of every , kind , parro@@ ts , tur@@ t@@ les as large as leather shi@@ el@@ ds ,
( span@@ ish )
in his library father joaquin has a copy of the original di@@ ary ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
this is the hand ...

( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) " this account was written by fri@@ ar gas@@ par de car@@ vaj@@ al , " a fri@@ ar of the order of dominic@@ ans ,
" of the voyage of discovery down the great and famous river . "
the famous great river .
( read@@ s in span@@ ish )
" and i was an eye@@ wit@@ ness to these amazing things , " says car@@ vaj@@ al ,
" a man whom god chose to play a part in such a strange
" and hi@@ ther@@ to never experienced voyage of discovery , "
this is the next stage of our amaz@@ on@@ ian journey , the nat@@ alia carolina .
it says , " heading for cu@@ bag@@ ua today , six o '@@ clock .
" por mi madre sin falta . " " 0@@ n my mother without fa@@ il . "
well , it 's about half past six .
well ...
this is amazon time .
0@@ rel@@ lana stayed with the ap@@ ari@@ ans for two months to build a second , bigger boat , a 30-@@ fo@@ o@@ ter ,
a boat strong enough for the sea ,
when he left in late april , he still had 2,000 miles of river to go ,
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings )
the dream of el dor@@ ado is distant now , and for me the voyage had begun to ga@@ ther like stat@@ ic the history , of the interven@@ ing 500 years , the later conquist@@ ad@@ ors , like the de@@ ment@@ ed agu@@ ir@@ re , the so-@@ called w@@ rath of god
the mission@@ aries , the pro@@ spec@@ tors and the de@@ bt ra@@ id@@ ers , they all came this way ,
and the clam@@ our of history , rose like the sound of the forest in the night ,
and in the ghost@@ ly sha@@ pes we passed , it was easy to imagine the span@@ i@@ ards on their frag@@ ile craft ,
" what hard@@ ships , what suff@@ ering and what extraordin@@ ary , dang@@ ers we passed through , "
wrote fri@@ ar car@@ vaj@@ al , he lost an eye in one attack ,
" the people are more host@@ ile now , "
and as for 0@@ rel@@ lana , too kin@@ d-@@ hear@@ ted a soul by far , some said he had learned to read the signs and to nego@@ ti@@ ate fear , most of all , perhaps , in himself
they now began to see can@@ o@@ es everywhere , they were appro@@ aching even rich@@ er lands ,
by the middle point of the river , they came past huge sett@@ lem@@ ents , exten@@ ding for many miles , without any g@@ aps between the clu@@ sters of houses .
these were large , well-@@ organis@@ ed commun@@ ities , with thous@@ ands of people , real high cultures .
they were now inside the territory , of a huge nat@@ ive federation , which stretched for hund@@ reds of miles along the river , the 0@@ mag@@ ua , they passed so many town@@ s that they could only remember them by giving jo@@ key tag@@ s to people and places ,
main street , chin@@ ato@@ wn , vic@@ io@@ us@@ ville and stup@@ id@@ ville ,
so 0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , off@@ ers a new history , for amaz@@ onia , an elabor@@ ate series of ancient king@@ dom@@ s , net@@ works and alli@@ ances , which had develop@@ ed over thous@@ ands of years , united by the river itself
after three days ' sa@@ iling , we reached the braz@@ ili@@ an fron@@ tier ,
0@@ rel@@ lana had to pass a bor@@ der here , too - the fron@@ tier of the mach@@ i@@ par@@ o state ,
he had to fight his way through ,
it 's so relaxed today i couldn ' t find anyone to stam@@ p my pas@@ sport ,

but the spec@@ tre of gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro still haun@@ ted 0@@ rel@@ lana and his men ,
0@@ rel@@ lana never forgot the potential cost of cros@@ sing gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro , a member of the most powerful family in the americ@@ as .
deser@@ tion , after all , was pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death .
and their boy@@ hood friend@@ ship would count for very little .
so he and his men , all through the journey , covered themselves .
this is the second main document they drew up , formal@@ ly pet@@ ition@@ ing 0@@ rel@@ lana to be their leader , and every single member of the expedition has signed it , with loud protest@@ ations of lo@@ yal@@ ty to the gover@@ nor , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro .
but , at this moment , they had no idea whether piz@@ ar@@ ro was alive or dead .
piz@@ ar@@ ro , though , was a man who could face death without flin@@ ching ,
the tale of his hell@@ ish return has insp@@ i@@ red movies , pl@@ ays and books ever since ,
" for suff@@ ering , fam@@ ine and mis@@ ery " wrote one conquist@@ ador ,
" this was the worst journey ever in the indi@@ es , "
att@@ acked all the way , piz@@ ar@@ ro didn ' t know where he was or what direction to take to reach peru , or any place christ@@ ians might be ,
" we ate all our dogs and horses , " he wrote ,
" and we got back with only our s@@ words and the rotten rag@@ s we stood up in , "
pl@@ zar@@ ro 's only thought now was reven@@ ge against his boy@@ hood chum , the worst li@@ ar that ever there was ,
and 0@@ rel@@ lana sa@@ iled on , as amazing spectac@@ les of nature came one after the other ,
in early june , 0@@ rel@@ lana arrived at the site of man@@ aus , where the river stret@@ ches to the horizon , as wide as an in@@ land sea ,
man@@ aus was built in the centre of the rain@@ forest , fo@@ unded as a jesu@@ it mission in the 18@@ th century when the opening up of a maz@@ onia really started
where the opera house and the grand man@@ sions now stand , 0@@ rel@@ lana saw huge sett@@ lem@@ ents of hat@@ ive people lin@@ ing the water@@ front ,
there are few places where you feel more strong@@ ly the all-@@ consum@@ ing march of history ,
looking centur@@ ies into the future , 0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , says this -
" it was our desire that , if possible , the land and its barbar@@ ic people
" should not have negative feelings about our first en@@ counter ,
" so that one day the country , might be tam@@ ed for pac@@ ification
" and reduc@@ ed to obe@@ di@@ ence to our christian civil@@ isation , "
the western conception of a city was a new innov@@ ation in the americ@@ as which came with the conqu@@ est .
they requ@@ ire a new way of life , new la@@ ws and custom@@ s and institutions to make a new ident@@ ity , to res@@ ha@@ pe human@@ ity , if you like .
they also su@@ ck in the produc@@ ts of the natural world , of the forest and the river , and consum@@ e them .
and in that , cities like this , man@@ aus , re@@ present a break in that continu@@ um of thous@@ ands of years of life here in the americ@@ as .
there may have been five million indigen@@ ous people here , when 0@@ rel@@ lana came through .
the present population of the nat@@ ives of amaz@@ onia is 25@@ 0,000 , less than a quar@@ ter of this city .
that 's the scale of the revolution .
at last , after eight months on the river and against all the od@@ ds , in august , 15@@ 42 , 0@@ rel@@ lana reached the mouth of the amazon ,
they had sa@@ iled 2,@@ 500 miles down the greatest river on earth , they had seen un@@ known em@@ pi@@ res and en@@ counter@@ ed lost worl@@ ds ,
" it had been less of a journey , " said one of them , " more of a miracle , "
but even as their mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft bo@@ ats carried the 47 survi@@ vor@@ s to safety in the car@@ ib@@ bean , back in quito , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro was pet@@ ition@@ ing the king for reven@@ ge ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
piz@@ ar@@ ro acc@@ used 0@@ rel@@ lana of tre@@ ason , a crime pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death ,
" captain 0@@ rel@@ lana paid no heed to the duty that he o@@ wed your majest@@ y ,
" and to the well@@ being of the army and the whole expedition .
" instead of bringing us back food , he dis@@ played to us all the greatest cru@@ el@@ ty
" that ever fa@@ ith@@ less men have sho@@ wn .
" and he 's the worst trait@@ or that ever lived . "
in his def@@ ence , 0@@ rel@@ lana used the documents that they 'd drawn up on the river .
" piz@@ ar@@ ro wasn 't telling the truth .
what happened was his respon@@ sibil@@ ity .
" the fact was we couldn 't get back to him .
" and , in the end , it was god 's will that we went on to make such amazing disco@@ ver@@ ies . "
piz@@ ar@@ ro never came home ,
he died fighting the crown for his family 's empire in peru ,
his house is still there , the garden where he and gonz@@ alo crossed to@@ y s@@ words as boys ,
he married a weal@@ thy young wife , anna , but he couldn ' t sett@@ le back in sp@@ ain ,
he pet@@ ition@@ ed the king to send him back to his river , with the title of gover@@ nor of the amazon ,
but his luck ran out , the expedition was a dis@@ aster ,
this is how anna remembered 0@@ rel@@ lana 's death .
" my husband couldn 't find the main channel of the river
" and , for 11 months , we wander@@ ed around like lost people .
" and in that time , we suff@@ ered such hard@@ ships ,
" because of hunger , disease and inc@@ es@@ sant rain@@ fall .
" we ate all the horses and the dogs
" and , in the end , almost all the expedition died .
" my husband among them . "
hello , i would like you to touch wood
do you know this expression ?
the e@@ asi@@ est way to understand it is refer@@ ring to the he@@ at@@ wave of 2003 we have well known , may be more in the coun@@ try@@ side with agricul@@ tural production .
in 2003 this is my place that 's what grew and i did not har@@ vest@@ ed .
when we see this as a far@@ mer one has the right to wonder about the future .
that 's why i brought you wood that i will distribu@@ te .
touching wood , i think it 's good
it makes you feel calm .
it 's nice and it sm@@ ells good .
here 's a piece for each of you , if you want to distribu@@ te .
it 's cherry and plu@@ m .
there are probably few in paris .
pass it to the others and we will do a simple exper@@ iment
to show that these branches are the future of agriculture .
it seems crazy !
we hear of agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the br@@ ink and we are on the br@@ ink .
i 'll show you the same experience as i had .
you take the branch and you do like that .
it can be sha@@ ped like a circle very easily .
and what i experienced in 2003 , in 2004 i did not experienced .
because the fle@@ xi@@ bil@@ ity of these small branches that are produc@@ ed every year growing every day the forest makes them .
the best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans .
agriculture has deriv@@ ed to the assist@@ ant@@ ship , to technology .
far@@ mers who don 't understand ground anymore .
far@@ mers have forgotten that the best model and prag@@ mat@@ ism of life encour@@ age us to watch the living .
from the living , the forest is the best ex@@ ample .
no human intervention no wat@@ ering , no fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ ers , pest@@ ici@@ des , fung@@ ici@@ des it works alone .
when i discovered the fle@@ xi@@ bil@@ ity of the small branch i wondered :
why the branches of large diam@@ eter break easily ?
wh@@ ere@@ as we can shape small branches as a circle that re@@ present the virtu@@ ous circle of trees which produ@@ ces branches in huge quant@@ ities .
i found on the internet an explan@@ ation of the forest and its so@@ il .
we learn that leaves are att@@ ached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall .
they re@@ store 50 to 60 % of their content to the branches .
in this branch you are holding ,
there all the nu@@ tri@@ ents which allow bu@@ ds in a few months to make new branches which con@@ tain branches for the following year .
trees re@@ start their grow@@ th only with the content of the small branches .
on large diam@@ eter branches there are no such nu@@ tri@@ ents .
as you read this , you think you can already act individu@@ ally and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches .
the more we are numer@@ ous and the more is the occasion to meet , to live well then we cut the branches , we ga@@ ther them we make pile and grin@@ d it in a machine .
this is a techn@@ ical operation , but not insur@@ moun@@ table .
in africa , we do it with a mach@@ ete .
we spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm , no more .
we realize that this is not pro@@ hibit@@ ive for a garden with this material which is hidden here .
i will open it later .
when it is placed on the ground in winter , spring we incorpor@@ ate it .
you mean there is something about se@@ as@@ ons ?
yes , indeed .
at the arri@@ val of winter , the branches store nu@@ tri@@ ents .
it 's going nowhere but in the branches , only at that time .
in the spring , those elements are diff@@ used again .
so we proce@@ ed to what is called incorpor@@ ation .
after a few weeks the agricul@@ tural so@@ il that was here main@@ ly stones has become this .
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer .
here is the top and there underneath .
we see my@@ cel@@ ium , the real mus@@ h@@ room .
the my@@ cel@@ ium is our collabor@@ ator to do what nature does only with mus@@ h@@ rooms food chain with the lig@@ nin molec@@ ule .
the lig@@ nin molec@@ ule is very ener@@ ge@@ tic and here comes a complex food chain of the so@@ il .
the cultiv@@ ated agricul@@ tural land be@@ comes a forest so@@ il .
it is a copy / pa@@ ste of forest so@@ il / agricul@@ tural land .
it works surpris@@ ingly for this st@@ ony so@@ il with the r@@ cw to grow whe@@ at
with y@@ iel@@ ds almost higher than normal .
the surprise is enor@@ mous , because the trees grow too as well as veg@@ etab@@ les .
there you are on lim@@ est@@ one plate@@ aus of quer@@ cy i invite you to my place .
i brought you brac@@ n@@ ches from my place , but here it is .
z@@ uc@@ chini grow in full sun .
no wat@@ ering , just se@@ ed@@ lings .
i plant the se@@ eds in the ground and wait for it to grow .
this year , with 12 z@@ uc@@ chin@@ is , i picked up 190 kil@@ os .
no wat@@ ering , no phy@@ to@@ sanit@@ ary treat@@ ment , no we@@ ed control .
it might looks like the garden of eden we put the se@@ eds in the ground and har@@ v@@ est .
these are my productions .
un@@ fe@@ as@@ ible on the plateau .
when you say you are going to grow car@@ ro@@ ts on lim@@ est@@ one plate@@ aus everyone says it , ag@@ ron@@ om@@ ists , exper@@ ts there are 30 to 40 % of stones ,
30 cm of so@@ il , impossible .
no water , no fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ er , no treat@@ ment .
y@@ iel@@ ds are 160 to 170 % .
the amount of dry matter is 30 % extra .
which means that the pl@@ ants have less water and are ta@@ st@@ ier they over@@ cook less easily and preserv@@ ation is much longer .
no evidence of disease , pl@@ ague , ap@@ hi@@ ds or pest@@ s
it seems mag@@ ical .
no human intervention .
it is like facing the forest without human intervention .
is it still agriculture ?
is this a new concept ?
even in mali , burkina faso , togo , gest@@ ures are the same , the resul@@ ts are the same .
when small branches are grin@@ ded , we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenom@@ en@@ on .
mus@@ h@@ rooms of a certain family will take nu@@ tri@@ ents trig@@ gers a food chain which indu@@ ces life returning in so@@ il .
i have not mentioned the name , but it is r@@ cw
w for wood
r for ram@@ ial , branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree be@@ aring leaves , where photo@@ synth@@ esis happens .
energy from the sun , trans@@ formed by the leaves is sto@@ red in the branches
this concept bo@@ thers ag@@ ron@@ om@@ y , the far@@ ming profes@@ sion must be re@@ invent@@ ed .
you imagine a farm with 20 to 30 % of forest area or wood .
it can occu@@ r without so@@ il condit@@ ion@@ er with 50 % less water at least and a y@@ ield of 160 to 170 % .
you do it every 4-5 years .
it is about sust@@ ain@@ ability
this concept affec@@ ts many people but research has diffic@@ ulti@@ es to take it in account .
this pack@@ age , for those who want , we can share it because it works in the garden , in a flower pot , with a lem@@ on tree or a plant that you like .
you put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
you will have the most beautiful fruits less wat@@ ering needs and besides it 's beautiful , it sm@@ ells good .
for those that want to smell and take some there is a charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic smell of forest .
i invite you to share this meal with the ground .
note :
c of r@@ cw stands for chip@@ ped
sub@@ title and trans@@ lation :
this is a rock@@ et sto@@ ve .
rock@@ et sto@@ ves gener@@ ally cre@@ ate much more eff@@ ici@@ ent combust@@ ion and are better able to store heat than conven@@ tionn@@ al sto@@ ves .
and so , i decided i wanted to build this sto@@ ve rather than use the previ@@ ous one that i had because i wanted to be putting less pollu@@ tion into the atmosphere but also this sto@@ ve , you actually feed wood into the top
which means that you can put long pieces of wood , directly into the sto@@ ve and it doesn 't have to be cut to be able to burn .
so , i can put the wood in here and the burning actually happens down in the bottom of this area and then , the flu@@ e gas will travel through the sto@@ ve there is a ris@@ er up inside the bar@@ rel itself
that cre@@ ates a draft so that you can actually have the wood fe@@ eding in through the top and then the flu@@ e gas will travel up , hit the top of the bar@@ el on the inside and then there is an opening on the outside .
on the inside of the bar@@ rel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle .
all the flu@@ e gas will travel down around the outside of the bar@@ rel and out through the back and up , out of the chim@@ ney .
all this co@@ b here that surro@@ unds the sto@@ ve is desig@@ ned to capture the heat from the combust@@ ion so that it 's not just all going straight up the chim@@ ney .
with a conven@@ tionn@@ al sto@@ ve the heat ten@@ ds to travel out of the building very quickly .
this allo@@ ws for more of the heat to be sto@@ red in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the co@@ b .
so , this is the sky house rock@@ et sto@@ ve
it is a sort of a wall in between our din@@ ning room and our living room .
bas@@ ically , you got the in@@ take here the bar@@ rel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of co@@ b surro@@ unding most of the bar@@ rel here .
this entire wall is actually a co@@ b wall .
bas@@ ically we got a lot more mass to store heat in we 've got a little bit of area where the bar@@ rel is ex@@ posed so that is gon@@ na through heat in the room quickly when you first light the sto@@ ve but for the most part we are looking at the sto@@ ve
to store heat for a long time and we burn the fire here in the morning , we can run it for a few hours and all of this co@@ b will still be warm into the evening .
so , here we are on the other side of the wall , in the din@@ ing room .
here is the other side of the bar@@ rel en@@ cas@@ ed in co@@ b and then the flu@@ e of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve runs all the way through this bench and up that chim@@ ney .
one of the benef@@ it of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve is that you can have a long horizon@@ tal run of your flu@@ e p@@ ipe and you can monit@@ or a bench or under a bed or wh@@ er@@ ever you want to store that heat .
normally we have a table here so this one of the seat of the table , that is very popular when we are in winter cause this area gon@@ na stay warm pretty much all day until the evening if we fire the rock@@ et sto@@ ve that day .
there is about 4 to 6 inches of co@@ b on top of the flu@@ e here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it he@@ ats up .
i would say 2 or 3 hours but then it w@@ il stay warm thro@@ ugh@@ out the day .
the front of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve there is only about 2 inches between the flu@@ e and the front and that he@@ ats up a little faster sometimes it is almost a little too hot so that 4 inches is really great if it 's going
to be an area , where you are physic@@ ally in contact with .
like this bench .
we oil the bench to water@@ proof it cause it is near the table .
the chim@@ ney runs up as co@@ b all the way up into the second story and that , again sto@@ res ther@@ mal mass up into the bedro@@ oms , upstairs as well .
sub@@ tit@@ les :
welcome to bas@@ alt mountain lo@@ cated on the northern rim of the ro@@ aring fork valley in colorado .
the clim@@ ate here is hot and dry in the summer and fri@@ gi@@ d in the winter .
to the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here .
until now no one would have considered far@@ ming in this dry rocky nu@@ tri@@ ent poor so@@ il .
but thanks to our current understanding of nature 's natural proces@@ ses one man has built up a nu@@ tri@@ ent rich so@@ il upon this dry un@@ des@@ ir@@ able clay forming the foundation for a th@@ ri@@ ving eco@@ system
jerome o@@ sen@@ to@@ wski is the man behind the eco@@ system and the central rocky mountain per@@ macul@@ ture institute .
nest@@ led on the side of bas@@ alt mountain l@@ ye one acre of edi@@ ble forest garden guil@@ ds and four pas@@ sive and active solar green@@ houses which have become a large part of jerome 's most recent per@@ macul@@ ture ende@@ av@@ ors
i came to colorado in 1969 and i spent about the first seven or eight , ten years as a ski instruc@@ tor .
and gradu@@ ally got interested in heal@@ thy fo@@ ods
through having some@@ what of a health crisis with hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia so i decided to look into wild fo@@ ods and that lead me into growing my own gar@@ dens and using wild fo@@ ods when it was avail@@ able
jerome began gar@@ den@@ ing in the low@@ lands of the bas@@ alt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on bas@@ alt mountain due to the ar@@ id so@@ ils and difficul@@ ty in har@@ nes@@ sing water but once i learned about per@@ macul@@ ture
i found that it was totally possible to cre@@ ate these beautiful gar@@ dens using rec@@ yc@@ led materi@@ als , and building compo@@ st , sheet mul@@ ching , using per@@ en@@ ni@@ al and ann@@ ual veg@@ etab@@ les
in combin@@ ations of design@@ s
so , we started ann@@ ual gar@@ den@@ ing here for ten years or so and then we gradu@@ ally segu@@ ed into per@@ en@@ ni@@ al poly@@ cultures outside and now inside and we 've taught hund@@ reds of people here through intern@@ ship program@@ s and through the different design courses and work@@ sho@@ ps here .
what 's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combin@@ ation of pl@@ ants in our forest gar@@ dens and see how we build our green@@ house
but jerome 's succes@@ s in per@@ macul@@ ture hasn 't come without some major road blo@@ cks
in 2008 a devast@@ ating fire burned down one of his first tropical green@@ house 's iron@@ ically named p@@ ele [ after the hawa@@ i@@ ian fire god@@ dess ] to the ground .
the fire in p@@ ele was actually a bles@@ sing in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger , better green@@ house .
so i worked with michael thomson my partner in eco@@ systems design to re@@ design the new green@@ house .
at the time that p@@ ele burned down jerome had been working with well know local archit@@ ect michael thompson on advan@@ cing green@@ house design by introduc@@ ing what jerome called " clim@@ ate batter@@ y technology "
the destruction of p@@ ele gave the two the chance to put their lat@@ est research to the test and in the spirit on new begin@@ n@@ ings the new green@@ house would be named phoenix after the myth@@ ological bird that bur@@ ns itself and r@@ ises from the ash@@ es to live through another cycle .
hi i 'm michael thompson ,
i 'm chief archit@@ ect with eco@@ systems design in bas@@ alt colorado and partner with jerome o@@ sen@@ to@@ wski .
the clim@@ ate batter@@ y as we now call it , is a series of tu@@ bing in which air is taken in at the high point of the green@@ house , pum@@ ped through tu@@ bing , and exhaust@@ ed at the south end of the green@@ house .
and then that air circul@@ ates over and over again picking up heat and then deli@@ vering it underground and stor@@ ing it .
so at eco@@ systems design , we cre@@ ate design@@ s for green@@ houses and pas@@ sive solar buildings and hom@@ es as well as out@@ door lands@@ cap@@ ing per@@ en@@ ni@@ als and annu@@ als for organ@@ ic agriculture in the rocky mountain region .
in ad@@ dition to desig@@ ning in@@ door and out@@ door per@@ macul@@ ture and edi@@ ble lands@@ cap@@ es
we cre@@ ate the buildings that allow that in@@ door growing , such as this one in ste@@ am@@ boat springs .
this is a large thirty six by eigh@@ ty foot green@@ house that will support sub-@@ tropical and anything below that .
and here we have inside the green@@ house , all of these plant@@ ing be@@ ds that we have created above ground and under ground we have these forced air heat stor@@ age systems
so all of these fans are deli@@ vering air through these vertic@@ al ris@@ ers which then underground distribu@@ te the warm air through these horizon@@ tal manif@@ olds through these per@@ for@@ ated tu@@ bes that deli@@ ver the heat and the mo@@ ist@@ ure from that air into the so@@ il for use later in the cold nights .
so as a res@@ ult we get these in@@ door environ@@ ments that are very well insul@@ ated and he@@ ated against winter conditions such as this last year .
and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experien@@ cing is uh@@ h ...
this is when we began the plant@@ ing of this green@@ house last au@@ tum@@ n , and this spring we had this much grow@@ th in there .
so we have flowers , we have other pl@@ ants that support the insec@@ t populations for benefici@@ al control@@ s and for pol@@ lin@@ ation , and we have all of the so@@ il conditions and the clim@@ ate conditions to grow tropical ban@@ ana pl@@ ants , and gu@@ av@@ as and fig@@ s and pap@@ aya et@@ cet@@ era .
and these green@@ houses also function very well as early propag@@ ation cent@@ ers
where we can start the pl@@ ants in febru@@ ary that will grow out@@ doors as annu@@ als .
we also have clim@@ ate control equip@@ ment like these cur@@ tains that draw across underneath the g@@ laz@@ ing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insul@@ ating layer for accompl@@ ishing that .
so we also do solar hom@@ es solar energy produc@@ tive buildings .
in ad@@ dition to desig@@ ning green@@ houses for private invest@@ ors cr@@ mp@@ i and growing sp@@ aces are building growing dom@@ es for local scho@@ ols in colorado in order to raise a@@ waren@@ ess about the importance of a local food econom@@ y .
the institute has cur@@ r@@ ently built a growing dome at y@@ ampa mountain high school in glen@@ wood springs and the ro@@ aring fork high school in carbon@@ dale both facilit@@ ies will be utiliz@@ ed as class@@ rooms for sust@@ ain@@ able agriculture cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ ums and the food produc@@ ed will be integr@@ ated into the school lun@@ ches@@ . there you can find out more about our services and brow@@ se our design galler@@ ies .
for more information about the central rocky mountain per@@ macul@@ ture institute and how you can contribu@@ te please visit cr@@ mp@@ i.@@ org there you 'll find deta@@ iled information about our growing dome projec@@ ts via the community food initiative as well as work@@ shop dates and intern@@ ship avail@@ ability .
and built the geo@@ desi@@ c growing dom@@ es used at the local high scho@@ ols and special thanks to john cru@@ ick@@ sh@@ ank for his role in the techn@@ ological advan@@ c@@ ements of what is now called the clim@@ ate batter@@ y

water
water is
water is life .
bassin de reten@@ tion d '@@ eau a tam@@ era ( portugal )
avec sep@@ p hol@@ zer et ben@@ rd muller
water is life .
water is the most important thing .
the whole world is 70 % water .
we , animals , every@@ th@@ ing-@@ 70 % water .
water is the key issue for the surviv@@ al human kind on this planet .
nature has provi@@ ded enough water everywhere on earth ;
but , a bil@@ lion people do not have suff@@ ici@@ ent access to clean drinking water .
more and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need .
centr@@ aliz@@ ed systems of artific@@ ial water management can@@ not sol@@ ve this problem .
we need de-@@ centr@@ aliz@@ ed systems of natural water management .
we are in tam@@ era peace research center in southern portugal , where a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape has been in development since summer 2007 .
bern@@ d muller is responsible for tam@@ era 's ec@@ ological research work .
in 2007 the community of tam@@ era still had the question whether a site of this size threaten@@ ed by deser@@ tific@@ ation could provi@@ de food , water and energy for 300 people .
we vis@@ ited sep@@ p hol@@ zer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water lands@@ cape .
sep@@ p hol@@ zer , an austri@@ an mountain far@@ mer , is a well-@@ known speci@@ alist and vision@@ ary for per@@ macul@@ ture and lands@@ cape heal@@ ing .
water is always at the core of his work .
for me water is the most important capital .
wh@@ er@@ ever it 's possible , you should cre@@ ate reten@@ tion sp@@ aces and collec@@ t the rain water and re-@@ learn with the water how to main@@ tain a balance .
this is the most important thing because once you 've created the right hydr@@ ological balance ,
70 % of the work is done .
ou help rich veget@@ ation to dev@@ el@@ op , diver@@ sity e@@ cause nature can reve@@ al itself and dev@@ el@@ op in the right way .
trav@@ eling through the world i have not seen a single situation , nation or land in which the development of a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape would not give the first important heal@@ ing impul@@ ses .
in many parts of the world , coun@@ tries are not able to feed their population anymore . they have been unable to main@@ tain their natural wild@@ life for a long time .
as a consul@@ tant in many coun@@ tries
sep@@ p hol@@ zer sees the consequence of de@@ forest@@ ation , mon@@ ocul@@ ture , over@@ graz@@ ing and industrial agriculture .
all these fac@@ tors destroy the natural water balance .
the so@@ il is dr@@ ying out . water is being lost and the reten@@ tion space , the natural water stor@@ age system of the earth , is becoming dry and the flora and fauna dis@@ appear .
in the end the land will turn into desert or burn e@@ cause it 's so dry .
you can see these problems happening all over the world , bringing huge catastro@@ phes .
and the heavy ra@@ ins come anyway .
what happens then ?
the water rus@@ hes down the slo@@ pes because the dry so@@ il does not absor@@ b the water .
when the so@@ il is hot@@ ter than the falling rain it rej@@ ec@@ ts the water .
only when the so@@ il is cool@@ er , when the veget@@ ation is giving shadow then it at@@ trac@@ ts the water and lets it se@@ ep in .
this is the construction site for a new water reten@@ tion space in tam@@ era .
wh@@ er@@ ever you work with so@@ il you can read the signs of ero@@ sion .
top@@ so@@ il should actually form a thick , living layer everywhere on the ground which en@@ ables rain@@ water to fil@@ ter in .
but , this layer has been ero@@ ded away .
now the top@@ so@@ il lies in lay@@ ers many met@@ ers thick in the bottom of valle@@ ys or is found as mud in ri@@ vers .
the surface of fields and sites higher up is dep@@ let@@ ed and bar@@ ren .
de-@@ centr@@ aliz@@ ed water reten@@ tion lands@@ cap@@ es give the water time to fil@@ ter back into the earth body .
people always have the same questions , always the same wor@@ ries , where will all this water come from ?
in such dust@@ y dry so@@ il without stre@@ ams or a river .
how can i build a lake here ?
people have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the cat@@ ch@@ ment area and the rain , the bles@@ sing of the water in the right way .
when i use the cat@@ ch@@ ment area , there@@ upon , the lake will fill very quickly .
how much water can change a lands@@ cape in a short time .
we can see here , compar@@ ing tam@@ era before the creation of lake 1 and today .
water reten@@ tion lands@@ cap@@ es can be built everywhere .
anywhere on earth .
a water reten@@ tion space must not be se@@ aled with concre@@ te or plastic .
it is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the nar@@ ro@@ west point of a valley .
you dig a dit@@ ch until you reach an imper@@ me@@ able layer .
on that solid ground you ap@@ ply layer after layer of fine material , like mo@@ ist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water bar@@ rier .
this water bar@@ rier is the core of the dam .
for the outside of the dam i take course material , it doesn 't have to be den@@ se and wat@@ er-@@ proof . of course ,
i will also have to comp@@ act it by driving on it and rolling it .
and like this , i build the whole dam , the water bar@@ rier in the core nd on the outside in a slo@@ pe of 1 to 2 , 1 meter up and 2 met@@ ers along , like this i build the two lay@@ ers together , up to the top .
the water reten@@ tion sp@@ aces have win@@ ding banks , shal@@ low and deep zones , a diverse veget@@ ation of water pl@@ ants and are built alig@@ ned to the pre@@ v@@ ail@@ ing wind direction this way the water is always moving , is en@@ rich@@ ed with oxy@@ gen ,
the water in a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape st@@ ays fresh and alive by itself .
since we created the first reten@@ tion space , we can already keep much of the water from the winter rain@@ falls on the land .
in this way in can un@@ fold its full heal@@ ing capac@@ ity , the wild@@ life is respon@@ ding and is returning and the veget@@ ation is reco@@ vering .
we can plant fruit trees again , the forest@@ s reco@@ ver and we can grow our food for people and for animals in the direct surro@@ und@@ ings of the first reten@@ tion space .
the water which used to run away and which is now sto@@ red here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole gro@@ und@@ water system .
in the first year , a spring develop@@ ed below this lake which now gives water thro@@ ugh@@ out the year .
since we built this first dam , we no longer have such big vari@@ ations with a lot of flo@@ wing water in winter when it 's rain@@ ing and dro@@ ugh@@ ts in the summer .
we have a more constant water situation thro@@ ugh@@ out the year , which is of course a huge benef@@ it for nature .
nature shows you how this works , you just have to ask her , have to contact her , to communic@@ ate with her , then you will be fine anywhere on earth .
ask nature , think with her and not against her .
put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need .
make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen .
a forest garden is a three dimension@@ al garden of use@@ ful pl@@ ants .
so there 's trees , shr@@ ub@@ s , ground cover pl@@ ants , per@@ en@@ ni@@ al pl@@ ants all desig@@ ned to maxim@@ ise benefici@@ al inter@@ actions and minim@@ ize competition , desig@@ ned to be sust@@ ain@@ able in the long term by having pl@@ ants that feed other pl@@ ants by having pl@@ ants for be@@ es to sust@@ ain a pol@@ lin@@ ating population ,
sust@@ ain@@ able from other ways too , because most of the pl@@ ants are per@@ en@@ ni@@ al , you know trees or smaller pl@@ ants and so the so@@ il is not dug most of the time and not dig@@ ging the so@@ il is really important in term of sust@@ ain@@ ability
because every time you dig the so@@ il , a lot of carbon goes into the air .
this is chinese dog@@ wood , which is as you can see , a fantast@@ ic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edi@@ ble fruit which fol@@ lows later in the year .
apart from food , there are various other things you can grow and i do in this forest garden so i include medi@@ cin@@ al pl@@ ants ,
i include pl@@ ants for dying , for bas@@ ke@@ try use , pl@@ ants for fi@@ bers , there are of course a lot of bee pl@@ ants , sometimes pl@@ ants are here speci@@ fic@@ ally for be@@ es , so you might look at a particular plant in this forest garden
and i won 't neces@@ sar@@ ily har@@ v@@ est that plant myself it might have a system function in ter@@ ms of fe@@ eding another plant , or it might be here speci@@ fic@@ ally for be@@ es because if flowers are at a good time of year for be@@ es
and so on . so there is pl@@ ants for all sources of different uses .
there 's ... i think forest gar@@ dens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gar@@ dens .
of course ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am agriculture of course is completely depen@@ dent on oil , and you know what happens to oil will have a big effect and of course the oil price will may certainly go up and up over the de@@ ca@@ des to come ,
because , you know , dem@@ and will ex@@ ce@@ ed sup@@ ply . in this country particularly , you know , tree ... you know , far@@ mers don 't tend to know much about trees and fore@@ sters don 't know much about far@@ ming and agro@@ fore@@ str@@ y which is kind of in the middle of the two
there@@ fore is quite ... seems quite difficult for people and far@@ mers to access because , you know , they are not comfortable with trees .
so that 's a potential problem that could slow down , you know , the implement@@ ation of more agro@@ fore@@ str@@ y based systems on far@@ ming .
but i think it needs to happen and i think slowly it will happen but ...
i think it will take ... un@@ fortun@@ al@@ ety i think it will take a crisis or two , you know a serious crisis or two , to actually jol@@ t the powers of be into actually you know , making it happen quick@@ er .
this is one of my main sal@@ ad leaves from the forest garden , it 's the young le@@ af you use , this kind of le@@ af , not the old one , the old ones would be tou@@ gh .
an interesting parallel to times which may be coming you know , when in the cold war years the so@@ viet union did a lot of fruit bre@@ eding because they wanted to be self suff@@ ici@@ ent in fruit , you know , they didn 't want to have to im@@ port fruit from a long distance ,
well ty@@ pic@@ ally from , you know , the west .
and so they did a lot of interesting fruit bre@@ eding , this is one of the pl@@ ants they bre@@ d in fact , and you know that has a parallel in that ... of course in the moment , as a country , you know , we im@@ port a lot of our food and there is no reason why we couldn 't , more or less ,
grow most of it here .
and of course that 's got to be sensible from our sust@@ ain@@ ability and our res@@ ili@@ ence aspec@@ ts , it 's got to be sensible and our govern@@ ments haven 't got it yet .
forest gar@@ dens are res@@ ili@@ ent because of the ... because of the diver@@ sity , really .
so , it 's diver@@ sity of structure so lots of different pl@@ ants at different level@@ s but also diver@@ sity of species , so this forest garden has about 550 species in it , which is probably more than most because i am doing a lot of research and experiment@@ ing as well ,
but , it 's very common for forest gar@@ dens to have 200 species and , you know , the major@@ ity of which would be food pl@@ ants you know which ... to ask when we 're used to , you know , eating 20 types of veg@@ etab@@ les or something ,
you know if you 're talking about 200 types of food plant , people , initi@@ ally , might be slightly overwhel@@ med , but actually ...
i regard that as actually pro@@ ving much more normal than re@@ lying on 20 you know i think ... if you look at if you look at our near relat@@ ives , things like or@@ ang@@ ut@@ ans they regular@@ ly eat 400 different types of le@@ af and fruit ,
they know everyone , they recognize every one , you know they know exactly what they are picking that 's no reason we couldn 't do the same .
and i susp@@ ect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more res@@ ili@@ ent people as well .
bam@@ bo@@ os are fantast@@ ically use@@ ful pl@@ ants and of course in china and japan or other parts of asia they use bam@@ bo@@ o for more things that you could think of .
this one is growing about 20 cm a day at the moment , because of this warm weather so ... and you can actually hear them growing , bam@@ bo@@ os are the only pl@@ ants i can claim to have heard growing because when it 's growing that fast and you put your ear near the top
you can hear the fi@@ bers un@@ fur@@ ling and cr@@ ack@@ ling away .
so , if i just cut the top of that , and cut it down in the middle , it 's very interesting inside , you 'll see ... you can see what are going to be the no@@ des which are these bits on the bam@@ bo@@ o cane
and everything inside this white or light green is edi@@ ble , so you pe@@ el of the ou@@ ter leaves and then the inside bit is edi@@ ble you normally steam that ... just steam it for 5 or 10 minutes and then ... because they 're normally bitter raw .
this garden is now 16 years old and ... i 've certainly seen i 've seen clim@@ ate changes in that time main@@ ly , you know , increas@@ ed aver@@ age temper@@ atures and fe@@ wer spring fro@@ sts .
dry springs is something that most far@@ mers hate because they 've just sa@@ wed all their spring cro@@ ps , or hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ ists for that matter , you know , and dry weather is just what they don 't want in spring so that can be quite sever@@ e in ter@@ ms of growing ann@@ ual pl@@ ants
so , you know , obviously if you 're growing per@@ en@@ ni@@ al pl@@ ants a dry spring is , more or less ir@@ relev@@ ant you know , won 't have very much effect at all and simil@@ arly , you know , extre@@ mes of weather at other times of year are gon@@ na have much less effect
on per@@ en@@ ni@@ al cro@@ ps than on annu@@ als as a rule .
fung@@ i are probably the most important organis@@ ms of all in this forest garden , and of course most of the time we don 't see it because they are under the so@@ il surface and ... the fung@@ i i am talking about are my@@ cor@@ r@@ hiz@@ al fung@@ i
which are benefici@@ al fung@@ i that form relation@@ ships with almost all plant ro@@ ots .
and they do some amazing things :
when they form an association with plant ro@@ ots they bas@@ ically give the plant hard to get nu@@ tri@@ ents because fung@@ i can get those out of the ground much more eff@@ ici@@ ently than pl@@ ants and the plant gives the fung@@ i some su@@ gar@@ s in return , so it 's kind of sym@@ bio@@ sis .
but they do other things as well , they protect the plant from dis@@ eas@@ es and ... they move nu@@ tri@@ ents around in natural eco@@ systems and in something like a forest garden if there is more nu@@ tri@@ ents of one sort in one part of the so@@ il
and a lack in another part of the so@@ il , this fung@@ i will move it , physic@@ ally move it from one place to another and then the tree in another place will use it .
so that 's how things like nitro@@ gen from my nitro@@ gen fix@@ ing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fung@@ i move it for you .
the other thing that this fung@@ i do , which has really just been discovered in the last few years is crit@@ ical in se@@ quest@@ ering carbon in stable states in the so@@ il .
so without them you wouldn 't get se@@ quest@@ r@@ ation into the so@@ il .
and of course you don 't get these fung@@ i where you dig the so@@ il .
and this huge potential you know for se@@ quest@@ ering more carbon into the so@@ il you know ... and certainly you know , everybody seems to want to do that but ... but to do that , you gon@@ na have to move to a much more per@@ en@@ ni@@ al system .
this is po@@ ker@@ o@@ ot which is a quite a well known american wild edi@@ ble .
we@@ edy sho@@ ots that come through which tend to be at the beginning of june so it 's kind of very late spring cro@@ p really and the sho@@ ots come as really thick like you can see here .
you cook those and they have a sort of heal@@ thy as@@ parag@@ us flav@@ or to them really , really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al veget@@ able .
but pois@@ on@@ ous when it 's raw , you know , so you have to cook it but there 's lots of pl@@ ants you know that we eat have little po@@ ison in one state or another otherwise i think if po@@ tat@@ o@@ es were discovered now they probably wouldn 't be allowed in this country
because you know green po@@ tat@@ o@@ es are quite pois@@ on@@ ous .
i mean my estim@@ ate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden .
i use a lot of arom@@ atic pl@@ ants down in my per@@ en@@ ni@@ al lay@@ ers so a lot of different side sau@@ ce of min@@ t for ex@@ ample and lem@@ on bal@@ m or o@@ reg@@ ano , and other her@@ bs some of which of course is har@@ vest@@ ed but ,
it 's doing some use@@ ful func@@ tions that 's some use@@ ful func@@ tions even if you don 't har@@ v@@ est it down this layer because you know they are rich in essenti@@ al o@@ ils , min@@ ts and other arom@@ atic pl@@ ants and essenti@@ al o@@ ils are anti bacter@@ ial and anti fung@@ al so having those in the under@@ story lay@@ ers should have a protec@@ tive effect you know for other pl@@ ants in term of reduc@@ ing bacter@@ ial dis@@ eas@@ es and fung@@ al dis@@ eas@@ es .
the med@@ lar is a fantast@@ ic fruit tree which a lot of people don 't know but you can see the young fruits here these grow to about 3-@@ 3.5 centi@@ met@@ ers diam@@ eter and ri@@ pen on the tree in warm sum@@ mers otherwise you pick them
at the first frost and taken in@@ doors and then they ri@@ pe in with are sort of very sweet sort of date , bak@@ ed apple type flav@@ or to them really nice edi@@ ble fruit ... and also , you know , again very low mainten@@ ance it doesn 't have any pest@@ s or dis@@ eas@@ es it just looks after itself .
mon@@ ocul@@ ture cro@@ ps have been domin@@ ating all agriculture research for hund@@ reds of years and even now you know ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am agriculture scienti@@ sts they don 't like looking at more than one cro@@ p in one place , it makes things very complic@@ ated for them .
this is si@@ chuan pe@@ pper which is obviously a commercial cro@@ p grown in china main@@ ly but it 's a shr@@ ub as you can see a lar@@ gel@@ y shr@@ ub and you can see it has just finished flo@@ wering it 's just starting to form the pep@@ per@@ cor@@ ns here
and each of those will form a ro@@ un@@ dish fruit so the black se@@ ed in the middle and a sort of pink shell round the outside .
it 's actually that pink shell which is the sp@@ ice you don 't have to use black pe@@ pper if you have something like this .
welcome to the new afrika shr@@ ine .

and it looks like many of them feel part of this place , feel like this is their home .
they feel like my life revol@@ ves around their life , they feel like they 're part of what 's going on here .

so that i have no secrets when i am writing a song .

sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan
they enjoyed it , especially during sunday jump .
did you see how full it was ?
everybody was happy , enjoying themselves , and jum@@ ping and everything , which is good .
and then they relax , you know ?
because in nigeria , life is not easy for anyone .
cost of living , there 's no lights , no water , the scho@@ ols are poor ...
it 's not easy .
the sal@@ aries aren 't paid , pen@@ sions aren 't paid , so everything isn 't going smooth@@ ly .
we want to have somewhere you can sit , forget everything , go there for some time . i think it 's great .
fem@@ i 's doing a lot for them that way .
that 's another way of getting to the people .
if he contin@@ ues like that , there 's no trouble .
there 's no trouble in the shr@@ ine when he 's there .
everything 's cool and organiz@@ ed .
wh@@ ere@@ as with fe@@ la , it was tou@@ gh .
there were always problems there .
there were always problems .
education doesn 't work , hospit@@ als don 't work proper@@ ly , people are poor , police aren 't paid ...
i mean , no security , life is totally a mess here .
the papers tell us a different story from the reality of our lives .
a lot of people are in pain here now .
even me , i 'm comfortable , but when you see so much po@@ ver@@ ty , how can you be happy ?
after 40 years of indepen@@ dence , there is no area in nigeria where you have light constant@@ ly , water running constant@@ ly .
and we call our@@ selves independent ?
indepen@@ dence means you 're independent of asking for fav@@ ors .
we can 't say we are independent , because we are still re@@ lying on many things to keep our country going .
i wan@@ na be free from all these yeye polit@@ ics
i wan@@ na be free from all these yeye polit@@ ici@@ ans
i wan@@ na be free from all these corrup@@ t mon@@ sters
because of the ide@@ als of fem@@ i an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti , he has always found a positive way to project the black man .
we believe in black power , and that we can be trust@@ ed .
we want to con@@ vey that afric@@ ans can mind themselves proper@@ ly .
we want to do away with the my@@ ths in black ment@@ ality that the black man can 't do what he wants to ach@@ ie@@ ve .
we 're trying to say things can work in africa , if our lead@@ ers do the right thing .
but most of all , if no one can do that , we should free our@@ selves .
i think that fem@@ i has found a better way to project this and continue fe@@ la 's hope to project the black image right .
to try to cre@@ ate another way to see that things can work in black africa .
i wan@@ na be free from all these corrup@@ t mon@@ sters
we@@ y want to cho@@ p man
the king is dead
na dem ko@@ oku@@ ma kill the king for polit@@ ical reasons
dem no fit talk as e be
oya back to polit@@ ics
dem start to sch@@ eme for the same corrup@@ tion and thie@@ f
no plan for you and me
when we de@@ y sleep
de@@ y dem de@@ y meet to plan their evil strategi@@ es
to control our re@@ sources
african lead@@ ers
and their foreign counter@@ parts
e bi like from these evil mon@@ sters
we shall never be free
i wan@@ na be free i said every day
every night
i ask myself
why , why , why
chee because fe@@ la die
that is why dem de@@ y try to
conf@@ use i and everybody mind
last sunday , i had my ber@@ et .
it was stol@@ en today .
what do they want ?
- they st@@ ole my ber@@ et .
- sanc@@ tion@@ ed .
what do you mean , sanc@@ tion@@ ed ?
i told you they st@@ ole it !
did you hear him ?
i lent mine to him , over there .
they only gave me the shirt .
is@@ oko , anyone give you a ber@@ et ?
he said he doesn 't have it .
i 'm wearing michael 's ber@@ et .
i had a ber@@ et , last week .
each time we go out in this uniform we hear people y@@ ell :
" fem@@ i 's child ! "
or " the shr@@ ine boys ! "
they do recognize us as one of the " shr@@ ine boys . "
fe@@ la , himself has already made the shr@@ ine popular for all the afric@@ ans .
so when his son took over for him , people respect him like they respec@@ ted his father .
when we put on this uniform we look as if we 're close to fem@@ i .
it 's hard for people to see fem@@ i , so when we wear this uniform , they say " this is fem@@ i 's security . "
that 's why we 're proud to wear this uniform .
i 'm proud to be working at the shr@@ ine , i 'll always be proud .
when i 'm going home , a polic@@ eman will ask me :
" where are you coming from at this hour of the night ? "
i tell him i 'm working security at the shr@@ ine .
he asks if i have my id card ,
i tell him i don 't have one .
this is the symbol of where i work .
as long as they can see this , they know that i work for fem@@ i .
so they allow me to go .
if dem want to hear we go tell them plenty things
if dem want to see we go show them many things
we@@ y the african man we@@ y the african woman
find it very difficult to succe@@ ed
na today dem no say mu@@ bo@@ tu no good
she na today dem no say company no good
see this african lead@@ ers
dem don kill all their people finish
look again o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo don kill nig@@ eri@@ ans
no not o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo and his p@@ adi pad@@ dies
dem de@@ y try to give us different reason
to tell us say o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo no guilty

na today dem no say mu@@ gabe no good
my son omor@@ im@@ ade af@@ ol@@ abi an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti
see those african lead@@ ers rol@@ ari
dem don kill all their people finish
as we ou@@ ght to know the reason why
the african man and the african woman find it difficult to su ... su ...
because you like to drink beer too much !
you like to su@@ ck bre@@ asts too much !
you 'd like to be su@@ cking pus@@ sy too much !
... succe@@ ed !
with the dancing ... with the dancing , the anger , the suff@@ ering you still find joy and peace .
we 're letting so much frustration out of our system .
and all that is a language , without talking .
there is communication on that . i go to sleep ,
i can wake up the next day , move forward without stress .
if my body 's aching me or my girlfriend or ...
why do we need to have stress ?
and i hope the people who come here have that same kind of vi@@ be .
i mean , what is life ?
to have peace of mind , know what to do the next day , how to deal with life .
so if the shr@@ ine can do that to everybody , or any@@ body , i won 't call it a church or mos@@ que ,
i 'll just say it 's life , shr@@ ine .
i won 't say god is here , god is not . god is here , but he 's everywhere .
i will not go under the um@@ bre@@ lla of religion , i 'll make it spiritu@@ al . it 's limit@@ less .
i will not say :
" this is where to be , " but " at least you can be . "
key@@ board !
yeah , i play the base guitar .
i dance .
he pl@@ ays guitar .
i dance on stage .
i play the trum@@ pet .
i play the shak@@ ers .
i 'm a per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist .
this is the band leader !
if i can take this country , then africa is settled .
once there 's a good government in 1 country , they 'll be liber@@ ated .
only one straight , progres@@ sive clean government that knows what it 's doing .
no diplom@@ acy , no comprom@@ ises ,
and no marx@@ is@@ m-@@ len@@ in@@ ism , no capit@@ alism .
afric@@ an@@ ism !

music is the way for us . music is the thing of the future .
music is the weapon of the future .
fem@@ i takes care of everybody , street boys , everybody .
we live okay here .
in nigeria , only fem@@ i takes care of everybody .
he 's concerned about po@@ ver@@ ty , concerned about corrup@@ tion , the poor ...
in nigeria he 's a great man , fem@@ i an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti , and he did many songs to let people know
so we have a lot of music to let you know what is going on in nigeria and africa .
fem@@ i 's making people know , and wants to know more .
if you want to know more , come to the shr@@ ine .
that 's all .
he 's like a proph@@ et who has come to make people realize ...
he 's a proph@@ et who makes people realize that they must fight for their rights , like one of his best tracks , demo@@ crazy .
and now we realize that the government makes us mad , when you get mad , that 's sho@@ tan .
sho@@ tan , it 's like the destruc@@ tive kid the mother didn 't want to have .
that 's what our government made us be .
but thank god , we have the shr@@ ine , we have surviv@@ al .
and we are ready to serve the true proph@@ et .
- not true ?
- it 's true !
we do something for our@@ selves !
we want to move further ,
we want to go to university !
but our presi@@ dents only watch themselves , rule themselves . and the country 's getting worse and worse .
pr@@ ices always go up , food , people are dying !
food pr@@ ices .
no light , no good education , no good nothing !
mr. president , we 're beg@@ ging you !
we fight for our rights , man !
we 're fighting together , doing something for our@@ selves !
for our@@ selves , for our lives !
fem@@ i ku@@ ti tells us how to think for our@@ selves .
because some people are milli@@ on@@ aires , while the country is going bad , bad !
the frustration is too much .
sometimes when i 'm walking i see the polic@@ em@@ en beat people like dogs .
the polic@@ em@@ en beat us like dogs .
not true ?
it 's true , man !
the afrika shr@@ ine be my neighbor@@ hood
every night , i 'm there at afrika shr@@ ine
the ladies do as they like at the shr@@ ine
everybody does as they like at the shr@@ ine
every night they meet at the afrika shr@@ ine
neighbor@@ hood
all afric@@ ans are my neighbor@@ s
the ladies like my neighbor@@ hood
the man we call fem@@ i is a proph@@ et .
we all serve him .
he 's given us the message to keep the place clean .
we make sure it 's clean .
we have found a survi@@ vor , we are pleased with him .
we are happy .
we are people from places like aj@@ eg@@ un@@ le and mus@@ hin , places where people go without eating .
we 're here , we found surviv@@ al with him .
we serve him .
that 's why this place is clean .
if i leave for 5 minutes , this place will be mes@@ sed up .
i must be here to make sure this place is clean .
so he 'll be pleased with me , and i 'll be happy he 's pleased .
bring me
bring me the man now
i believe right now there 's so much energy here .
and you can manipul@@ ate this energy for you .
my role is taking the energy of music and trans@@ forming it into dance .
if i ach@@ ie@@ ve that , it 's a force .
music is a powerful force .
i take that sound , truly , not tr@@ ick@@ ery or lies .
i take that energy and go po@@ w ...
and make people really go crazy .
how ?
it 's magic .
people ask me how i did it , i don 't know .
because i do the right thing , that energy is using me as a medium to express many things through music .
now that energy is a constant thing , 24 hours a day .
you can use that energy to understand , for many things .
say you have a head@@ ache , somebody will be able to just touch your head , you 'll feel a kind of ease because of the true love .
you take the energy : " you have a head@@ ache ? where ? "
and that person will have calm .
i beg live me
no distur@@ b me with non@@ sense g@@ ist
the fine things of life these people don 't see
their bad mind no gree make dem get better dream
with their cro@@ ok@@ ed legs dem wal@@ ka go re@@ dem
but salv@@ ation comes from within
se@@ ek and ye shall find
definitely with music
whose rich harmon@@ ies and melo@@ dies
will truly bring peace
all in the name of peace
we fight and kill to find justice
for me na only music
from the voice of the soul we speak
wet@@ in concern me with english
na dem ko@@ ko gre@@ edy dem sel@@ fish
my sisters
they bank africa money like the s@@ wis@@ s
oy@@ in@@ bo don kill africa finish
fem@@ i , don 't go !
the son of fe@@ la " baba 70 . "
don 't go !
i think it 's the most challen@@ ging place to compose .
if the shr@@ ine people love it , then i 'm not worried , really .
i 'm not really worried , because i 'm very crit@@ ical of myself . if i don 't like it , if i don 't feel something , i will not continue the work .
after the comple@@ tion of the shr@@ ine ,
i found that i was alone , and i just saw myself sin@@ king deep into music .
and on getting where i am in life , i found that the only friend i have , the only thing i can trust , is myself .
and it 's difficult to really trust yourself .
you don 't want to do something , then you do it .
the only thing i have confidence in , in my life , 100 % , is music .
even if you don 't give your life to music , music will take you over .
so , i just let myself go and wh@@ er@@ ever music takes me , so be it .
i have no wor@@ ries concer@@ ning that .
i 'm not sad .
i mean , i have peace .
sometimes i look anno@@ yed , it 's things around me , or things people said . i am a very happy man , very happy .
sometimes i love being alone , i love being in my own world because this world is crazy .
i don 't see anything in this world that makes sense .
you pre@@ fer to be alone ?
i feel saf@@ er that way .
don 't forget , i 'm not alone in that respect .
i have the force of music , running like a wild fo@@ un@@ tain in my head .
that alone , i am never at peace .
and i love the feeling music gives me .
i 'll never com@@ promise that , for nothing in this world .
nothing .
not even myself .
i will star@@ ve myself for music .
no way , can never give it up .
out of the way !
calm down !
out of the way !
may your future be bright !
everywhere i go i see in@@ justice

but when the spot@@ light is on you and you 've got your nut@@ s in a vise , the only thing that matters is getting the fuck out .
escape is a state of mind .
and there 's no prison that fit@@ zy can 't break out of .
no way !
me@@ gh@@ an ?
f@@ itz ?
fuck .
where the fuck 's hou@@ dini when you need him ?
oh , for the love of fuck , it 's coming !
don 't worry , miss devon , we will get you to the hospital safe and sound and in time to wit@@ ness this beautiful , mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous ....
i need mother@@ fucking drug@@ s .
i got some met@@ h , but it 's prison met@@ h .
i got has@@ h , and ox@@ y con@@ tin .
ox@@ y ?
i could use a hit .
get in line .
you 're fucking kid@@ ding me .
half@@ si@@ es ?
i 'm the one in lab@@ our .
try to hold off having the kid in the car , will ya ?
it 'll st@@ ain the leather and kill the re-@@ sale value .
w@@ hoa !
what the fuck are you doing ?
fuck , you don 't have to have it in the dit@@ ch !
oh , i 'm not .
get out !
what the hell did i do ?
what haven 't you done !
you 're un@@ emplo@@ yed , you 've never made it to any of the doctor 's ap@@ point@@ ments , you 're never around !
i broke out of prison !
for you !
when have you ever done anything in your life for anyone but yourself ?
okay , food for thought .
and since richard is an escaped convic@@ t , maybe we can pon@@ der this on the road .
let 's - can we get a move on , please ?
you shut the fuck up !
i will not let you s@@ me@@ ar your fail@@ ure all over this baby .
get out of my life , you fucking loser !
hey !
hey !
fuck !
richard !
don 't leave me here with this crazy broad !
oh god !
richard !
richard , i know this is a trying time for us , but it 's also an excellent opportunity to dig deep , and find out what 's really going on here .
huh ?
breathe !
breathe !
no , really , what 's going on here ?
she thinks i 'm a loser !
no , i doubt that 's true .
did you hear me , f@@ itz ?
you 're a fu@@ ck@@ in ' loser !
i can 't have my fucking kid thinking his old man is a loser !
let 's work on this in the car !
i have to get the de@@ aler@@ ship back from those two car@@ bom@@ b-@@ istan@@ is .
let 's figure out how to pay for that in the car !
you get her to the hospital , i 'll take care of the de@@ aler@@ ship .
and ev@@ ade the police ?
i 'll call you in an hour .
two hours .
oh !
that 's right !
drive !
find the clo@@ s@@ est mo@@ tel !
oh , i can handle this .
i don 't need him .
i 've been through worse .
i told you the kid was a loser .
he 's actually a win@@ ner now , sir .
richard has decided to make the baby proud , and buy back the de@@ aler@@ ship .
the de@@ aler@@ ship ?
ye@@ p .
over my dead body !
you said you didn 't want it .
first rule of business :
lie .
you should be proud too , ali , because you and the baby are having a positive effect on the fitz@@ patr@@ icks .
hey !
hey !
it 's true .
oh ...
what are you doing !
hey !
that 's my truck , man !
you can 't keep me here , you know .
this is a men 's prison .
i 'm a woman .
it is clearly a viol@@ ation of the , uh ...
geneva convention .
and if i actually get viol@@ ated , that 's another viol@@ ation .
so let me take a wild guess ...
you just happened to be in the neigh@@ bour@@ hood on the night that your brother and father broke out of ja@@ il ?
no , stupid !
i was here because my stupid brother 's stupid girlfriend was in stupid lab@@ our , so ...
she is ?
where did they take her ?
what can you do for me ?
i 'm up on ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ ion charges because of my dad 's church s@@ cam ...
i want immun@@ ity .
by the power invest@@ ed in me by the town of cover@@ ton , i now declare you not guilty , okay ?
they were headed back into town .
daddy and richard were fighting about the de@@ aler@@ ship ,
ali was all like , " i 'm hav@@ in ' a baby , i 'm a fu@@ ck@@ in ' idiot ! , " so ...
thank you .
okay .
ar@@ rest her .
what ?
aid@@ ing and ab@@ et@@ ting escaped prison@@ ers .
you can 't do that !
put me down !
what the fuck !
gentlem@@ en ...

well , it would appear we are in the mid@@ st of a mexic@@ an stand@@ -@@ off .
i black@@ ma@@ iled el@@ aine fitz@@ patrick for her shar@@ es in this de@@ aler@@ ship .
you think i 'm scared of you ?

my life is a little complic@@ ated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chand@@ ler murray .
the only problem , they think i 'm an adult .
now i am jug@@ g@@ ling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she 's a little sh@@ ady .
i 'm afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you 're happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fel@@ las .
here 's how it 's going down .
are you rob@@ bing this place , tommy ?
let 's go !
let 's go !
a couple months at new hall youth deten@@ tion might give mr. nut@@ ter ample time to think about those mist@@ akes and their implic@@ ations .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , jan@@ ey .
it 's not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don 't .
i can 't talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i 'm just gon@@ na say it .
it 's you , jan@@ ey .
jane .
jane !
let 's go .
you 're gon@@ na be late for school again , tru@@ ant .
that gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ or of yours is gon@@ na come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
ben .
it 's a little weird that you call your girlfriend " miss shaw . "
oh , you mean rita .
hey .
are you really that busy ?
yes .
and no .
i 'm nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy 's different ?
what if he doesn 't want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juven@@ ile deten@@ tion center , not a br@@ ain@@ wash@@ ing camp .
you 'll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i 'm waiting .
bat@@ ed breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , " it 's you . "
- it 's you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn 't know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it 's been playing on a lo@@ op in my head .
" it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . " what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-@@ base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romant@@ ically ?
no .
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don 't think that 's it .
but i guess it can be .
i don 't know .
maybe it is .
i don 't know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he 's my best friend and i don 't want to run the risk of ru@@ in@@ ing that , right ?
- i can 't answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , jan@@ ey .

i 'm just surprised .
that 's all .
this progress report does not refle@@ ct the acade@@ mic performance of the jane quim@@ by that i know .
your gr@@ ades are sli@@ pping in every class but ceram@@ ics .
well , that 's good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceram@@ ics .
- ou@@ ch .
and it 's not just your gr@@ ades .
your atten@@ dance last month ?
let 's just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
this intern@@ ship is interfer@@ ing with your life .
your gr@@ ades aren 't what they used to be , you have multiple tar@@ dies and ab@@ sen@@ ces and that just can 't happen .
i know , i know .
but i 'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i 'm already here .
this is my life .
it 's just an intern@@ ship , jane .
it 's not .
i 'm working with design@@ ers and i 'm being ex@@ posed to this whole world of fashion that you can 't learn in a class@@ room .
i 'm living it every day .
you can 't buy that kind of experience , you know ?
fine .
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn 't im@@ prove , i can 't sign off on the intern@@ ship program for you next sem@@ ester .
especially if you 're not ...
wait .
are you tex@@ ting someone right now ?
uh , what ?
no .
i am just ty@@ ping a remin@@ der to myself to shape up at school .
st@@ at .
i promise i 'll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
sorry .
i know this might sound har@@ sh , but you 've been an incredi@@ ble disap@@ pointment , sally .
it 's suz@@ y .
your work has been l@@ ack@@ lu@@ ster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er , you 've yet to show any real promise .
but i 've only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i 'm afraid .
you 're fired .
that 'll be all .
what ?
that 's five this month , gray .
well , it 's been harder to re@@ place india than i might 've realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i 'm not worried .
i have a new prosp@@ ect in mind .
someone young and un@@ expected .
someone not box@@ ed in by years of design experience .
you don 't mean ...
you 're not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next ap@@ pointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
marty@@ n !
gray , darling !
so . classic .
clean .
powerful .
it 's a whole new del@@ icious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i 'm afraid i don 't .
i love it .
you 're a gen@@ ius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hat@@ s does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that 's twice as busy since india left ?
i think we 're all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
'@@ cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , " over whom ? " and , " in pum@@ ps or flat@@ s ? "
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don 't get your ho@@ pes up .
hey .
what can i do for you , mu@@ ff@@ in ?
that 's a " no " on kissing at work and the whole mu@@ ff@@ in thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn 't quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we 're on the same page .
so , what 's up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i 'm just a little concerned .
don 't worry .
she 's good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i 'm concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she 's falling behind .
i think this intern@@ ship is just too demand@@ ing on her , don 't you ?
actually , i kind of think it 's been good .
but i promise i 'll make sure she st@@ ays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depen@@ ds on it ?
b@@ ingo .
i know you 've all been working tre@@ mendo@@ usly hard lat@@ ely .
but you 're gon@@ na have to work tre@@ mendo@@ usly harder .
don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er has been selec@@ ted to collabor@@ ate on a cap@@ s@@ ule collection with one of the world 's most famous lux@@ ury department sto@@ res ,
har@@ ro@@ ds .
that is , unless we blow it .
and we can@@ not blow it .
understood ?
okay .
didn 't i fire you ?
no .
oh .
see me in my office after@@ wards .
the style director as@@ signed to over@@ see our har@@ ro@@ ds collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one prior@@ ity ?
carter ?
um , to im@@ press the style director and en@@ sure har@@ ro@@ ds is confid@@ ent that don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er has what it takes ?
precis@@ ely .
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no excep@@ tions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
now .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn 't see .
because apparently , we 're all supposed to be working tre@@ mendo@@ usly harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suz@@ y ?
- right .
oh , my gos@@ h .
i 'm turning into gray , aren 't i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i 'm going to tell you something and i need you not to re@@ act , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i 'm serious , jane .
okay .
gray is giving you india 's old job .
what ?
me ?
no reaction .
right .
take over india 's job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
jan@@ ey ?
you ready ?
almost !
i 'll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind hand@@ ing me the milk ?
yes .
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your to@@ ast is ready .
wait .
you 're actually considering this ?
no .
yes ?
i don 't know .
i mean , taking india 's old job would be the opportunity of a life@@ time .
how could i say no ?
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you 'd really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
maybe .
why ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i 'm good .
oh , you 're good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
whatever .
- so , now you 're mad at me ?
yeah .
i am .
billy , you 've been shut@@ ting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won 't even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for star@@ ters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , jan@@ ey .
nothing ?
that 's your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that 's it .
there 's nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i 'm different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it 's not for the better .
i didn 't ask you , jane .
fine !
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don 't know , ben .
maybe i took your ad@@ vice and i tried to talk to him about the whole " it 's you " thing and maybe it back@@ fired .
sorry about that .
i 'm worried about billy .
it can 't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don 't know , maybe an activit@@ y or something ?
like math@@ le@@ tes .
or ch@@ ess club .
- i 'm being serious , rita .
- so am i .
come on .
ch@@ ess ?
math@@ le@@ tes ?
what , do you want him to be more of an out@@ cast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were ador@@ able doing it .
shoot .
vice principal jen@@ kins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what 're you nau@@ gh@@ ty kids up to this fine morning ?
nau@@ gh@@ ty ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said " mo@@ p " !
- and i 'll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jen@@ kins .
good morning , rita .
and ...
ben .
that was close .
no .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what 's gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kid@@ ding ?
we o@@ oz@@ e chem@@ ist@@ ry .
don 't say o@@ oz@@ e .
hi .
hi .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bear@@ ings back .
- that 's good .
- ye@@ p .
so , what 's been going on with you ?
sorry .
stupid question .
so , you and fad@@ den , huh ?
how 's that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you 're precipit@@ ating .
- excuse me ?
- your cal@@ cium is starting to form a precipit@@ ate .
you should dry out the cryst@@ als .
oh .
um ...
thanks .
- busy , huh ?
- mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
you 're not gon@@ na cut me any sl@@ ack here , are you ?
maybe .
but just a little .
okay .
i guess i deserve that .
i 'm really sorry , jane .
for what it 's worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it 's fine .
really , i 'm just distr@@ acted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and l@@ ulu seem very happy .
yeah .
the thing is ...
i ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
oh .
yeah .
thanks .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
thanks .
first day back .
how 're you doing ?
i 'm fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i 'm adjust@@ ing .
no , i just thought now that you 're back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive out@@ let .
for what ?
i don 't know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
such as ...
how about football ?
seriously ?
yeah .
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you 're a little str@@ ing@@ y , but you 're probably very el@@ us@@ ive .
hard to t@@ ack@@ le .
baseball ?
oh , my .
are you kid@@ ding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help re@@ ac@@ clim@@ ate me or whatever it is that you 're trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not really the team sport type .
are you sure you 're doing okay ?
i 'm fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i 'd like to .
- i 'd pre@@ fer if we didn 't .
excuse me .
coming through .
i have to leave school because of an emergen@@ cy at work and rita can 't know under any circum@@ stances because then i would lose my intern@@ ship and that can 't happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don 't think so .
- no way .
what ?
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don 't really like to do this sort of thing , but can 't you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cr@@ amp@@ s , anything .
i don 't like lying to rita .
it 's just a teen@@ y-@@ tiny little white lie .
and that 's how it all starts .
that 's correct .
fine .
i don 't need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
o@@ ops .
sorry .
sorry .
that 's okay .
hey , i 'm actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you deli@@ vering those to ?
you think i 'm a flower deli@@ very guy ?
i did .
a second ago .
but now i 'm a little un@@ sure .
they 're for gray chand@@ ler murray .
oh . great .
i 'm gray 's assistant .
jane .
so i can just take those to her .
i 'd rather give them to her myself if that 's okay .
the thing is gray 's not exactly the hand deli@@ very type .
what type is she ?
she 's more of a " don 't bother me with that kind of crap " type .
so , if you 're not the flower deli@@ very guy , who are you ?
eli .
i have an ap@@ pointment with gray .
today ?
no , it 's tomorrow .
i just thought i 'd get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn 't laugh .
well , it wasn 't laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn 't have any ap@@ point@@ ments today .
well , she called me directly .
gray ?
called you ?
on the phone ?
yeah .
crazy , right ?
so , what is this ap@@ pointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you 're inter@@ vie@@ wing for it ?
yeah .
are you gon@@ na point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gos@@ h .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
tips ?
yeah , you know , like ad@@ vice for the interview .
oh , um , just don 't take anything gray says to you person@@ ally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you 're saying she 's mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she 's just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you 're here !
oh !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven 't seen you in a while .
and i know lili@@ es are your favorite .
jane , i see you 've met my neph@@ ew , eli .
yeah , we ...
neph@@ ew ?
yeah .
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you 're warm and gorgeous and incredi@@ bly tal@@ ent@@ ed .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
neph@@ ew ?
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don 't like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray 's neph@@ ew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india 's new re@@ placement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
no .
i ...
sp@@ it it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india 's job .
you are .
where 's jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her depar@@ ture .
what 'd she say ?
she said some things about cr@@ amp@@ s .
cr@@ amp@@ s .
cr@@ amp@@ s . you know , lady stuff .
i 'm not that familiar with lady stuff , so i 'd really rather not discus@@ s it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she 'll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-@@ caf@@ f lat@@ te .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reserv@@ ation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were book@@ ed up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some str@@ ings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what 's this ?
- some sket@@ ches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the acces@@ sor@@ ies line .
i 'll take a look .
impres@@ sive .
you 're still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that 's nice .
hey .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
techn@@ ically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there 's no such thing .
okay , come on , i 'm serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quim@@ by .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it 's a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i 'm an assistant .
and the clo@@ s@@ est i 've come to stud@@ ying design is , i don 't know , the end@@ less hours i spent and fashion magaz@@ ines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more quali@@ fied and he 's ...
he 's nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you 've got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
thank you .
i just really don 't know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insan@@ e ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he 's back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn 't he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we 've talked about this .
you 're my men@@ tor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to ru@@ b it in .
all i 'm saying is i don 't know if it 's the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i 'm not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it 's nothing .
sorry .
thank you .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're welcome .
sup ?
wow !
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what 's going on with you ?
i was par@@ ched .
you 're avo@@ iding me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm trying to keep things discre@@ et .
between us .
you know ?
you 're lying to me about jane .
what ?
no .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cr@@ amp@@ s .
did not .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you 've got me really worried about these cold cr@@ amp@@ s .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going with you .
and if jane isn 't home sick in bed , that intern@@ ship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
now !
- what happened ?
the collec@@ tive brain power of you and me .
that 's what happened .
you said cr@@ amp@@ s , didn 't you ?
there 's no time for blame .
yes . i said cr@@ amp@@ s .
you just couldn 't stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she 's coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can 't you just call her ?
i 've called her like a dozen times .
it ke@@ eps going to vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail .
ben , it 's just the whole racing to save jane thing , it 's not really my problem anymore .
look .
i 'm not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us .
otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she 's my sister .
i can 't bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can 't com@@ pete with this guy .
trust me .
she 's not going to hire her neph@@ ew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn 't go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn 't exactly re@@ fin@@ ed like the rest of you extre@@ mely tal@@ ent@@ ed people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you 're already s@@ elling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i 'm just s@@ elling my stuff at po@@ p-@@ up sho@@ ps or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materi@@ als , but i love it .
and that 's what it 's all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he 's perfect .
he 's char@@ ming and tal@@ ent@@ ed and good@@ -@@ looking
he 's not that good@@ -@@ looking .
i 'm serious , jeremy .
there 's no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i 'm up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it 's a cour@@ tes@@ y , jane .
a family oblig@@ ation .
this is gray we 're talking about .
she 's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i 'm always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these pu@@ pp@@ ies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we 're going .
understood ?
understood .
and if i find out you are lying , we 're gon@@ na have a serious issue .
i 'm pleased to announ@@ ce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vac@@ an@@ cy left by india jour@@ da@@ in .
- it 's you .
- what ?
i 'm certain of it .
this person has pro@@ ven that they have excep@@ tional cre@@ ativ@@ ity and style .
this person is destin@@ ed to be a rising star here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er .
this person is ...
wait !
what , jane ?
i 'm sorry .
i just ...
i can 't .
can 't ?
i can 't do this .
i 'd like to take myself out of the running .
i 'm so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don 't think i 'm ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i 'm pleased to introdu@@ ce our ne@@ west designer ,
eli chand@@ ler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cr@@ amp@@ s , didn 't he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn 't think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your s@@ ick@@ bed .
what do you think 's faster right now ?
5@@ th or lex ?
we 're gon@@ na have to ...
you came for me .
i did .
and i 'm not gon@@ na let that be for nothing .
come on .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i 'm on my way to the house .
i 've stal@@ led as long as i can and i just can 't keep lying to rita .
your char@@ iot awa@@ its .
mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
drive .
now .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a short@@ cut .
- oh !
come on , jan@@ ey !
oh , wait .
paj@@ amas !
jane ?
jane ?
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i 'm feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cr@@ amp@@ s .
so i just needed to ...
double wh@@ am@@ my .
h@@ mm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i 'm sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole man@@ hunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for question@@ ing you , accus@@ ing you of lying .
i don 't know what got into me .
i think you 're just being the best gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ or in the history of gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ ors , that 's all .
thank you .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gos@@ h .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn 't even being offered ?
so embarras@@ sing .
it wasn 't so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad .
i coun@@ ted eight people cr@@ inging .
did you count me ?
okay .
nine .
i know you wanted that job .
honestly , i wasn 't ready to leave being a teen@@ ager behind just yet .
and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , jan@@ ey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you 'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , " it 's you , "
and i need to know if you meant ...
i meant
that it 's you , jan@@ ey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don 't want that to ever change .
because that 's what 's most important , right ?
yeah .
it is .
remember .
we must im@@ press this har@@ ro@@ ds style director at any cost .
don@@ o@@ van is depen@@ ding on us .
hello , lo@@ ser@@ s .
that 's right .
i 'm the one you 've been waiting for .
where 's jane ?

i remember that day ... happy times .
you are putting a bag in the car . what was it ?
probably f@@ ishing gear .
ba@@ x ?
quinn ?
tell me about this , please .
where did you learn how to do this ?
what is happening here ?
that 's ... that 's just lad@@ s on holiday , inn@@ it ?
you know , things get a bit out of control .
hello ?
who 's there ?
hello ?
who are you ?
where are my friends ?

yeah , i know that . but where ?
did they show you the pictures ?
what pictures ?
what do you say to ' em rick ? nothing .
obviously . don 't tell them anything , all right .
not until we get some kind of legal representation . someone from the em@@ bas@@ sy - am@@ nest@@ y or someone . how you gon@@ na get in touch with them ?
who are they anyway ?
they 're some kind of milit@@ ia or something , aren 't they ?
they knew we had that money . they picked us off . they 're probably using the money for some extre@@ m@@ ist movement .
he was wearing a shirt , with a marks and spencer 's label on . i saw it st@@ icking out .
who ? my inter@@ rog@@ ator . i mean , extre@@ mist@@ s ...
they might .
shall we go and help him ?
best not to get involved .
you all right , mate ?
it 's a woman . serious . it 's a bird !
ar@@ gh ! i was just trying to see if you were ok . i 'm quinn .
what sort of fa@@ g name is that ?
dun@@ no . ask my dad . named after my grand@@ father , i think .
i 'm mercedes . hi .
- your dad into cars then ?
- heard of the count of monte cristo , dum@@ b fuck ?
yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , i dun@@ no , i can 't remember .
can i just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
it 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want . who are they ?
a bunch of cock@@ su@@ ck@@ ers ! come on ! do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the british government ?
yeah , it 's easy . they 're in there . eh ?
what ?
it 's the foreign office . sorry . what is this place exactly ?
it 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
a week ago , i was standing in line , holding a tuna bag@@ u@@ ette , que@@ u@@ ing up for eas@@ y@@ jet . now i 'm being fucking ren@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed !

right . we should go en masse and dem@@ and to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here . there 's la@@ ws and proto@@ col@@ s ...
you think they 'll care about that ? they still have to ab@@ ide by them .
wo@@ ody , this is our government . govern@@ ments can 't just hold us inde@@ fin@@ it@@ ely for no reason . what you on about ?
course they can ! they do it all the time . you remember those plane spot@@ ters in gre@@ ece ?
they said they were sp@@ ies . and what about gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo ?
nobody even knew who was in there . get off ! come on !
all right ?
how did you end up here then , love ?
i was in kabul , " love . "
you in the army then ?
no , i went there because i like the opera .
didn 't like what i saw , so i went a@@ wo@@ l . took a long fucking walk . post@@ ed some things on the web .
secrets ? there are no secrets . only hidden tru@@ ths .
how long do they usually keep people in here for ? as long as they want . that 's the point .
fel@@ las , can i ... have a word ? in private .
this could be a trick . she could be working for them .
you not seen her face ?
what , you not talking to me now ?
i ain 't the enemy . anyway , if i wanted in@@ fo out of you , i 'd just .... .. beat it out of you .
ever had a ca@@ ulif@@ lower ear , quinn ? or a wet willy ?

tou@@ gh it out , guys ! you can get through this . you got each other for a start .
put our time to good use . only trying to help , kno@@ b@@ head . well , you 're not .
so , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , quinn ?
i don 't think anything , ba@@ x . because i 'm stuck in an il@@ legal prison in the middle of the sahara fucking desert . and why am i here ?
because you persu@@ aded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh . " i persu@@ aded you ? you called me .
i 've never called you , ba@@ x@@ ter . i 've never called you because i can@@ not bear your inc@@ es@@ sant mo@@ aning and compl@@ aining . oh , right , great - thanks .

i watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out . yeah , me too .
shit , no ... come on . let 's not think the worst .
hi@@ ya . i think there 's more gru@@ b on the side . just help yourself .
we 've been worried sick . you 've been gone all night . what happened ?
i dun@@ no ... weird . they asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and to@@ ast .
you should get some . come , please . oi !
sit .
fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
all we wanted to know was who you were finan@@ cing . we weren 't finan@@ cing anyone .
we were just trying to get home . with five million euros ?
we have at our dis@@ pos@@ al dna dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es , for@@ en@@ sic analy@@ sis , satellite imag@@ ing technology . if that doesn 't give us what we need , we emplo@@ y en@@ han@@ ced inter@@ rog@@ ation techniques .
if we want to find out the truth , we do . and now , we have .
we made a mistake . it happens . so ...
just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
hang on . does that mean that we can ... ? please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?

mrs peters . 101 bridge road , craw@@ ley . it 's my mum . just let her know i 'm all right .
you take care of yourself .
seriously ?
did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
two nights in . nah ... thought that was it .
what went through your mind ?
well , first of all , my kids ... carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ... i thought i 'd never get to see united play again .
i kept thinking of my kids . kept seeing their little faces . then i thought about nina ....
i wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what i 'm like . be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your por@@ no collection . nah , i don 't know .
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to sp@@ ain and actually ending up in mor@@ oc@@ co .
if anyone so much as men@@ tions " bad luck , " they 're walking . be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour . haven 't seen so much as a cam@@ el .
he 's gone .
he 's not coming back , is he ?
two stay , two go and get help . shouldn 't we all go ? why ?
or stay ? we 'll double our chances if we split . hal@@ ve them you mean .
i do . i do . i do .
i 'll go . come on . you two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
do you believe in destiny , ba@@ x ? no .
so shut up .
fate then ?
rick , please . no destiny , no fate , no karma , no sp@@ ells , no cur@@ ses .
this is just a series of mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings , ok ?
could have happened to any@@ body . no more , no less .
who 's ... ?
come on !
get in . you are about to be shot , get in !
ba@@ x , get in .
woods ! quinn ! hey !
- we had some distur@@ bing intel . - well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
i 'd like to know what 's going on , please . a co@@ vert department of the cia , the special activit@@ ies division has activ@@ ated a kill contr@@ act on you . sorry ?
what are you talking about ? evi@@ d@@ ently , you 've inter@@ sec@@ ted a line of nar@@ co-@@ finance and ... wait .
your man in major@@ ca ... .. has oper@@ ated succes@@ s@@ fully for so long because he gives huge kick@@ backs to the american security services . what ?
he 's pay@@ ing the cia to protect him ?
nar@@ co-@@ finance is a major reven@@ ue stream - for american black ops . - like a f@@ iv@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old , please .
not really new news . why would they want to kill us ?
one of you ti@@ pped off the author@@ ities in the uk . a contact inside custom@@ s and exc@@ ise .
your man here ret@@ ali@@ ated by telling the special activit@@ ies division you were about to blow their op wide open . so now they have to take you out . no , this ... this is crazy .
this goes higher than us . this kind of thing br@@ ings down govern@@ ments . iran contra anyone ?
which is why re@@ moving you is an easy piece of damage limit@@ ation . they can 't just shoot four blo@@ kes who just happened to go on holiday together . under the a@@ eg@@ is of " the global war on terror , " they can shoot anyone they like .
the cia ? no .
they 'd have t@@ asked local contr@@ ac@@ tors . so nothing can be lin@@ ked back to them . you got lucky ...
but this isn 't going to go away . ok , let 's get practic@@ al , then . so what are the op@@ tions ?
well , there must be something ?
right ... right - there may be a solution but we have to act now . like , this minute .
then i 'm afraid you 're on your own . how long would this be for ?
maybe for ever .
- we can never go home ?
- it 's the only offer on the table .
no , no , no , that 's ... that 's not an option .
no . i 'm going home and ... if you go back , you 'll be putting your famili@@ es at risk as well .
ok , let me just see if this is even logist@@ ically possible .
stand up . get up .
we can do it . we have a scramb@@ led phone link . you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circum@@ stances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
amy ... yeah , i know , i 'm sorry that i haven 't rung .
listen to me for a second , love . nina ... just stop , just let me talk , darling , ok ?
right ... there 's no easy way of saying this , ok , so i 'm just going to say it straight out . i 'm not coming back .
if i 've only got one call , which one do i call ? you can 't make me choose . i need you to phone my fol@@ ks ,
where are they ?
shit ... i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much ... i don 't know how long .
.. because that is not what 's happened . i 've met someone .
oh , amy ... please , just tell the kids , ok , that it 's not because of them , i 'm sorry nina .
no , no , everything 's fine . it 's just ... i think i 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
what ?
well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
i can 't hear you rachel , say that again .
take care ?
yeah , ok . i will . you too .
fuck ... no , no , you 're right , i 'm sorry , i know i shouldn 't swear . dad , listen to me , ok ?
you 've been brilli@@ ant , dad .
yeah , just take care . yeah ... i love you , dad .
i know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ? you think it 's my fault because i phon@@ ed the vat man .
it 's nobody 's fault , rick . it 's just ... i don 't know , the universe conspir@@ ing against us or something .
a fly saved my life . what ?
out in the desert . if it hadn 't been for that fly , i 'd have had my head blo@@ wn off . and the weird thing was , we 'd met before .
any idea where we 're going yet ?
is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
ba@@ x ?
what you going to call yourself ?
what do you mean ?
your name .
we can 't use our own names right ?
hey ... i 'm gon@@ na be floyd . that 's what i 'm gon@@ na call myself .
you can 't call yourself that . why ?
it 's a black name . is it ?
it 's like calling yourself ... everton or ty@@ rell , or something . you can 't .
tony smith . my name 's tony ... smith .
why can 't i be tony smith ? you call yourself whatever you like , mate . sir tony smith if you want , mate .
if i was a girl , i 'd call myself ... .. well , hope . you could be bob hope . new hope .
new house .
jamie .... jamie kirk , then . blake ...
tony smith , adam new@@ house , jamie kirk and ... .. blake hat@@ ch . hat@@ ch . welcome to your new fucking lives .
where are we ?
south africa .
we 're on the other side of the world . do they speak english here ?
uh ... i think so . what 's it like ?
i don 't know . this will all sort out , won 't it ?
eh ? a week from now , we 'll be in a pu@@ b in london , we 'll be laughing about this . some rand to get you through the first few weeks .
how do we get in touch with you ?
you don 't . right , ok . - how do we keep in touch ?
- you won 't be able to . it 's too dangerous . hang on a minute .
what happens if it 's safe for us , if it be@@ comes safe for us to go home , to break cover ? how will we know that ?
as far as anyone else knows now , you don 't ex@@ ist . that 's your best chance of survi@@ ving . if you want to stay alive , stay invisible .
the truth will come out though , won 't it ? in the end . ok , let 's go .
say your good@@ b@@ yes . come on , move this thing along . come on , people .
take care of your@@ selves .
wo@@ ody .
hey , we shouldn 't be on our own . listen , i know i said some things ... .. but you boys mean a lot to me , all right ? and you always will .
quinn , quinn , come on . guys , come on , we should stay together , yeah ? we 're a team now .
right , boys ... chin up . at least we 're still standing , eh ?
you 'll be all right , ba@@ x . what makes you say that ?
you 're smart . i 'm not that fucking smart .
good luck .
hey . what about if just me and him , we stick together ?
- it 'll be all right , won 't it ? - no . - listen , nobody has to know .
you 'll be all right . i can 't do this wo@@ ody . yes , you can .
you 're strong , mate . you 're stronger than you think . no , i 'm not .
woods , let 's not do it , yeah ? you and me , we 'll stay together , yeah ?
woods ... wo@@ ody ... wo@@ ody , let me go with you , yeah ?
please , wo@@ ody . wo@@ ody , let me come with you , please . hey !

i know every dis@@ grac@@ ed polit@@ ic@@ ian , every gem s@@ mug@@ gler , every high-@@ st@@ akes gamb@@ ler and gold dig@@ ger that come through those doors . why you never go away ?
you don 't even leave cape town . if you love her so much , why don 't you marry her ? yeah , why don 't you marry me and take me to england ?
your name isn 't new@@ house is it ?
how dare you , and how dare you try and black@@ mail me !
help !
previ@@ ously on siberia ... ( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting )
a tiger !
a fucking tiger !
i couldn 't believe it .
it was like something a seven year old would tell me ...
" oh , i saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- what are you doing ?
- wondering what would do that to a tiger .
oh , hell .
it 's on fire ...
and it 's green ...
- what 's on fire ?
- the sky .
you know , there 's something about carolina .
i feel like i recognize her .
- fire in the woods , man .
- ( man ) got to get some water .
i told you this was a mistake !
that 's all we had , man .
that 's all we had .
does anyone recognize this ?
we found johnny 's shirt .
and it was full of food from the shed .
( johnny ) i get what it looks like .
i see that .
but i didn 't ste@@ al the food , and i didn 't burn down the shed .
someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
people weren 't taking too kin@@ dly me being at camp ' cause apparently i st@@ ole food from the shed and then burned it down .
someone fr@@ amed me .
they wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
i don 't know who did it .
you know , frank@@ ly , i don 't really care anymore , you know ?
i don 't really need them any@@ ways .
you know , obviously , i can take care of myself .
took them how long to build a fire ?
i did it in five minutes in the dark .
( daniel ) i can 't believe
johnny 's gon@@ na just stay out in the woods .
that 's crazy .
and why shouldn 't he ?
after all the crap that he 's pulled ?
he 'll be fine .
and if he 's not , you got a better chance of win@@ ning .
and you can keep his bed .
i want to make it to the end , but i want to do it as a team , kind of like how ne@@ eko 's doing it , you know ?
can i tell you something ?
( daniel ) sure .
you 're a smart guy .
you know that ne@@ eko is a professional athle@@ te ?
he pl@@ ays game for living .
how about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trust@@ s him , just to win the game ?
have you ever thought about it ?
i don 't think you should trust him .
( sam ) can 't trust any@@ body .
guys ?
i get up early , and as soon as i open the door , i practically ran into this spe@@ ar that 's stuck in the ground .
it felt like a threat .
let me see .
( woman ) what does it say ?
it says ... ( spe@@ aks rus@@ sian )
( woman ) what is that ?
it means " get out . "
it 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
it 's a nice pro@@ p .
look at it .
it 's not real .
nice scar@@ e t@@ acti@@ c .
they 're watching .
i 'm sure they 're loving this .
( woman ) why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
who wants you guys to get out ?
( man ) well , this is here on purpose .
that 's for sure .
it 's here on purpose .
it 's here for a reason .
you guys gon@@ na be so gul@@ li@@ ble to fall for this , really ?
( daniel ) who else could 've left that spe@@ ar ?
besides production , who could 've done it ?
we 're the only people out here .
aren 't we ?
♪
- are you okay ?
- i 'm fine .
i mean , aren 't you still scared ?
the spe@@ ar this morning telling us to leave ?
that doesn 't scar@@ e you at all ?
i think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
i miss home .
i miss my family .
i even miss my stupid ex-@@ boyfriend .
this place is@@ -- it 's getting to me .
i don 't know .
i 'm thinking about pushing the button .
i don 't want you to go .
you know what i mean ?
i thin@@ k@@ -- i think we can win this .
we just need to@@ --
but i don 't need to stay .
i don 't understand why i 'm even staying .
i don 't need the money that badly .
i do .
annie .
( sam ) i 've been a l@@ one wolf for a while , you know ?
i 've been on my own for a while .
i 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than i have been in a long time because i 'm inter@@ acting with people more often than i have in many years .
now i consider daniel a friend .
he 's a good kid .
if i had a son , i 'd be proud if he was like daniel .
what are you looking at ?
- just watching those two .
- m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
( daniel ) i don 't want to over@@ step my bo@@ unds , you know .
i don 't know how she feels about me , and so i 'm just kind of@@ --
i 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard ' cause i really want to , you know , see where this is gon@@ na go .
i don 't know .
at the same time , i don 't want to get hurt .
don 't worry .
she knows you ex@@ ist .
how would i really get her to ?
i don 't know , like ...
get her to what ?
like me like me .
you can 't get her to like you .
either she does or she doesn 't .
you know ?
( laugh@@ s )
how beautiful is it ?
this is so nice .
_
why not ?
_
( laugh@@ s )
i 'm sorry .
i 'm being nau@@ gh@@ ty .
it 's beautiful in , though .

you must be hot .
come on .

- no good ... _
- no one 's here .
- it 's trouble .
no one 's here .
i 'm not gon@@ na tell anyone .

- oh , yeah ?

you 'll thank me once you 're in here .
it 's beautiful .

i 'm gon@@ na film us .

( laugh@@ s ) it 's a great idea .
( laugh@@ s )
you promise you 'll er@@ ase it ?
_
- promise me ?
- i promise .
good .
annie ?
wait , annie .
you shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
it 's not safe .

what are you talking about ?
come on , it 's not safe .
stop . wait .
don 't be like this .
be like what ?
look , i-@@ - ( sig@@ hs )
it 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
i 'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-@@ boyfriend , and i get that you 're sad about that .
but you 're for@@ getting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
no , i 'm not .
( annie ) i like her .
it 's been a while since i 've been with any@@ body , but i-@@ -
we get along so well .
i just feel like a dum@@ bass now .
i mean , she 's probably not gon@@ na talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- hey .
- ( irene ) hey .
- there you are .
- ( irene ) how 's it going ?
good .
i just wanted to talk to you .
u@@ h-@@ huh ?
um , so , victoria 's gone .
um , i 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
oh , it '@@ s-@@ - well , it 's free right now .
so no one would mind if i moved in ?
um ... yeah , yeah .
i mean , i don 't mind .
i don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
( est@@ her ) aw@@ esome .
all right , i 'll go grab my things .
it 's not that i didn 't have fun with the boys .
i don 't know .
i just feel like my time there is done .
it 's served its purpose , and i want to@@ --
i want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- ( mil@@ jan ) hey .
- hey .
- ( mil@@ jan ) what are you doing ?
- i 'm leaving .
you mean the show ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s ) no , you idiot .
i 'm gon@@ na move into victoria 's old bed .
wait .
why ?
why ?
because it 's free .
( mil@@ jan ) i know , but i thought you liked it here with me .
you said we are great ro@@ om@@ mates .
yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
just , i don 't know .
i want to be with the girls now .
come on , est@@ her .
don 't you think we should team up ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s )
we are both smar@@ ter than everyone else here .
we can win this th@@ ing@@ -- together .
oh@@ h , i like your style .
i will think about it .
but hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
i was just thinking that we could have something ... ( est@@ her ) you thought what ?
that we could get rom@@ antic a little bit ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s )
( mil@@ jan ) don 't laugh .
really ?
i don 't do romance .
look , we 're playing a game .
( mil@@ jan ) what do you mean ?
( est@@ her ) i 'm playing a gam@@ e-@@ - for money .
i don 't do romance , and i 'm not playing a dating game .
i 'm sorry .
fuck you , bitch !
fuck you , bitch !
you 're not going anywhere .
get the fuck off me !
( mil@@ jan ) i 'm kid@@ ding .
( laughing ) i was just kid@@ ding , est@@ her .
i 'm just kid@@ ding .
est@@ her .
( est@@ her ) don 't you fucking touch me again .
( mil@@ jan ) come on ! i 'm just@@ -
- i was just kid@@ ding !
( est@@ her ) i think i was in shock .
i-@@ i don 't know .
it happened so quickly .
but he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bun@@ k , and then he backed off .
( mil@@ jan ) est@@ her is a player .
we all know that .
and i played with her , too .
so she was on the way out .
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jo@@ king@@ ly , like preten@@ ding that i 'm like scar@@ ing her .
" you 're gon@@ na stay here , " or something .
she just , like , fre@@ aked out .
she pushed me away .
she 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
stor@@ med out , like mad .
and i was just telling her , " i 'm jo@@ king .
you know me . i always joke around .
i was just jo@@ king with you . "
i didn 't get it , seriously .
she just fre@@ aked out , and it was just a pure joke .
what are you showing me ?
it was right here .
( carolina ) are you sure ?
( ne@@ eko ) big huge car@@ cas@@ s .
gut@@ s hanging out and everything .
look .
look at what ?
the blood ?
it could 've been anything .
it could 've been a bird . it could 've been a de@@ er .
( ne@@ eko ) why would i make this up ?
why would i lie ?
there was a hu@@ ge@@ -- there was a huge tiger there .
i guess they took it .
the produ@@ cer@@ s took it .
the produ@@ cer@@ s ?
i think she thinks that i could 've been trying to scar@@ e her , play a sick joke on her .
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person .
for all i know , johnny took it .
( carolina ) johnny took it ?
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
i don 't know .
( carolina ) oh , now johnny does everything ?
not only do we have to worry about the produ@@ cer@@ s playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
hope@@ fully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here .
i don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
why are you always defen@@ ding him ?
why are you always defen@@ ding him ?
i 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
you need to watch yourself !
i 'm kind of b@@ aff@@ led where it 's gone , you know , ' cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
it would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hef@@ ty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
it 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
got some trap@@ s set up along this way somewhere .
i found some de@@ er tra@@ ils i s@@ cou@@ ted earlier .
hope they catch something .
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty aw@@ esome , actually .
had a nice little fire .
weather was nice .
you know , wrapped up .
it was nice being on my own .
it 's what i wanted to do origin@@ ally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and i got that , so pretty content .
what the hell did this , man ?
this thing 's ...
i mean , it , obviously , it ripped the de@@ er while it was standing here .
it was strong enough to rip it off@@ -- rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
( crack )
what do you want ?
what are you doing ?
( johnny ) i 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
what do you want ?
i just came to try to convince you to come back .
( johnny ) try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
yeah , i don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
i think it 's saf@@ er here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accus@@ ations .
just , whatever happened , i don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here .
well , you know what ?
i really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
i 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
i can take care of myself .
y '@@ all try taking care of your@@ selves , too , all right ?
( carolina ) okay , fine .
if that 's how you want to be , then fine .
( johnny ) fine .
nah , that '@@ s-@@ - that 's not good enough .
that ain 't good enough .
( daniel ) hey , irene .
hey , dan .
what@@ cha doing ?
collec@@ ting some acor@@ ns .
- oh .
- yeah .
if you mas@@ h them up , you can make like a pa@@ ste and make a pan@@ cake out of it .
- really ?
- yeah .
is it@@ -- does it taste good ?
i think so .
you want me to help ?
oh , sure .
that 'd be great . yeah .
they 're kind of scat@@ tered all over .
daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gent@@ le-@@ - a very gentle spirit ,
i guess you can say .
hey .
it 's a si@@ ber@@ ian squ@@ ill .
( irene ) i 'm not really big on flowers .
why not ?
well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower ' cause it 's like , " oh , you know , i like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
it never really made sense to me .
( chuck@@ les )
something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
( daniel ) she 's got so much comple@@ x@@ ity to her , you know ?
i find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that i would 've never expected out of her .
it 's ... ( chuck@@ les )
she 's just@@ -- she 's amazing .
( both chuck@@ le )
where are we ?
i can 't find the path .
we 're lost .
- we 're not lost .
- no , we 're lost .
i don 't know where we 're going .
( mil@@ jan ) in the middle of the wood , very close to the river ,
i found this really we@@ ir@@ d-@@ looking tree .
i mean , it wasn 't a tree .
it was something different .
it had a face shape .
it had hair .
what ?
my name is mil@@ jan .
it 's really nice to meet you . ( chuck@@ les )
what is your name ?
og@@ dee ?
( laugh@@ s )
this is my friend og@@ dee .
we go way back , man .
( laugh@@ s )
he 's so bad .
i spoke to it .
we had a little conversation .
og@@ dee is my old friend from high school .
( laugh@@ s )
i 'm kid@@ ding .
- ( man ) est@@ her .
est@@ her .
- what ?
( est@@ her ) hey .
where have you been ?
out .
out ?
where do you go all day , anyway ?
( whisper@@ ing ) okay .
i can 't believe you got us so lost .
we 're not lost .
yes , we are .
where are we ?
do you know where we are ?
we 're in siberia .
not funny .
oh , god !
what is that ?
did you hear that ?
i heard it .
come on .
there might be something out here .
come on .
oh !
oh , god !
what are you doing out here ?
sorry .
i 'm going to get water .
where are you going ?
hom@@ e-@@ - where the hell is it ?
that way .
why is she being such a bitch ?
why are you here , by the way , alone ?
no reason .
u@@ h-@@ huh .
that 's susp@@ icious .
( annie ) shut up , mil@@ jan .
( chuck@@ les )
( ne@@ eko ) guys , have you seen carolina ?
( sam ) no .
she hasn 't come back .
you mean she 's not back yet ?
she 's not back .
i have no idea where she is .
i haven 't seen her .
you do know she 's out there with johnny ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i know .
well , i don 't know about you , but i feel like i should go and look for her .
i don '@@ t-@@ - i don 't feel comfortable with her with johnny .
( sam ) before it gets too late , i think we should .
i 'm game , yeah .
( ne@@ eko ) - you 're gon@@ na come with me ?
- yeah .
( mil@@ jan ) gentlem@@ en .
where the hell were you ?
i was in the woods .
have you seen carolina ?
( ne@@ eko ) she 's out there with johnny .
( mil@@ jan ) oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- come on .
- are you serious ?
( mil@@ jan ) yes .
they 're probably having sex or something .
oh , you 're a funny guy .
don 't be nai@@ ve . you didn 't notice the chem@@ ist@@ ry they had ?
( ne@@ eko ) hey , guys , listen .
i 'm gon@@ na look for her .
i don 't know about you .
just sitting here talking .
( mil@@ jan ) hey , it 's dark outside .
( rum@@ bling )
oh , fuck !
( ne@@ eko ) get on the bed .
get onto the bed !
the bed ?
( mil@@ jan ) oh , my god .
what is this ?
the cab started shaking ...
ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that i 've never seen in my life , and i 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
what is it ?
it 's lik@@ e-@@ - it 's like the sky 's on fire .
what ?
it 's like the sky 's on fire .
( daniel ) the sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like victoria said .
if this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
i don 't understand how they could pull it off .
( sam ) i feel like i 'm on another planet .
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and no@@ body@@ -- nobody has any answers .
i don 't have an answer .
i could sit here all day long and just@@ -- it 's way above my pay scale .
- is it moving ?
- it just ke@@ eps moving .
carolina never came back today , did she ?
( woman ) yeah .
wh@@ ere@@ -- where are they ?
( mil@@ jan ) she 's still in the wood@@ s-@@ - the forest .
well , this can 't stop us .
we still have to find her .
we can 't leave her out there .
we better go now .
we 're just gon@@ na go look for her@@ -- me and sam , daniel , mil@@ jan as well .
oh , my god .
carolina ?
carolina .
are you okay ?
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting )
( woman ) what happened ?
oh , my god .
carolina !
- what happened ?
are you okay ?
- are you okay ?
then we see carolina stum@@ bling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rus@@ hing over to her .
are you hurt somewhere ?
- ( sam ) what happened ?
- ( woman ) look at all the blood .
what happened ?
she 's ble@@ eding .
guys , don 't , don '@@ t-@@ - don 't go to her .
oh , my god , look at her arm .
look at her arm .
( sam ) what happened to you ?
you 're okay .
( ne@@ eko ) carolina , what happened ?
( daniel ) carolina shows up , and she 's bat@@ tered and dis@@ orient@@ ed .
she couldn 't even speak .
she 's trembling .
( carolina ) i don 't ...
she doesn 't remember .
- ( woman ) you don 't remember ? - ( carolina cri@@ es )
( sam ) what do you remember ?
( natalie ) she didn 't know what was going on .
she was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
she was just talking non@@ sense , and it was really jol@@ ting to see her come back like that .
_
( woman ) you were with john ?
- ( sam ) and what happened ?
- ( woman ) where is he ?
what were you doing with johnny ?
get her some water .
get her some help .
( ne@@ eko ) carolina , were you with johnny ?
( sam ) she said she was .
what were you doing with johnny ?
( ne@@ eko ) she said the name " johnny . "
at that point , i just , you know , lost it .
listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
( ne@@ eko ) for what ?
here , just come here .
come here .
i want to say something to you .
- what ?
- listen to me !
it 's important .
you got to make sure .
you look at his hands .
( ne@@ eko ) okay .
his hands are a t@@ ell@@ -@@ tale sign , okay ?
his hands will tell you if he did something .
( daniel ) what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
stay here with the girls .
stay here with the girls !
( ne@@ eko ) i 'm not wast@@ ing any more time with this guy .
everyone wants to keep him around , thinking ,
" oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
no , i don 't think so .
i 'm not gon@@ na lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- she 's been through a lot .
- yeah .
we 're gon@@ na look after you , okay ?
don 't worry .
( est@@ her ) we don 't know where johnny is .
carolina sort of@@ -- she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was@@ -- they were fig@@ ht@@ ing@@ -- her and johnny were fighting .
and then , now she looks like this , so johnny should be probably fe@@ aring for his life right now because sam and ne@@ eko went after him .
let 's just keep moving .
( rust@@ ling )
move .
move .
_
( rust@@ ling contin@@ ues )
the whole walking through the woods and hearing no@@ ises coming from places that , you know@@ --
we stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
it 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
i haven 't slept very well , you know .
so i 'm just@@ -- you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
you always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
i don 't know .
( animal scre@@ ech@@ es )
well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
( rust@@ ling )
yes .
you keep saying " he , " " he . "
look how thick the brush is here .
if there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
we hear other things .
all of a sudden , something goes flying .
i think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
i 'll go see if the water 's bo@@ iled .
thank you .
( natalie ) i don 't want to die .
i didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibil@@ ity on this show , and every day that i 'm here ,
i feel like i 'm an idiot for staying , that i am gon@@ na end up like tommy .
( cri@@ es )
i don 't deal well with@@ -- ab@@ use is not something that ...
i can handle right now .
i 'm scared .
( daniel ) and johnny was already on the ou@@ ts with the group for ste@@ aling food .
i just@@ -- how could he do that to her ?
it didn 't make sense .
she 's such a nice lady .
( foot@@ steps )
johnny .
hey .
what did you do ?
- huh ?
- what did you do to carolina ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
what do you mean you don 't know what i 'm talking about ?
- what 'd you do to her ?
- i didn '@@ t-@@ -
she 's all cut up and shit .
i don '@@ t-
- i don 't know .
i ...
what 's wrong with you ?
i don 't know . i just@@ -
- i kind of came to .
i was walking around , and ...
i don 't know .
i was@@ - - i saw her .
you saw her where ?
you got to tell me what happened .
we were in the woods , and ...
i don 't real@@ ly@@ -- i don 't really remember .
i get approached by daniel , and bas@@ ically started accus@@ ing me of hur@@ ting carolina .
i didn 't know what to say .
( natalie ) what did you to do her ? !
the last thing she remem@@ bers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
i don 't .
( natalie ) then what happened to her ?
i don 't know .
that 's not a very good answer right now , man .
i don '@@ t-@@ - trust me .
that 's not a very good answer .
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting in distance )
hey .
you hear that ?
at the camp .
let 's go .
i don 't know .
are you serious ?
you don 't know ?
you 're such a s@@ cum@@ bag .
oh , what ?
so she just fell down and ended up that way ?
are you kid@@ ding me ?
i was in a complete ha@@ ze .
i had no re@@ collection .
i was like black@@ ed out , like i dr@@ ank too much .
( daniel ) he doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on .
( johnny ) i don 't .
- then what happened to her ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
i don 't know .
( woman ) you were together , weren 't you ?
- you said that .
- shit !
ne@@ eko !
ne@@ eko !
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting )
( daniel ) guys , he doesn 't know !
( ne@@ eko )
- mother@@ fu@@ cker !
( daniel )
- come on !
stop it !
- ( carolina ) stop !
stop it !
- ( ne@@ eko ) come on !
stop it !
ne@@ eko , stop it !
he didn 't do it !
carolina starts screaming , " it 's not him .
he didn 't do it . "
stop it !
what do you mean ?
you said you don 't remember .
you said you don 't remember .
( ne@@ eko ) you 're a dead man .
you 're a fucking dead man .
( daniel ) listen .
listen .
hey , hey .
hey !
calm down .
listen .
- what happened ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
talk to me .
i don 't know .
johnny doesn 't know anything ?
he doesn 't remember anything .
it was just her and him in the forest .
i know that .
i know that .
i saw it in his eyes , okay ?
all i remember is i talked to her .
we were argu@@ ing .
and then i-@@ i came here , and i started getting acc@@ used , and i don 't even know what the fuck is going on .
( sam ) if we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
when i saw that look in his eyes ,
i just felt that i needed to take a step back .
remember the way she came into camp ?
he 's got the same look on his face .
( johnny ) does she remember anything ?
( woman ) show us your hands .
( woman ) ( gas@@ ps )
( natalie ) oh , yeah .
i 've seen that before .
( woman ) what 's that from ?
( sam ) nothing 's making sense here .
and just to be angry and become a bunch of anim@@ al@@ s-@@ -
we can 't go killing each other .
we 're still human be@@ ings .
( his@@ s )
( talking indi@@ st@@ inc@@ tly )
( birds chir@@ ping )
i don 't like things that i can 't explain and that i don 't have at least some sort of control over .
the sky changing color and looking like fi@@ re-@@ - the produ@@ cer@@ s , the show can 't do that .
we 're talking super@@ natural stuff now .
reg@@ ard@@ less of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
( johnny ) it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her .
i 've never hit a woman in my life .
i don 't know why i would .
i don 't remember anything , but ...
i can 't say that i didn 't ' cause i don '@@ t-@@ -
i don 't know what happened .
but i know in my heart i wouldn 't do that .
( carolina ) i don 't remember anything .
all i remember is that i was ... with@@ --
went to get johnny .
he was in the woods .
i found him , and i ...
it 's all one big bl@@ ur , like one big black@@ out .
i have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and i don 't remember .
i don 't understand .
so you 're telling me this is real .
( sab@@ ina ) yes .
it looks like it 's nat@@ ive , hand@@ made .
it looks like it 's just a pro@@ p to me .
well , if it 's a pro@@ p , it 's really well-@@ made ' cause you see the bar@@ bs .
they 're cur@@ ved .
that 's exactly how it should look .
this is o@@ x .
it 's real o@@ x .
and it 's balan@@ ced for throwing .
it just looks perfect .
it 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
i don 't have to deal with lies in figur@@ ing out what is true , what is not .
i have to know the environ@@ ment i 'm in .
i have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
look at this .
so , i found this symbol that is really strange .
it has four lines and little triang@@ les on the ends .
then i found another one and another one , and i realized it 's a path .
i should follow them .
at the end , it was very close to the sett@@ lement .
i found the last one .
and i found this box .
it was a metal box .
i opened it , and it was a book .
i didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
i would assume it 's rus@@ sian because it 's cyril@@ li@@ c letters .
( mil@@ jan ) in the middle of me looking at it , somebody was watching at me .
it was a person .
he 's staring at me .
and he just disappeared in a second .
so there are people out there .
hey .
i was just gon@@ na try and make things better , and , like , apologi@@ ze , and just wanted to let her know that i didn 't , you know ,
i didn 't want to scre@@ w anything up or make anything awkward for her .
i guess i was in a weird mood , and i just want to apologi@@ ze because i don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because i 'm really glad you '@@ re-@@ -
( natalie ) when i realized what annie 's real feelings were for me ,
i just thought ...
" i 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
so i kissed her .
( chuck@@ les )
which i kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
( laugh@@ s )
don 't worry about it .
hey .
hey .
can i have a seat ?
how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
you ?
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing ' cause i knew she had scrat@@ ches and stuff on her , and she was sure fre@@ aked out like i was .
( carolina ) do you remember anything from last night ?
no .
i don 't remember a thing .
i don 't remember anything either .
but i know you didn 't hurt me .
i would never hurt you .

( johnny ) can i ask you something , though ?
why 'd you set me up ?
with the shed and the food ?
she couldn 't even look me in the eye .
and i was like , " well ... "
i was like , " it tells me all i need to know , "
so i was lik@@ e-@@ - got the hell out of there .
johnny .
johnny .
( span@@ ish ) stop , please .
johnny , wait for me .
- give me a break . ( span@@ ish ) oh , my god . - ( daniel ) hey .

and then it just@@ -- the light bul@@ b went off .
yeah , that 's like your slo@@ gan .
she 's that act@@ ress from that show that@@ --
i 'm like , " that 's how i know you . "
i didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't want@@ -

i didn 't want to burn it down .
i didn 't want to set you up .
they told me to .
who 's they ?

i have my health card .
i even pin@@ ched some money from jean and elo@@ die ... for the train .

i saw that in a movie .
i 'll feed you .
in america , samuel will help me cross the bor@@ der .
now that you 're an or@@ phan , my parents could adop@@ t you .

they were aw@@ fully worried .
isaac !
olivier !

is elo@@ die with you ?
no . she doesn 't know i 'm coming with you .

but these children are ut@@ ter@@ ly out of their min@@ ds !
olivier , we would glad@@ ly take you if we could , but we 're not your parents .
we can adop@@ t him !
david , look .
we can 't just adop@@ t someone .
and then , olivier has a family , an aunt who has the means to give him a good education .
i don 't want to go to aunt victoria 's .
she 's a co@@ w ! listen .
once we get to hav@@ re , i 'll call elo@@ die .
i 'll buy a tic@@ ket for your return , and she 'll come ... pick you up at the saint-@@ laz@@ are station .

i will explain ... and she 'll understand .
if he can 't come with us , then i 'm staying with him .
isaac , tell them it 's not possible !
listen , olivier ...
we understand your sor@@ row but please , be reason@@ able .
no . it 's not true .
you understand nothing !

olivier , wait for me !
i 'm coming with you !
david , come back !
hurry david , hurry up !
children , come back !
ou@@ ch !

- come here , david .
- i 'll see what i can do .
i don 't want to go with you .
david !
come back , kid .

thank you .
but first ... i must tell you what happened .
don 't worry .
i know all about it .
everything 's been sor@@ ted out .
i 've already been to the police station and have spoken to elo@@ die .
she 's waiting for you .
- she 's glad you 're in good health .
- she won 't send me to reform school ?
nothing of the sort .
everyone knows what you 're going through right now .
elo@@ die even has a surprise for you .
come on , eat up .
then we 'll go see her .
okay , sir .
this is so good !
i 'm coming !
olivier , i 'm so glad to see you .
you 're okay ?
- you 're not too tired ?
- no , no .
i 'm fine .
i 'm fine .
elo@@ die ... i wanted to apologi@@ ze .
for the money and for the scar@@ e i 've given you .
you know , we all make mist@@ akes .
it wasn 't too serious .
and we understand you .
without your mom , and also with david 's depar@@ ture ...
this is why mister pri@@ vat and we decided to make you a big surprise .
what is it ?
you 'll go with him to sau@@ gues .
you 'll see , there you 'll be very , very happy .
you 'll have a big bedroom all to yourself .
you 'll learn to ride a horse .
and then the mountain air , there 's nothing better for a child !
and i don 't live far from your grand@@ parents .
you can see them when you want .
and there 's also a very good school .
your studies will be better there .
what does aunt victoria say ?
she wouldn 't let me see you !
who does she think she is ?
it 's none of her business .
well , don 't stand there .
sit down , mr. pri@@ vat .
after all , it was your mother 's idea , to go with mr. pri@@ vat .
if you want to , of course .
when 's that gon@@ na be ?
well , today .
you see , i finished pack@@ ing your suit@@ case .
so you can catch the 2 pm train .
you 'll see , you 'll be better off there than here .
- why so fast ?
- aunt victoria could make trouble .
trouble ?
yes . by law i don 't have the right to take you .
i 'll have a law@@ yer if necessary .
i 'll say that it was your mother 's wish and yours as well .
don 't you worry olivier .
you 'd only get miser@@ able here .
there are too many memories .
i wonder if i have time to say goodbye to m@@ ado .
you and your m@@ ado , i tell you !
better hurry , you don 't want to miss the 2 pm train .
get on with it .
olivier !
i 'm so happy to see you .
you gave us such a scar@@ e !
when did you get back ?
this morning .
- well , come in !
- no , no .
i came to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
yes .
i 'm going to auverg@@ ne with a friend of my mother 's .
it may be the best for you .
olivier !
- hurry up !
- yes .
i 'm coming !
i 'll have to go .
by the way ...
i just wanted to tell you that ...
i 'll never forget you .
goodbye , olivier .
- don 't forget to write me !
- yes , m@@ ado .
hey , artiller@@ y@@ man !
hit@@ ting the road without saying goodbye ?
yeah . i 'm going to auverg@@ ne .
give my reg@@ ards to the volcan@@ o@@ es !
- okay .
- right , shall we go ?
where you 're going with that suit@@ case ?
well , i 'm leaving .
- for long ?
- i don 't know .
maybe for good .
don 't forget me too fast , okay ?
come on , oliver .
come .
olivier !
olivier .
i made you some pan@@ cak@@ es .
i know you like them so much .
you can eat them on the train .
you were always so sweet .
don 't change too much over there .
okay , i 'll leave you here because ... far@@ e@@ wells makes me too sad .
olivier , it 's for your own good , you know that don 't you ?
come on , give me a kiss .
now don 't you worry .
i 'll see you soon .
- thank you , mr. pri@@ vat .
- goodbye . let 's go .
i say , you 're a real celebr@@ ity around here .
have you ever been to sau@@ gues , before the funeral ?
no , sir . never .
call me andre .
gare d '@@ or@@ say .
get in .
no . i can 't .
i can 't .
what 's the matter ?
i can 't leave my street .
it 's not because of you , but i want to stay here .
- why did you call me , then ?
i thought ... - i know .
it 's my fault .
but i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave bou@@ gr@@ as , m@@ ado ,
cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re , lo@@ ul@@ ou ...
i don 't even want to leave i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee .
don 't worry , olivier .
i understand completely .
we will do what you want .
anyway , think about it .
if you need me , write me .
well , goodbye .
olivier !
what 's going on ?
where is mr. pri@@ vat ?
well , he took a taxi .
how so ?
without you ?
i didn 't want to leave .
what ? are you crazy ?
everything was arrang@@ ed !
i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave my friends .
and you , of course .
you think you 're gon@@ na stay with us ?
we can 't af@@ ford it , you know that !
if that 's the way it 's going to be , i 'll in@@ form aunt victoria .
and the family council will have to decide .
henri , i 'm coun@@ ting on you .
you will be firm .
as usual , my dear .
wow , check out this tin can !
can you believe this ?
it 's sl@@ ick .
- really sn@@ az@@ zy !
- hey , get away from there !
here we are !
- hello , henri .
- hello , jean .
ah , here 's our little advent@@ urer .
- hello , elo@@ die .
- hello .
you 'll be able to br@@ ag about the awful fri@@ ght you gave us .
oh yes !
you can say that again !
- hello .
- hello .
as you know , the haber@@ das@@ her@@ y has been sol@@ d .
i gathered for you some of your mother 's things , olivier .
there are some personal it@@ ems , sou@@ ven@@ irs , photos of your father , - and several school no@@ te@@ books .
- thanks , aunt .
it 's only natural , olivier .
your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will rece@@ ive .
say uncle , what is a guardian ?
it means i am responsible for you .
- as if you were my father ?
- yes , something like that .
come one , sort these out in your room .
what 's a family council ?
well , the family ga@@ thers to de@@ termine what is best for your future .
why can 't i listen to what 's being said ?
because that 's the way it is .
go , please leave us .
take it .
go .
please , let 's sit down and talk .
what do you plan on doing with him ?
us , what do you mean ?
it 's up to you to take him . you 're his aunt .
i 'm only his cousin , and a distant one at that .
come on . i 'm sure we can find a solution together .
one obviously comes to mind .
yes . the or@@ phan@@ age .
that might be a little har@@ sh .
we had something else in mind .
if we wanted to honor virgin@@ ie 's w@@ ishes , it would be up to m. pri@@ vat to take care of him .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again :
- it is out of the question .
he 's an ex-@@ convic@@ t , remember that .
what would the people say in sau@@ gues ?
what would they think of us ?
besides , the kid doesn 't want that .
how would you know ?
i suppose i can tell you , now .
on the day he returned from his fu@@ gue , he called pri@@ vat at his estate .
i thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him .
unfortunately , at the last minute , he decided he wanted to stay with us .
if i understand correc@@ tly , you decided this without our knowing .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
it would have su@@ ited everyone .
i 'm not of that opinion .
but , since you de@@ em@@ ed it un@@ necessary to consul@@ t me , it 's because you don 't recognize my right .
it 's up to you to take care of him .
besides , his world is here .
in our milieu , he would be all confused .
that 's it , victoria .
you 're too good for your brother 's son .
i didn 't say that .
no need to be so offensive .
un@@ question@@ ably , you can 't den@@ y ... that olivier has spent all of his life on this street .
his school and his friends are here .
besides , at this moment , with my son coming down with tubercul@@ osis , have you thought of the risk of con@@ tag@@ ion ?
yes , of course i have .
how are we going to feed him ?
- we 're already strugg@@ ling .
- and this apartment is too small .
i could help you .
tempor@@ arily , of course .
well in that case , maybe we could keep him .
we would need ...
i don 't know ... 150 francs a month .
- what ? half of that would be plenty .
that just wouldn 't be enough .
but we will make an effort until the end of the school year .
after that , we won 't be able to .
you do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon .
elo@@ die , you 've been chant@@ ing that for the last 2 years .
how can you say that , victoria !
- i didn 't mean to off@@ end you .
- that 's too easy ! jean , tell her to get out of here !
now , now , preci@@ ous , victoria has apologi@@ z@@ ed .
impl@@ ying that we 're only good at making bab@@ es with tubercul@@ osis , that takes the cake !
i will not stay here one second longer .
- let 's go , henri .
- no . wait for me in the car .
what a mess !
especially since we agreed to a sett@@ lement .
henri , i would think that with 115 ... okay , let 's say 110 , we could make ends meet . come now , let 's not nego@@ ti@@ ate again .
our proposition stands at 100 .
if that doesn 't work out , we can always discus@@ s it further .
- so let 's start with 100 .
- here is the first month 's .
- goodbye , henri .
- yes , goodbye .
elo@@ die .
elo@@ die , open the door , please .
ah , you !
you could have taken my side at least !
they were ready to give us 100 francs . i wasn 't going to mess with that .
lucky for us , i pat@@ ched things up !
you call that pat@@ ching things up ?
you know it won 't be enough .
i told you , we need at least 130 franc .
if i work for the rest , maybe i can stay ?
you know the answer is yes .
you 're e@@ aves@@ dropping .
but not for long . but why ?
because you 're a pain , that 's why .
all you care about is whether you can stay or not !
look at you .
you 're y@@ elling at the kid , yet in front of victoria , you can 't grow a pair !
you ... looks like you 're cour@@ ting back luck .
i got it , i got it !
" dear david ,
" it 's been 6 weeks to this day since your depar@@ ture .
" i have no news from you , which means you 're probably busy ,
" as well as your parents . "
hey , olivier , you coming ?
we 've made our own wad@@ ing pool .
now , let me give you some ad@@ vice .
come play with us instead of wast@@ ing ink ...
- on a guy who 'll never answer you .
- would you leave me alone , lo@@ ul@@ ou ?
come on , lo@@ ul@@ ou !
i 'm coming !
g@@ laz@@ ier !
g@@ laz@@ ier !
so , artiller@@ y@@ man , you still here ?
why the sad face ?
david is gone .
i have no news of him .
i can 't stay with my cous@@ ins .
i would have to some@@ what ear@@ n my keep .
you could always help me with my cho@@ res , right ?
you 'll see , ear@@ ning your keep isn 't that hard .
and if you ask me , you shouldn 't waste your time like this , staring for hours at your mother 's old bou@@ tique .
that won 't bring her back , you know .
i know it 's not fair .
and with your best friend gone .
you feel abandon@@ ed .
but friends ... you still have quite a few around here .
and you 'll make new ones .
see , look at your bud@@ dies .
you have to open up , olivier .
you understand ?
come on , ol@@ ive !
no bad feelings !
go on , go !
come on , we 're having a sp@@ lash !
hurry up , for god 's sake !
aren 't you done yet wast@@ ing this water ... with your stupid games ?
- bunch of gut@@ ter-@@ pu@@ pp@@ ies !
- we 're doing nothing wrong .
" nothing wrong " ?
what if there 's a fire , where would the water come from ?
come on , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et , have you never been young ? children should have fun .
what right have you , madame ?
i have no les@@ sons to learn from a .... from a hook@@ er .
are you afraid you might get hook@@ ed , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et ?
i think i could te@@ ach you a few things .
let 's stop there .
i have nothing to say to you .
you started it , old far@@ t .
she really na@@ iled you , gast@@ oun@@ et !
you anarch@@ ist , i have nothing to say to you .
and you ? who do you think you are , you old grin@@ ch .
we 're not about to stop the children from having fun !
taking the moral high ground instead of swe@@ eping his own porch .
what a sour@@ pus@@ s !
- how 's the work coming downstairs ?
- very well , very well .
- bou@@ gr@@ as says we 'll be done by 5 .
- good .
that 's very good .
here you go , two che@@ ese sand@@ wich@@ es .
enjoy . thank you very much .
ah ... there 's i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee .
thanks .
good day , sir , you okay ?
no , i 'm not okay .
the salv@@ ation army and sou@@ p kitchen close in the spring .
i 'm hungry . artiller@@ y@@ man !
where are my sand@@ wich@@ es ?
coming , coming !
good lord , a nice shot of red and a che@@ ese sand@@ wich .
the only 2 things worth living for !
hey , hey ... easy there little f@@ eller .
i offer for the taste , not to gu@@ zz@@ le .
if you 're thir@@ st@@ y , drink water .
would you like a fa@@ g , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as ?
ernest gave them to me .
oh no . bou@@ gr@@ as , he always st@@ icks to the p@@ ipe .
say , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as ...
why do you have a be@@ ard ?
it 's to hide the ugly mug underneath !
now then , back to work !
look here , i think you 're filling them up too much .
you trying to get me slo@@ shed ?
- see you , ernest .
- see you !
well , my cell@@ ar rats ?
mission accompl@@ ished , boss !
but there are 3 bott@@ les that are a bit clo@@ ud@@ y .
that 's normal , it 's the bottom of the bar@@ rel .
you can have them .
not a bad lot , but i can 't sell them .
- good . now , we agreed on 25 franc ?
- yes , that 's it .
- here , then .
- thanks .
here , this is for you .
ten francs ?
but it 's too much , mr@@ .@@ bou@@ gr@@ as .
didn 't you say you needed extra dou@@ gh to help your cousin ?
and to top it off , here 's an eg@@ g@@ plant for sup@@ per@@ time .
here .
- but why ?
- it 's not for your work ,
i o@@ wed your mother money , but i forgot .
you can check the led@@ gers , it 's all in writing .
in that case , thanks !
that should help with your keep .
your cousin will probably want you to stay , now .
- what can i get you ?
- anything you want , except red .
nothing for me , i have er@@ rand@@ s .
- so long , ernest .
so long , bou@@ gr@@ as .
- so long , kid ! - how about white wine ?
- can 't say no to that .
that must be him !
you know how late you are ?
where were you ?
- we started without you .
- forgive me , elo@@ die .
- good lord , you 're re@@ ek@@ ing of wine !
- and what 's this ?
a leg of ve@@ al !
leg of ve@@ al ?
- you didn 't ste@@ al it i hope ?
- no . no . i 've been working with bou@@ gr@@ as at the tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tique .
in that case , that 's really nice of you .
i even brought you some wine , jean .
beau@@ jol@@ p@@ if ?
let 's have a sw@@ ig !
- would you like a bit ?
- sure i would .
- so , how is it ?
- not bad , not bad .
excellent , yeah !
see ? he 's not a bad kid , after all .
we would keep you if we were rich , you know .
no wor@@ ries . i could stop going to school .
i could s@@ cro@@ unge a bit more with bou@@ gr@@ as .
i would ear@@ n more money and help you out .
don 't be stupid , olivier !
you think your mom would appro@@ ve of you turning into a street ur@@ chin ?
you don 't want to go to school , anymore ?
end up as a dro@@ p-@@ out like bou@@ gr@@ as ?
if i could have stayed longer in school , we wouldn 't be here today .
he 's right . you 're lucky to have your aunt victoria .
- we 're too young .
- and you don 't want me around .
that 's not true .
don 't say that ..
but taking care of you is a sacrif@@ ice .
if he had to work , people would say we 're exploit@@ ing him .
his aunt should take him in .
no ! you also said she 's a co@@ w .
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , you 'll still go to school .
alright , jean .
may i have some more ?
you certainly have an ap@@ petite this evening .
i 'm flat@@ tered .
here you go !
thanks , elo@@ die .
look at this sco@@ und@@ rel .
no wonder his plate emp@@ tied so fast !
show me your nap@@ kin .
it 's for a kit@@ ten .
a kit@@ ten ?
you think we 're stupid ?
no , i swear it !
a kit@@ ten eating po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
that 'll be the day !
come on , give it to me .
no , wait !
don 't throw it out !
why not ?
you 'll see .
go ahead , put it in .
that way , we 'll have an hour or two to our@@ selves .
yes , you 're right .
here you go , olivier .
go feed that kit@@ ten of yours .
- thanks , jean .
- alright , scr@@ am .
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
and you turn off the light .
very well .
see you tomorrow , elo@@ die !
- no funny stuff , okay ?
- don 't worry .
your v@@ est !
thanks .
elo@@ die ...
i think we 're too soft on him .
the longer he st@@ ays the more he gets att@@ ached .
you think i 'm not getting att@@ ached ?
what are you doing here ?
thanks , kid .
sm@@ ells good !
it was better when it was hot .
it 's ve@@ al with po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
good , huh ?
del@@ icious .
i 'll eat it later .
i also have a fa@@ g .
i 'm in heaven !
that 's s@@ well !
i have something for you .
it 's an anth@@ ology on the language of flowers .
i didn 't know flowers could talk .
not on their own , of course .
if a man off@@ ers one to a woman , it spe@@ aks without making a sound .
each flower has its own meaning .
that is the language of flowers .
hey , olivier , want to join me ?
i 'm going to the basilica to see the night over paris .
i can 't go .
don 't you see i 'm chat@@ ting with my buddy ?
your loss .
girls ....
they 're such le@@ ech@@ es .
you won 't always think that .
given that a lab@@ o@@ rer ear@@ ns 35 franc per day , and works 48 weeks of 5 and half days each year , what could he set aside at the end of the year ?
a few be@@ ans , monsieur !
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , bring to me whatever you are reading .
the language of flowers ?
we have a po@@ et in our mid@@ st .
let 's see if you 've at least learned something .
what is , according to this le@@ af@@ let , the meaning of ... the o@@ ak-@@ le@@ af ger@@ an@@ ium ?
it symbol@@ iz@@ es true friend@@ ship .
that is correct .
the white japan@@ ese cam@@ ell@@ ia ?
perfect beauty .
- and the acacia ?
- eleg@@ ance , monsieur .
you see , if you want , you 'd get better gr@@ ades !
yes . yes .
- hello , m@@ ado .
- hello , olivier .
for me ?
oh , you shouldn 't have !
they are magn@@ ific@@ ent .
they didn 't cost me anything .
i went to the opening of les hal@@ les with bou@@ gr@@ as .
we gave a hand to a flower mer@@ chant .
red roses .
you know what it means when a man off@@ ers red roses to a woman ?
no , not at all .
it 's a statement of passion@@ ate love .
oh yeah ?
would you like a cup of tea ?
oh yeah ! i love tea , now .
here .
take it .
tell me , any news from your friend david ?
no .
and i wrote him so many letters .
don 't worry , i 'm sure you 'll get one soon .
i don 't care anymore .
i 'll make new friends .
that i am sure of .
now .
i must get dressed .
you stay here and finish your tea .
i just step into the other room .
i 'm keeping warm all over , my little heart is as white as a to@@ ad 's under@@ belly .
wor@@ ries , i have but a few .
troubles , i couldn 't care less .
what 's gotten over you ?
i got prom@@ ot@@ ed to film editor at pa@@ the cinema .
really ? that 's s@@ well !
you bet your ass !
i 'm starting on the new@@ s@@ re@@ els , and after that i can work ... my way up to the big movies .
that dress i saw in the galer@@ ies , maybe we can af@@ ford it , now ?
elo@@ die , i can see it right now over your shoulders .
and the tan@@ dem .
we 'll get the bike too . for our sunday out@@ ings !
oh yeah !
say !
maybe you can keep me now ?
if i have the means , olivier .
if i have the means .
you know , elo@@ die is pregnant .
can you imagine ?
a baby and you in this tiny apartment ?
you 're expecting a baby ?
well , yes .
that 's ne@@ at !
when is it due ?
well , in 5 months .
you see , it still gives you some time .
anyway , i 'm really happy for you .
i forgot , olivier !
you must hurry .
mr. pri@@ vat came to see you .
mr. pri@@ vat ?
he 's in paris ?
yes , just a sto@@ po@@ ver .
he 's waiting for you at the mar@@ ca@@ det palace to see a movie .
so go !
you got@@ ta hurry .
don 't forget your v@@ est !
when our teacher tal@@ ks about the war , he never men@@ tions any of this .
is that how it really was ?
far worse .
it was a s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ house .
i shouldn 't have brought you to see this .
for a child , it 's too sad .
i remember a time .
papa would always say : " that fucking war . "
what was my dad like ?
i 've told you already .
you father and i were friends long before the war .
he was in@@ ju@@ red during the as@@ sault on the marne .
he wrote me saying they had cap@@ tured lots of german soldiers ... completely drunk from gu@@ zz@@ ling too much champagne .
ours !
our champagne !
he got hurt two days later , during a counter@@ - strike .
your dad was right :
" fucking war ! "
my mom would always answer him ... that it was thanks to the war they got married .
father was wo@@ unded and mother was the nurse , and that 's how it all started .
it 's a beautiful story .
yes , olivier .
it 's a beautiful story .
come on .
there 's bou@@ gr@@ as !
he 's a sand@@ wich man , now ?
play@@ bill ?
one for you .
get your play@@ bill right here .
he 's my buddy .
i 'll introdu@@ ce you .
hey , hey , my artiller@@ y@@ man , on vac@@ ation i see ?
enjoying the fl@@ ick ?
good day , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as .
i 'd like you to meet mr. pri@@ vat . he was my mother 's best friend .
we just saw the wooden cros@@ ses .
it was well done .
in ter@@ ms of blood@@ ba@@ ths , this one was well done , yes .
you got nothing better to do than take him to a war film ?
you shouldn 't say that .
mr. pri@@ vat is a hero .
you 're nut@@ s if you think that !
as if there were heroes in a war .
in a war there 're only victi@@ ms and assassin@@ s .
how many krau@@ ts did he kill ?
ten ?
twenty ? fifty ?
that 's it ?
and today , we pro@@ udly sport med@@ als !
what you really want is that he ad@@ mi@@ res you .
wasn 't it enough to lose an arm ?
would it please you , if he also goes to war .
no , sir .
you 're wrong .
i wish he will never have to .
that 's what we fought for .
yeah , yeah , la-@@ de@@ e-@@ da , la-@@ de@@ e-@@ la !
yeah , i 've heard it before .
i know the tune .
you 'd better take him to luna park instead , to see charlie chap@@ lin .
it would be fun@@ nier .
ah , what the fuck .
you make me sick .
- see you later , mates !
- wait ...
bou@@ gr@@ as ...
as for you , don 't bother me .
you 're a tw@@ it , just like the others .
i don 't ever want to see you .
good morning , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as .
something wrong , olivier ?
no , i 'm fine .
it 's just that mr. bou@@ gr@@ as doesn 't want to see me anymore .
ah , i wouldn 't worry about it .
he 's a bit like me .
sometimes , we get angry at the whole world .
it comes and goes .
- want to do something for me ?
- yes , what ?
a shel@@ f came down in my room .
no sweat . after school , i 'll fix it imp@@ ec@@ cable .
- see you later .
- see you later .
there .
just like new .
thank you , olivier .
here , could you place this on the shel@@ f ?
sure .
oh , dar@@ n !
" the terrible fall of daniel . "
" daniel , king of the trap@@ eze . "
" the terrible fall .
last night in paris , during his performance ...
" at the winter cir@@ cus , the famous trap@@ eze artist daniel ...
" fell 12 m to the ground . "
" daniel 's terrible accident . "
" un@@ belie@@ v@@ able but true :
daniel still the best . "
do you know this daniel ?
he 's a buddy of yours ?
it was you ?
you were flying the trap@@ eze ?
here , that was you ?
if you don 't mind , this st@@ ays between us .
but why ?
out of van@@ ity .
you see , i still rather inspire fear than p@@ ity .
oh my , you sure have a lot of books !
oh , once i had many more .
i sol@@ d nearly all of them .
everyone has to eat .
what a shame .
i 've become att@@ ached to this neigh@@ bour@@ hood , to this street .
i wouldn 't want to leave it and wind up in an old people 's home , even if i was better off , given my condition .
i understand you .
i don 't want to leave either .
and why would you ?
jean and elo@@ die will soon have a baby .
when the baby is born , they won 't be able to keep me .
there might a way .
look , behind the cup@@ board . that 's your cousin 's place .
so that means i sleep right over there .
i say , that is funny !
here , i 'd like to give you a book .
not just any book , mind you .
it 's a bit thick , but once you 've read it , life and books will no longer hold secrets for you .
pretty heavy , hey ?
it 's the weight of knowledge .
" am@@ ou@@ il@@ lante ,
" nou@@ n , feminine and ad@@ jec@@ tive :

" amor ,
" latin word meaning love :
" physical or emo@@ tional attr@@ action of one person toward another , "
" physical or emo@@ tional attr@@ action of one person toward another . "
cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re .
five . and i went easy on you .
you obviously want to be a box@@ er , but it looks like ... you forgot to take your glo@@ ves off before starting your es@@ say .
lo@@ ul@@ ou .
zero .
not a bad piece , even funny at times .
however , gang@@ ster is not a profes@@ sion .
if your ide@@ als only tend toward dou@@ gh , sho@@ o@@ ters and broad@@ s , you 'll hit the slam@@ mer faster than a jac@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
why did your write your es@@ say in verse ?
i don 't know , it 's more beautiful !
" he who pus@@ hes his tal@@ ents accompl@@ ishes nothing with grace , " my child .
anyway , i do see the effort .
and in ter@@ ms of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , you went the extra mile .
however ... i do ask myself , why do all of your aspir@@ ations start with the letter a ?
you con@@ templ@@ ate becoming an : acro@@ bat , archit@@ ect , administrat@@ or , athle@@ te , ar@@ mo@@ rer , avi@@ ator , amb@@ ass@@ ador , astr@@ olog@@ er , anthro@@ pol@@ og@@ ist ... and artist@@ ic ly@@ ric@@ ist .
careful not to spread yourself too thin .
i gave you an 8 .
it 's a little har@@ sh , but see it as an encour@@ ag@@ ement .
ernest .
i would have liked to see you become as imagin@@ ative .
you 'd like to be a coff@@ e@@ e-@@ shop ow@@ ner , like papa .
excuse me , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et .
children , our country is facing hard times .
president dou@@ mer was shot down at noon today by a mad@@ man .
his situation is ho@@ pel@@ ess .
consequ@@ ently , you will all go home to your parents .
and tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mour@@ ning .
- yeah !
all this will finish badly , very badly ...
and so , in this edition , we 'll follow the funeral of president paul dou@@ mer ... and the resul@@ ts of the legislat@@ ive elections , and also the le@@ ft@@ ist swing in par@@ li@@ ament .
so ... for dou@@ mer 's funeral , we went all out .
we have 7 camer@@ as .
one at the entrance and exit of the ely@@ see , and all along the proces@@ sion route in paris .
this way , we 'll have a good as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment of the crowd : tens of thous@@ ands of mour@@ ners .
the assas@@ sin :
gor@@ yo@@ ul@@ ov .
it 's the only record we have .
we have no foot@@ age .
and we 'll end with the elections .
it 's familiar ground , but at least we 'll give out some resul@@ ts .
the left w@@ ins 91 se@@ ats .
lights !
that 's good .
it 's good , but i want everything ... you 've got on the assassin@@ ation and funeral of dou@@ mer .
nobody car@@ es about the elections .
especially since your foot@@ age is as dul@@ l as dis@@ h@@ water .
yes , you 're right .
sir , although the foot@@ age of dou@@ mer 's funeral is powerful , the real important event are the elections .
for the first time in many years , the left reg@@ ained a major@@ ity !
young man , the people want to see something spectac@@ ular .
the face of charles lind@@ ber@@ gh when told about the death of his son , or the s@@ kat@@ er sonia hen@@ ie , or dou@@ mer on his death bed ; not what they read about 3 days before .
agreed . but we can 't down@@ play the up@@ surge by the left .
first of all , the left is not yet the rul@@ ing party .
second , learn to mind your own business .
oh , but it is my business !
i 'm a cit@@ izen just like you .
alright . we 'll see about that later .
you should have seen the way i na@@ iled the produc@@ er today !
he didn 't even want to talk about the elections !
aren 't you 're not pushing your luck ?
you just started there . i know you with your big mouth !
oh , don 't get me started !
what do you call this ?
- it 's a surprise .
- really ?
who made this hole in the wall ?
don 't worry .
the land@@ lord made it .
oh yeah ?
what for ? well , when the neigh@@ b@@ our moved out , i told the land@@ lord we needed more space for the baby .
- he had to study the wall 's integr@@ ity .
- did he say yes ?
yes . he 'll come to talk about rais@@ ing the rent .
that would be fantast@@ ic !
we wouldn 't have to move to a larger flat .
right .
l '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee used to live here .
yes . this morning , he was taken to the old people 's home .
he asked to be taken .
he found it harder to get up the stairs .
we won 't see him anymore ?
well , one man 's loss is another man 's gain .
listen , before chec@@ king out , he left some books for you .
have a look .
- may i say something ?
- go ahead .
with this room , if i sleep here ... i 'll be less of a bur@@ den .
we want this to be the baby 's room .
i know , but in the mean@@ time .
you , when your mind is set on something ...
alright , then .
until the baby is born , you can squ@@ at .
- yeah !
- and tomorrow , i 'll take you to the studio . you 'll work all day as an extra on a movie set .
look at that .
- what a beauty !
- it 's a del@@ age .
last word of ad@@ vice : when you 're on the set , and the red light is on , you got@@ ta shut up .
- especially when you hear the cl@@ apper .
- understood . and never look in the camera .
let 's go say hello .
- good morning , fern@@ and .
- jean , i need to talk to you . the kid 's an extra for the day . i 'm taking him now on the set .
jean , it 's not about the kid .
it 's about you . you can 't go in anymore .
you 're jo@@ king , right !
no , i 'm not jo@@ king . they 're letting you go .
here 's you 're last pay .
i 'm fired ? just like that ?
i want to see a manager !
the boss is not here this morning .
come back this afternoon .
but i doubt they 'll change their min@@ ds .
well i won 't take this lying down .
they don 't know who they 're de@@ aling with .
i 'm not going !
no . you must go .
we 'll take the other street and bl@@ end in with the ex@@ tras .
- jean ! - don 't give me a rough time .
- but , jean !
why must you always talk about polit@@ ics ?
how will we manage now with the land@@ lord ?
we 'll have to pay for the hole .
i 'm sure we 'll find a solution .
did you see about getting your job back as a boom oper@@ ator ?
ye@@ p . they already filled the position .
but that can 't be !
why must this be happening to us right now ?
here .
my wag@@ es for being an extra .
you can have it .
i hope it hel@@ ps to pay for the baby 's room .
now there 's a repe@@ at performance !
we 're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself .
you don 't care about us .
you just want to make sure you can live here ! no , jean .
that 's not true , i swear it .
i swear it !
you 're sel@@ fish !
hypo@@ cr@@ ite !
i don 't want your fucking dou@@ gh !
listen ! i 'm out of action .
there 's no way we can support you .
get the hell out !
but , jean !
why did you tell him that ?
hey , kit@@ ty .
min@@ ou .
come back !
fire !
fire ! fire !
hey , where do you think you 're going ?
did you start this fire ?
you 're in big trouble you little br@@ at !
- but i didn 't do anything , sir .
- and this , what do you call this ?
why did you start this fire , miser@@ able ar@@ son@@ ist .
- you 're parents will have to pay .
- they 're both dead .
you don 't get off that easy .
anymore tr@@ icks up your sle@@ eve ?
leave him alone .
i know this kid . he 's the haber@@ das@@ her 's or@@ phan .
- he even st@@ ole from his cous@@ ins .
- he 's a ho@@ ol@@ igan .
- he belong@@ s in a reform school !
- but i did nothing wrong !
c '@@ mon fol@@ ks , what 's this : the apo@@ calyp@@ se !
c '@@ mon , leave him alone .
this rap@@ ac@@ ious mut@@ t just set fire to a dw@@ elling of honest fol@@ ks !
" honest fol@@ ks ! " ha , ha !
show me half a dozen ! even one or two if you can !
have you never been a kid and done stupid things ?
c '@@ mon ! clear away !
c '@@ mon , hop on , kid !
c '@@ mon , c '@@ mon !
che@@ ers , mates !
rise up , rise up !
the hour is near to start the revol@@ t !
the hour is near to start the revol@@ t .
y@@ ip@@ per !
now my ol@@ ive .
hang in there . it 's all over .
will i have to go to reform school ?
of course not . no reform school .
you 're with jean and elo@@ die , you 're not alone .
as a matter of fact , jean lost his job .
- they can 't keep me anymore .
- shit . talk about bad luck .
i sure hope i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee didn 't leave for nothing .
why do you say that ?
he made me swear i wouldn 't tell anyone , especially you .
he left his room for your benef@@ it .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
he wanted you to stay .
so he arrang@@ ed a meeting ... between elo@@ die and the land@@ lord .
but i didn 't want him to leave !
- tell me it 's not true .
- i 'm afraid it is .
that 's why you can 't go .
do you understand ?
c '@@ mon , artiller@@ y@@ man , we can 't lose hope , right ?
you 'll see , things will work out for jean .
and that little mis@@ hap with the fire , it 's nothing serious .
not at all ...
besides , nothing should be taken seriously .
- so you 're not angry with me anymore ?
- angry ?
- oh , it 's you .
- ye@@ p , it 's me . i forgot my keys .
elo@@ die !
elo@@ die . are you there ?
- no .
she 'll be back later tonight .
- what are you talking about ?
ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tique .
- but the trans@@ at is closed in the evening .
- no , no . it 's the ann@@ ual dinner of the mont@@ mar@@ tre fel@@ low@@ ship alum@@ ni .
it will end late .
and you , what 's new ?
nothing .
i 've been looking for work for over a month .
" sorry , sir , there is nothing . "
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
fucking crisis !
one of these days , the ke@@ g will blow !
the mis@@ ers will still get away with it , but not for long !
they 'll get what 's coming to them !
we 'll make min@@ cem@@ eat out of them !
you hear me , olivier ?
look at what i prepared .
stu@@ ffed tom@@ ato@@ es !
- you made this ?
mother taught me how .
- i 'll get it , i 'll get it .
- no , stay here , i 'll get it .
- oh . it 's the char@@ ming m@@ ado !
- good evening , jean .
well , do come in , come in .
sorry to distur@@ b you ...
i was supposed to go out with a girlfriend , but her mom fell sick .
- so i thought maybe you would like to ...
no .
not exactly .
i was thinking more about olivier ...
there is no school tomorrow , i promised to take him to the restaurant .
if that would make him happy .
right olivier ?
would you like to go out with m@@ ado ?
oh yes , jean .
thank you !
i won 't bring him back late .
i hope not !
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
here . i brought you a tie so you 'll look eleg@@ ant .
thank you .
i 'll put it on right now . and some gom@@ ina gel .
alright , get a move on !
so ... everything arrang@@ ed for tomorrow ?
you 're certain ?
yes .
at what time they 'll pick him up ?
at 2 pm . his uncle henri will pick him up .
poor kid ...
he 's doesn 't know yet ?
no .
it will be a terrible blow .
yes , i know .
anyway , thanks for taking him out tonight .
i really like him , you know .
i 'm ready !
oh , my . really clas@@ sy , olivier !
monsieur will taste the wine .
ah , it is good , huh !
a little warm .
it is not warm , young man , it is ambi@@ ent .
my friend bou@@ gr@@ as says the saint-@@ em@@ il@@ ion is better when brought up from the cell@@ ar .
would you have a bottle from the cell@@ ar ?
we do . but if i may , i would not re@@ commen@@ d it .
but monsieur maurice !
if it 's madame 's wish , we get a bottle from the cell@@ ar .
and may madame and monsieur enjoy an excellent meal .
thank you .
les@@ son number 5 : the client is king .
forgive me , madame , or ma@@ demo@@ is@@ elle ... your face looks familiar .
i 'm sure we 've met before , but i don 't seem to remember .
- perhaps you can help me ?
- sir !
can 't you see i 'm with my fi@@ ance ?
and , b@@ ingo !
les@@ son number 6 :
never bother a lady if she hasn 't been introduc@@ ed to you .
to draw her attention , have a gar@@ con deli@@ ver a card .
or flowers .
- to our health !
- ah no . you must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me .
very well , m@@ ado .
you could then propose a to@@ ast , but not usually with the ladies .
was everything satisfac@@ tory ?
it was .... ex@@ quis@@ ite !
- i would like some sweet stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries .
- and for the young man ?
how about a nice paris-@@ brest ?
it 's very good .
- isn 't that a bic@@ y@@ cle race ?
- no , it 's also a cake .
- sir , do you have plu@@ m pu@@ d@@ ding ?
- most certainly .
- let 's go for the plu@@ m pu@@ d@@ ding !
- very well , monsieur .
apparently , it 's as good as love .
i 'd like to thank you again , m@@ ado .
it was really ... really ... rom@@ antic !
- ah , i 'll give you back the tie .
- no .
keep it . you 'll have a sou@@ venir of me .
a sou@@ venir ?
but we 'll see each other soon .
that 's what i meant .
you can keep it forever .
alright .
so long , gentlem@@ an .
elo@@ die !
elo@@ die !
hello , ernest .
what did he say ? - nothing .
i didn 't tell him .
- what ?
you were supposed to tell him last night .
henri will arrive in half an hour .
but surely , we must tell him now .
i was wondering if we couldn 't keep him .
listen , jean , we 're not starting that again .
it 's not possible .
god knows when you 'll find a job .
and in 3 months i won 't be able to work because of the baby . i 'm sad too .
but that 's how it is . nothing we can do . elo@@ die .
the order for no@@ .@@ 4 ! be right there !
it 's coming .
bon appe@@ tit .
where is he now ?
he bor@@ rowed your fire cups to treat bou@@ gr@@ as .
well , you 're going to tell him right now .
almost done ?
- only two more to go .
- ah well , go for it .
fir@@ ing up !
oh , my !
if you can he@@ al me with those , i 'll buy you a drink .
mother would often treat me .
she said it 's better than medi@@ cation .
okay , do the last one .
fir@@ ing up !
o@@ oh , that one 's really hot .
now all we have to do is wait .
come in !
gre@@ et@@ ings , bou@@ gr@@ as !
gre@@ et@@ ings , jean .
so , you 're playing doctor , now ?
he 's good at it too . my lord !
it 's gon@@ na be a hot day .
does that surprise you ?
it is after all , the beginning of jul@@ y .
you know , olivier , in life , there are events more serious than others .
but they shouldn 't lead us to over@@ -@@ dramat@@ ize .
everything works out .
all one needs is to show a little will@@ power .
isn 't that so ?
yes .
olivier , i want you to listen to me .
i have news to tell you .
don 't worry , it 's actually good news .
as you know , henri has become your legal guardian .
that means ... you 'll be like his son .
can you imagine just how lucky you are ?
don 't look so glo@@ om@@ y .
you know we did everything we could to keep you .
but in the long run , it 's for your own good .
from now on , you 'll live in a large apartment , with wal@@ l-@@ to-@@ wall car@@ pet@@ s .
two hous@@ em@@ aids .
two !
you 'll be able to go to college and get a real education .
not to mention , lucky dog , a summer vac@@ ation in tour@@ aine .
a few dozen hectar@@ es , apparently .
you 'll be living like a king !
we didn 't want to tell you so@@ oner so as not to ... as not to ...
well , that 's it .
your uncle 's car should arrive soon .
you mean now ?
right now ? well , yes .
right now .
but couldn 't i go stay with pri@@ vat instead ?
that , my boy , is your fault .
you had your chance .
now .
i go down to wait for the car .
i 'll let you know .
i got@@ ta pack a suit@@ case .
no .
you won 't have to .
it 's already pack@@ ed .
it 's at the trans@@ at .
so long , bou@@ gr@@ as .
take those yo@@ gur@@ t j@@ ars off of me .
c '@@ mon , do it quick .
you 'll see , mr. bou@@ gr@@ as .
usually , if all goes well , in one hour , you should be feeling better .
i 'm sure i 'm will .
thank you , my l@@ ad .
you 've been a good nurse .
you took good care of me .
never mind that , i 'll put those away .
is olivier ready ?
now , now , artiller@@ y@@ man .
you 're not gon@@ na start wh@@ in@@ ing ?
you 're not a girl are you ?
no , mr. bou@@ gr@@ as .
c '@@ mon , then ...
let 's shake on it , for old time 's sake ?
it 's for me ?
i can 't take it .
it 's too nice .
i can 't .
there you go .
c '@@ mon , get out of here my ol@@ ive .
c '@@ mon .
get out of here . sc@@ at !
go !
come on , olivier , you 're not saying goodbye ?
don 't worry , you 'll be like our son , now .
so long , ol@@ ive .
you 're in luck .
take a load of this car !
goodbye , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
- see you soon , olivier !
- goodbye , ol@@ ive !
you like min@@ t lol@@ lipo@@ ps , i think .
where are we going , uncle ?
your place ?
you know , we had a look at your school gr@@ ades , you 'll need classes this summer to catch up .
the director was categor@@ ical .
the director ?
the director of the college where you will now further your studies .
it 's a good estab@@ l@@ ishment . you 'll see .
and one of the best in chur@@ ning out succes@@ s@@ ful students .
mar@@ ceau , our son , atten@@ ded this college .
even got an award for latin in the main con@@ test event .
how un@@ fortun@@ ate he 's not as heal@@ thy as you !
your mother wanted you to get a good education .
ah ... here we are .
i 'll spend the entire summer here ?
but you 'll see , you 'll enjoy it here .
come , let 's go see the director .
say , how long are you staying in tour@@ aine , with your del@@ age ?
my chau@@ ff@@ eur is pr@@ ud@@ ent , but still it 's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km .
all the same , it 's fantast@@ ic . what will they think of next ?
this will be your bed .
please remember to pass along my reg@@ ards to your wife and to mar@@ ceau .
- how is he ? - doing fine .
we hope to bring him home by the end of this summer .
however , with this ill@@ ness , a sword of dam@@ oc@@ les always hang@@ s above our heads .
i share your concer@@ ns .
- dear uncle , may i ... - two minutes .
olivier .
i hope you 'll be as bright as your cousin .
uncle , i need to use the to@@ il@@ et !
have you been following gor@@ go@@ ul@@ ov 's tri@@ al ?
it 's an ab@@ omin@@ ation !
ah , is the child 's uniform ready ?
it 's the right size .
at least , i hope .
here you go my boy , try this on for me .
what 's the matter with you ?
he pissed himself !
- oliver ... what 's wrong with you ?
- never mind , i 'll take care of it .
come with me , you fil@@ thy little boy .
i beg your for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , m. le directeur .
make nothing of it .
how long ago did his mother pass away ?
4 or 5 months .
i 'm worried we might have been a little hast@@ y in all of this .
would you mind if i kept him for this evening ?
no , not at all .
i 'll try to che@@ er him up .
do you like to go see ma@@ yol , the singer ?
not really , uncle .
what then would please you ?
- i 'd love to go to the lap@@ in ag@@ ile .
- the cab@@ aret in mont@@ mar@@ tre ?
that estab@@ l@@ ishment does not allow children .
i used to go with my mother .
" par@@ le@@ z-@@ moi d '@@ amour
" re@@ dit@@ es-@@ moi des choses ten@@ dres
" vo@@ tre beau discours
" mon co@@ eur n '@@ est pas las de l '@@ ent@@ endre
" pour@@ vu que toujours
" vous repe@@ ti@@ ez ces mots supre@@ mes "
it 's funny ...
the last time i was here with mama , we were sitting at this very table .
why ever would your mother bring you here ?
we came to dance .
tang@@ os , especially .
olivier , are you crying ?
no .
it 's nothing .
we should not have come here .
it will only make you miser@@ able . no .
on the contr@@ ary .
i 'm happy .
very happy .
careful , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
your uncle could have brought you back so@@ oner .
go to bed now . go on .
that should te@@ ach you not to wake everybody up .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , don 't be a sho@@ w-@@ off .
i run a quiet dor@@ m and it will stay that way .
we 're not in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
- but it wasn 't me , sir . - silence !
we don 't answer back , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
and now , go to sleep . everybody .
you 're a s@@ nit@@ ch , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
did you hear that ?
he 's from mont@@ mar@@ tre .
and already s@@ nit@@ ching on us !
no one tal@@ ks to him .
he 's now on quar@@ ant@@ ine .
- yeah , good idea .
- silence !
hey ur@@ chin . you can 't play with us .
we don 't need you .
de@@ bezie@@ ux . well done : 16 / 20 .
sar@@ on , almost perfect .
once again , you 've ear@@ ned 19 .
i kept the best for last .
no , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f did not get 20 .
after only 2 months , i wouldn 't expect as much from him .
luc@@ kil@@ y for him , there are no marks below zero , because chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f would have sco@@ red -@@ 6.5 .
and for your enjo@@ y@@ ment , i will demonstr@@ ate how chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f ... trans@@ lat@@ es the famous phrase :
" if you want peace
" prepare for war . "
you haven 't made any progress during the summer , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
being mr. des@@ rous@@ seau 's neph@@ ew or not , you are not exemp@@ t from being intellig@@ ent .
follow your cousin mar@@ ceau 's ex@@ ample . he was my best student .
good morning , olivier .
i 'm mar@@ ceau , your cousin .
we 've met at the house on a few occas@@ ions .
it 's pretty hard to forget .
my latin teacher never stop@@ s talking about you .
good morning , mar@@ ceau .
no need to be formal , l@@ ad .
you 're a po@@ et ?
we 'll understand each other !
" child of a fallen le@@ af ,
" subj@@ ec@@ ted to every wind
" as the weeks and months of summer pass
" wrapped in the sheets of my friends ' sol@@ itude
" i call the names of bou@@ gr@@ as , m@@ ado , i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee
" no answer to be heard . they have forgotten me .
" and so i ask :
what has become of them ?
" you , my parents as distant as strang@@ ers be
" what secrets have you not dar@@ ed share with me ? "
not bad .
insp@@ i@@ red by ru@@ te@@ be@@ uf , and a bit of a te@@ ar@@ jer@@ ker , but ... given your situation , this piece is fit@@ ting .
that poem is private !
perhaps i should te@@ ach you the fin@@ er aspec@@ ts of caes@@ ura .
i don 't need your help .
couldn 't i be of use to you in latin ?
- what about your sister ?
- mind your own business .
i 'm starting to like you , ob@@ sc@@ ure little friend .
i was afraid you would bor@@ e me .
my parents dum@@ ped you here for the whole summer ?
ah , the bastar@@ ds !
they could have brought you with them to tour@@ aine at least !
i sympath@@ ize . i spent the last 8 months in the sanat@@ orium .
i 'm cu@@ red , finally . i 'm just out and i bring you back home !
isn 't life beautiful ?
the head@@ master will never con@@ sent .
you 're mother p@@ icks me up tomorrow .
ni@@ hil obst@@ at .
i 've just seen the principal , and , between two latin qu@@ otes , i 've told him that my mother had instruc@@ ted me to take you home . you are free .
i release you from the bon@@ ds of sla@@ very .
long live freedom !
long live andre breton !
- who 's this breton ?
- the po@@ pe of sur@@ realis@@ m , of course !
the po@@ pe of what ? my god !
i 'll need to tend to your education .
you are now enter@@ ing the holy of hol@@ ies .
you may enter .
you are familiar with this apartment ? yes .
i mean not that familiar .
you must always look im@@ pressed by the lux@@ ury ... of good standing that is the foundation of my par@@ ent 's succes@@ s .
they 're really quite vain .
mother , especially .
she 's a great lady , my mother .
she 's wonderful !
i 'm often angry with her , but i ad@@ ore her anyway .
as for my father , he 's a dre@@ amer who can 't get over having become a succes@@ s@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man .
this is the living room .
- you know what he really wanted to be ?
- an opera singer .
- how did you know that ?
- because he told me , of course !
- we went to the lap@@ in ag@@ ile together .
- that 's just like him !
he took advantage of you to get away .
you 've already reached a level of trust with him ?
yes , but he doesn 't want me talking about it .
to my mother , perhaps .
as for me , you can talk about anything .
this is the din@@ ing room .
impres@@ sive .
come , i 'll take you to your room .
put your lug@@ gage on the bed and follow me .
and this ... is my la@@ ir .
you like jazz ?
are you familiar with the duke ?
no .
what about louis armstrong ?
no , not him either .
he 's giving a paris concert at the end of this month .
can you believe it ?
either way , i 'm going to meet him this year .
my parents have offered me a trip to new york for my holid@@ ays .
getting sick does have its advantage : your parents will grant your every wish .
can you imagine ?
i 'm going to spend new year 's eve at the cot@@ ton club ...
but i have a friend who 's living in new york !
his name is david z@@ ob@@ er .
i have no news of him .
well then , give me his address .
i will find this little buddy of yours .
are you familiar with ben@@ zo@@ in ?
no .
take a seat .
you 'll get to know it .
- it 's an in@@ toxic@@ ating oil .
- for cook@@ ing ?
of course not !
i 'm talking about the mind , not the body .
do you like this piece ?
yeah , really cool .
indu@@ bit@@ ably !
duke ell@@ ington !
isn 't this dangerous for someone with tubercul@@ osis .
that , my dear , is the least of my wor@@ ries .
besides , i 'm cu@@ red .
you scared ?
no !
- you 've never smo@@ ked before ?
- yes , quite often .
some " ich li@@ f " .
my god , what an accent !
high life ! " vie elevee . "
high life .
you will experience the elev@@ ation of soul@@ s , the commun@@ ion of spir@@ its .
you see , me ... i would come across as a type of laf@@ ca@@ dio .
who 's that ?
- the vatic@@ an cel@@ lars .
andre gide .
you know him ? - no .
the perfect crime .
when you think of it , the sanat@@ orium had its mer@@ its .
i learned the two things a man must lose in his life .
his virgin@@ ity and his il@@ lus@@ ions .
here .
" there , everything is order and beauty ,
" lux@@ ury , seren@@ ity and vol@@ up@@ tuo@@ us@@ ness . "
what is vol@@ up@@ tuo@@ us@@ ness ?
that is about to manif@@ est .
don 't move , i 'll be right back .
olivier .
i 'd like you to meet jul@@ ienne , my mother 's go@@ d-@@ daughter , resi@@ dent of the demo@@ is@@ elles de la legion d '@@ honneur .
she holds my mother 's de@@ ar@@ est fer@@ vor ... when it comes to my marriage .
- jul@@ ienne , i 'd like to present ...
- i know him , mar@@ ceau .
- you 're the one who 's mother died .
- yes , that 's me .
out of kind@@ ness my parents decided to adop@@ t him .
would you like a ben@@ zo@@ in ci@@ g@@ gy ?
no , thank you .
my feet are killing me .
saint-denis is quite the walking distance .
olivier , make yourself use@@ ful .
jul@@ ienne has sore feet .
re@@ move her shoes .
come on , hurry up .
slowly , olivier !
un@@ lace them gently .
give them a mas@@ sage .
my feet are really sore .
don 't tic@@ kle me .
just give me a mas@@ sage .
look .
have you ever seen a woman before ?
have you ever seen a woman 's bre@@ asts ?
oh , you little sco@@ und@@ rel !
you 're a per@@ vert !
how dare you !
this is not your place .
now go to your room !
scr@@ am !
write me a poem about jul@@ ienne 's bre@@ asts .
- ma '@@ am , where would you like this lug@@ gage ?
- carry them to my room .
marguerite , tell the chau@@ ff@@ eur to bring in the app@@ les last .
we 'll put them in the store room .
which is master olivier 's room , now
very well , madame .
good day , mother .
did you have a nice trip ? - excellent !
where were you ?
- at the restaurant , with olivier .
we weren 't going to die of star@@ v@@ ation a@@ waiting your return .
come now .
give me a hug instead of making vile re@@ marks .
- how do you feel ?
- i feel great .
let me have a look at you .
you 're right , you do look well .
why did you bring olivier back a day so@@ oner ?
you could have let me know .
i could have avo@@ i@@ ded the de@@ tour to the college .
listen , he 'd been cou@@ ped up long enough , don 't you think ?
good day , olivier .
good day , aunt .
i suppose mar@@ ceau has already given you the grand tour ?
he has , yes .
very well . we 'll now go to your room .
since you are here , i will give you ...
- the house rules !
- that 's mean !
i hope you 'll be comfortable here .
this is where we keep the app@@ les that we bring back ... every year from our estate in mon@@ trich@@ ard .
fortunately for you , the har@@ v@@ est was not abun@@ dant this year .
i hope you like apple sau@@ ce and apple pie .
here we eat it all the time .
- these are your belong@@ ings ?
- yes , aunt .
but they re@@ ek !
well , we 'll need to get rid of them .
including the clothes you are wearing .
i will let you have mar@@ ceau 's old things . you can tell mother is from auverg@@ ne :
to her , a sp@@ ade is a sp@@ ade .
my dear child , you used to be more wit@@ ty .
- these books are yours ?
- yes , aunt .
marie bas@@ h@@ kir@@ t@@ se@@ ff ?
how un@@ expected !
sch@@ open@@ hauer ?
you mean you 're reading this at your age ?
- no , aunt .
- it so happens he has ... a certain culture .
i 've read one of his poem@@ s . it 's quite good .
anyway , what he needs most is a good bath .
i will ask marguerite to wash him in the laun@@ dry room . that 's right .
we wouldn 't want him st@@ aining the ba@@ th@@ tu@@ b .
come on , marguerite , s@@ cru@@ b harder . he 's got to shine like a new penny .
your cousin is a cute little angel .
- more so than moi , marguerite ?
- that 's not the same thing .
you 're a man , now .
alright , olivier .
come out and dry yourself .
hop , hop !
vo@@ ila !
i say , aren 't we a we@@ e bit sc@@ raw@@ ny , my little ur@@ chin ?
alright .
i 'm going to burn your clothes like madame said .
show me , olivier .
now , turn around .
it 's funny seeing you wear my old tr@@ app@@ ings .
" tr@@ app@@ ings " ?
ah , what an ast@@ ute word .
do i detec@@ t mont@@ mar@@ tre 's influence ?
mar@@ ceau , your father and i decided ... to prepare a little surprise for your home@@ coming .
jul@@ ienne will join us for dinner this evening .
she will be happy to see you .
she spoke so often of you .
your father is picking her up at the print shop after work .
- are you pleased ?
- yes , mother .
i burn !
oh how i langu@@ ish for jul@@ ienne !
i love her , not as in the under@@ world , the rav@@ ager of a thousand men , but fa@@ ith@@ ful , proud and a little diff@@ id@@ ent !
the divine ...
- good evening .
- good evening , monsieur .
god@@ mother !
good evening , god@@ mother .
my dear , how happy i am to see you .
and i 'm not the only one .
mar@@ ceau is thril@@ led that you could join us for his home@@ coming .
it 's been such a long time since you 've last seen each other .
that 's true !
i even wondered if i would recognize you !
can you imagine ?
it 's now been over a year .
seems to me like it was yesterday .
and your father , do you recognize him ?
a your age you only change every 10 years .
at my age ?
am i that old ?
anyway , you have a much better disposition than when you left .
good to see you .
good .
let us have dinner so that jul@@ ienne doesn 't get home too late .
i must get you to test drive my new del@@ age .
jul@@ ienne .
where 's olivier 's setting ?
in the kitchen .
he 's eating with the ma@@ ids , of course .
why then did you tell him he was a member of the family ?
they cu@@ red his ill@@ ness , but apparently not his character .
thank you .
mar@@ ceau , return immediately to the din@@ ing room .
your ste@@ w is truly mar@@ vel@@ ous , blanche .
thank you , m. mar@@ ceau .
for the last time , return to the din@@ ing room .
del@@ icious , don 't you think ?
blanche , see to it that m. olivier jo@@ ins us in the din@@ ing room .
- yes , madame .
- dear aunt , there 's is no need .
oh please , don 't give me that !
come on , let 's go .
look , olivier .
like this .
sorry , aunt .
it 's not your fault , olivier .
take note however that we don 't say : " sorry , " but " please excuse me . "
in conclusion , olivier , we are too good for you .
well my friend , say something .
yes .
be nice to your mother , mar@@ ceau .
what is that dress you 're wearing ?
ro@@ chas ? po@@ ire@@ t ?
no , sch@@ i@@ apar@@ elli .
what else you 'd like to know ?
i do like it .
- however ... - yes ?
your neck@@ lace doesn 't suit it .
a little flas@@ hy , don 't you think ?
we can discus@@ s it further after our meal , if you like .
excellent idea , mother .
besides , after our little cafe , you and jul@@ ienne could play us a du@@ et ?
with pleasure , go@@ d-@@ mother .
with pleasure , mother .
with pleasure , aunt .
olivier !
if you want us to keep you , you must change your attitude .
go to your room immediately .
- but , aunt ...
- immediately !
very well , aunt .
you 're worse than hitler .
mar@@ ceau , ill@@ ness doesn 't excuse everything .
i need no exc@@ uses , mother . and i 'm not longer ill .
mar@@ ceau ...
mar@@ ceau !
mar@@ ceau , wake up !
wake up !
please , wake up !
i 'm okay . don 't move .
you had a spell .
i 'll get your mother .
no , olivier .
you didn 't see a thing .
but it might be serious .
you must see a doctor .
listen , olivier .
all the tests indic@@ ate i am cu@@ red .
makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fat@@ ig@@ ue .
mar@@ ceau !
olivier , if you are a brother to me , swear you 'll never speak about this to anyone .
okay ?
come on , swear it .
i swear , mar@@ ceau .
thanks , olivier .
... we are pleased to have him join a jam session , a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e for mister ...
louis armstrong !
i just cut my lip .
don 't mention anything to my divine .
you swear ?
dear students , some of you might wonder why ... you would need to learn latin .
the po@@ pe , monsieur . no .
now pick a word at random . - light . - perfect ex@@ ample of latin ro@@ ots .
light comes from the word lu@@ x , the light .
something that is lu@@ x-@@ ur@@ ious is something that is brilli@@ ant .
your turn to choose a word , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
po@@ etr@@ y .
po@@ etr@@ y comes from the latin word po@@ esis , which in turn comes from the gre@@ ek po@@ i@@ esis , meaning creation .
dele@@ pine , which word would you like to know the ro@@ ot of ?
football .
now here 's an ex@@ ample of a barbar@@ ic term we adop@@ ted , let alone its simple trans@@ lation in our language .
" football , " in our language should mean :
ball at the foot , from the latin pedi@@ bus , meaning foot and ... excuse me ...
medical examin@@ ation visit .
- i said in silence . - visit . from the word vis .
to see . and medical , from medi@@ cus , the doctor .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f ? yes , that 's me .
- this is a surprise , olivier ! - good day , mr. leh@@ man .
i mean , doctor .
- i was about to ask you the same thing .
so did i. the number of pati@@ ents i had in my care was d@@ wind@@ ling ;
good , now open wide .
i hate myself for what happened to your mother .
perhaps i didn 't do enough for her .
- you didn 't like me very much , did you ?
- well ...
believe me , i didn 't want to take your father 's place , olivier .
i just wanted to help your mother . in any event , she didn 't like you .
i think she did a bit . now , sit straight .
for you it 's very sad . she died so young .
i see your aunt is taking good care of you .
everything is fine .
you 're in perfect health . that 's it . you can get dressed , now .
thank you , doctor .
tell me doctor ?
- i would like to ask you ...
- yes ?
when people get ... when they come down with tubercul@@ osis , can they get sick again , even after being cu@@ red ?
of course .
the terrible thing about this ill@@ ness , a real cure still hasn 't been found .
if we cou@@ gh up blood , it means we 're still sick ?
yes , and it 's really serious .
it 's typ@@ ical , as are repeated cou@@ gh@@ s , and sometimes even loss of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
- is it con@@ tag@@ ious ?
- oh yes , extre@@ mely con@@ tag@@ ious ! but why are you asking me this ? well ...
i want to write a poem on tubercul@@ osis .
on tubercul@@ osis ? yes , why not ?
it 's true , lam@@ art@@ ine ...
la dame aux cam@@ elias . thank you , doctor .
you 'll make yourself sick reading so much !
are those shoes ready yet , marguerite ?
yes , all done , madame .
good evening , olivier .
reading is a heal@@ thy ha@@ bit , olivier , but not at the table .
what are you reading ?
still reading without family !
but i gave you that one over a month ago .
i love reading it over again .
gr@@ ant@@ ed . but there are other books more essenti@@ al .
you look lovely , dear aunt .
well , aren 't you the gal@@ lant one !
this evening go@@ wn is for the french club .
henri is taking me . you should say to the " comedie
- francaise , " mother .
how could he possibly understand , he 's unver@@ sed .
i know it 's saturday , but getting up at sun@@ set is a bit ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , don 't you think ?
mother , i 'm prepar@@ ing myself for the time difference .
it is now 11 o '@@ clock in new york . don 't plan too far ahead , mar@@ ceau .
your trip is not official yet . don 't forget .
come , my little out@@ cast , i need to speak with you .
thank you , marguerite . you won 't believe what 's happening to me .
i 'm in love ! i met a woman yesterday at a party ga@@ thering .
- what party ?
- the commun@@ ist party !
you know , the reds . she 's simply amazing .
a mix between louise brooks and rosa luxemburg .
she 's a sur@@ real@@ ist like me .
a dream come true .
there 's just one problem : she 's 15 years older .
i want to read you a poem i wrote her .
" crim@@ son heart , pier@@ ced by faith ,
" may he who has never loved you never reach your dep@@ th . "
not bad for a start , don 't you think ? i 'm brilli@@ ant .
go ahead , tell me .
" mar@@ ceau , you 're brilli@@ ant . "
- mar@@ ceau , you 're brilli@@ ant .
- oh no , it 's pa@@ the@@ tic .
you can 't really understand po@@ etr@@ y . you 're stuck on victor hugo or le@@ conte de lis@@ le .
you know nothing about women .
you 've never been in love .
i know nothing about women ?
her name is m@@ ado .
and she 's a ta@@ xi@@ -@@ girl . - besides , we 're engag@@ ed .
- come on .
don 't make up stories just to try to im@@ press me .
you 'll see if i 'm telling the truth . you 'll see . come .
here .
rin@@ se your eyes on this .
she gave it me as a mem@@ ento .
to someone else , you mean !
you probably st@@ ole it from your mother 's bou@@ tique .
nice piece , though .
and this is her calling card .
- she gave it to me person@@ ally .
you surprise me .
- are you still seeing this m@@ ado ?
- of course not .
not since my arri@@ val here . don 't look so sad .
we 'll fix that .
- very pretty ! look . i just started a new nov@@ el .
- can you read it to me ?
- yes , of course .
" i was born , like everyone , from a mother and a father .
" and yet , i am not like everyone .
" one question haun@@ ts me :
" did my father and mother love each other ?
" were i not conce@@ iv@@ ed in a state of love , i would rather die . "
- you asked me to . you shouldn 't !
you 're viol@@ ating my inti@@ mac@@ y .
you 're a little per@@ vert ! you shouldn 't have ... you don 't understand !
it 's not because you 're older ...
you wouldn 't strike a sick person , would you ?
that 's just it , you 're really sick .
- dr leh@@ man says you 're having a rel@@ ap@@ se . - what ? who 's this dr. leh@@ man ?
you mentioned me ?
it 's the college physic@@ ian .
i asked him about tubercul@@ osis .
i know what happened to you the other day .
you were losing consci@@ ous@@ ness .
if you 're spit@@ ting blood , it 's serious and con@@ tag@@ ious .
you should in@@ form your parents .
i see where you 're going with this .
you want to stop me from leaving , send me back to the sanat@@ orium and take my place , here .
- you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau . - hypo@@ cr@@ ite !
you think i didn 't catch your little act with mother ?
" you look lovely , dear aunt . "
- as@@ s-@@ l@@ ick@@ er .
- i 'm doing it for you !
don 't forget you promised me your silence .
you 're like a brother to me .
i owe you one .
forgive me , mother .
i rather stop here .
i thought you had finally shed the awkward age , but you still rev@@ el in it .
spar@@ e me your c@@ liches .
my dear , your son is extre@@ mely ru@@ de right now .
mar@@ ceau , please !
if you want to go on your trip , you better clean up your act .
you are wanted on the telephone .
hello ! oh yes .
yes . i know who this is .
listen , it 's a delicate issue for me .
good .
i will be there in 15 minutes , under the arch@@ es .
let me see olivier .
- he 's not your child . - i know that . but i could be just like a father to him .
he chose not to go with you .
but he 's no longer in his favorite neigh@@ bour@@ hood .
please stop right there , monsieur pri@@ vat . my wife would never allow it .
on what gro@@ unds ?
you didn 't take him in out of love .
put yourself in her place .
you came to our home to kill your brother and virgin@@ ie .
and now you would want to take their son ?
i didn 't kill anyone .
and i spent time behind bars .
thir@@ teen years of my life .
i need this child to give meaning to my life .
but does he need you ?
even if we handed him over to you , think of what people would say .
believe me , i can understand your pain .
but think about the day olivier will learn everything about your past .
i 'm certain he will be able to forgive me .
but once you tell him the whole truth , you 'll be shat@@ tering the image he has of his parents .
do you think you have the right to do that ?
there 's a lad@@ der in the cour@@ t@@ yard .
you climb up , and down the other side using the street lam@@ p .
a 5 ye@@ ar-@@ old could do it . there you 'll see a bike .
you get on it , and within 10 minutes you wind up at the bou@@ chon de champagne .
here .
here 's some money to have a good time .
i 'll take your place , in case the supervis@@ or can 't sleep .
i don 't think i can pull it off .
i 'm too scared .
i 've done it do@@ zen@@ s of times without ever getting caught .
" au@@ dac@@ es fortuna ju@@ vat , " olivier .
it 's time to see if your life will be that of a she@@ ep , or if you will write it yourself , every day .
don 't you want to see m@@ ado again ?
good evening , mam '@@ z@@ elle m@@ ado good evening , m '@@ sieur hubert .
that wasn 't very smart .
are you angry with me ?
not at all !
i 'm actually moved .
you can 't follow me inside , though .
now there , don 't be sad .
wait , i have an idea .
jules ?
ask g.@@ g. to come out with his accor@@ dion .
- i have a little commission for him .
give him 10 francs , he 'll be happy .
- i 'll give him 20 ! - no , that 's too much . you asked for me , m@@ ado ?
yes , g.@@ g. here 's a young client for you .
what shall i play for you ?
olivier , what would you like ? a tango !
a tango for my little fi@@ ance .
the most beautiful tango in the world ?
- yes , that 's fine .
- i 'm not a very good dan@@ cer .
i was forced , and this is only a tempor@@ ary me@@ asure of course , to con@@ fis@@ c@@ ate this eleg@@ ant pen which arrived in the mail . - it was intended for olivier ?
- indeed , madame .
in this college , we dis@@ courage possession of val@@ u@@ able objec@@ ts ... which would risk to exc@@ ite the gre@@ ed of certain pu@@ p@@ ils ... towards their more fortun@@ ate pe@@ ers .
i thought it might be you .
i 'm not in the ha@@ bit of spo@@ iling children with gif@@ ts of this value .
- may i see olivier ? - by all means . i 've already sent for him .
he 's waiting in the vest@@ i@@ bul@@ e .
come in , olivier .
i leave you together .
good day , aunt . who sent you this pen ?
i ...
i don 't know , aunt .
don 't lie to me , olivier .
it could only have come from him .
have the courage to tell me the truth .
yes .
it is a gift from monsieur pri@@ vat .
i will send it back . you must never accept anything from this man .
but why not , aunt ?
you 're too young to know about these things .
but i need to know !
since you put it like that , i 'll tell you .
one day , in dec@@ ember of 1917 , the war was still rag@@ ing ,
pri@@ vat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun .
- he wanted to kill them , olivier .
i don 't believe you . why was my mother in@@ tent on living with him ?
i 'm still trying to figure that out . your mother and i never saw eye to eye on many things .
why didn 't you tell me so@@ oner ?
i didn 't want you to get upset .
i hope we never have to discus@@ s this matter ever again .
anyway , so@@ oner or later , you would have found out .
enter .
of course you will .
because you are pure .
wild child .
street child .
- please stop glo@@ ating at my ex@@ pense ! - you see , she dropped me . who did ?
this milit@@ ant girl who wrote these pa@@ the@@ tic lines .
i 'm down to listening to this music for rej@@ ec@@ ted lo@@ vers .
all around me ,
" everything is order and beauty . "
and yet , my pain is real . why ?
mar@@ ceau ...
you knew about ... about my parents and pri@@ vat ?
what are you talking about ?
well ...
the time pri@@ vat ... the time he came here .
your mother told me the story . the divine finally cou@@ gh@@ ed it up ?
yes .
pri@@ vat fired sho@@ ts at them .
in fact , it happened right here .
in this very room where your parents stayed . i was only 2 at the time .
but look .
look at the mirror .
imp@@ acts left by the bul@@ lets .
see where love can lead ?
a few centi@@ met@@ ers to the side ... and you 'd never have been born , my little out@@ cast .
but rest assu@@ red ,
why didn 't you tell me ?
because this story is bor@@ ing as hell , my friend .
two grown men love the same woman . an ordin@@ ary drama based on je@@ alo@@ us@@ y .
you 're mama was nothing more than a smal@@ l-@@ time god@@ dess , as my mother put it .
come on , che@@ er up .
i don 't want to see you suff@@ er , my little angel . please spar@@ e me your expres@@ sions of gran@@ deur !
we are both in@@ ju@@ red and abandon@@ ed soul@@ s .
like two star@@ lings fallen from the nest .
yes ?
m. mar@@ ceau , a girl is asking for you .
- a girl ? - ml@@ le charlotte dal@@ et . charlotte ?
have her come in , quick !
a woman leaves me , i find another . - who is she ?
- the nurse from the sanat@@ orium . - the one who ...
- who taught me how to love . - you know what you have to do ?
- change wards .
- good day , mar@@ ceau .
- charlotte ! what a joy to see you again !
i 'll give you some priv@@ acy .
stop it , mar@@ ceau .
so , if i can 't kiss you , what br@@ ings you to paris ?
i shouldn 't be telling you this , but i don 't want to dece@@ ive you .
the director will be sending a letter to your parents .
a letter ?
whatever for ? you 're having a serious rel@@ ap@@ se , mar@@ ceau .
the lab you visit for your rout@@ ine chec@@ k-@@ up@@ s ... has sent us the resul@@ ts of your samp@@ les .
the samp@@ les indic@@ ate you are once again infec@@ ted .
but you said i had been cu@@ red .
the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ thor@@ ax was extre@@ mely effec@@ tive .
but when it comes to tubercul@@ osis , you can never be sure . i must go back to the sanat@@ orium ?
i 'm afraid so .
upon your release , you regi@@ ster@@ ed less than 1000 bk .
but today , you must be well over 100.000 ! it 's a serious rel@@ ap@@ se .
you must start a new treat@@ ment .
worst of all , you could have infec@@ ted your entire family .
i understand why you wouldn 't let me kiss you .
how conven@@ ient for you .
you can work on my case .
i 'll be once again your little patient . i 'll be there with you .
every hour , every second ! - you have no right to say that !
even if the truth is pain@@ ful to hear . so there , goodbye !
are we e@@ aves@@ dropping , now ?
i 'm expecting a love letter .
- you 're at that age !
- see you .
well , well . a letter for olivier .

good morning , father .
i just received a letter that concer@@ ns you . really ?
you know what it might be about ? no , i can 't think of anything . you know , this american friend i wrote to ... ?
well , he agreed .
he would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish .
i can now confir@@ m your travel arrang@@ ements .
you will embar@@ k on the de grace , on the morning of dec@@ ember 16 .
- happy ? - you bet !
your mother and i are sad you won 't spend christmas with us .
but more important , we want you to be happy . you 'll see , mr. de@@ wil@@ de will make good company .
what does he do for a living ? he o@@ wns a few movie theat@@ ers in new york .
they call them nick@@ elo@@ de@@ ons .
ah yes , the penny cinema .
here 's one ... a letter from the sanat@@ orium .
i have a hun@@ ch i know what it 's about .
it 's what i thought .
well they 've got some ner@@ ve !
they 're claim@@ ing reim@@ bur@@ sement for a window pan@@ e i broke by accident .
medical services are already expen@@ sive . they should cover that .
i 'll call the director immediately .
hello , ma@@ demo@@ is@@ elle ?
get me number 16 at st - pierre - les
- bains , haute - loire .
mar@@ ceau des@@ rous@@ seau speaking .
i 'd like to speak to the director , please . thank you .
i beg you , mar@@ ceau , be diplomat@@ ic .
take the receiv@@ er .
and learn from the master .
hello ? mister director ?
yes :
no , not very well .
my parents just received a letter from your ac@@ coun@@ ting department .
it claim@@ s reim@@ bur@@ sement of a window pan@@ e i accident@@ ally broke .
it was a mistake ?
i 'm happy to hear it .
i will let you take care of it .
thank you , mister director .
give my best to madame .
goodbye . you had g@@ all .
yes , you went straight to the point !
from now on , i will have you deal directly with my credit@@ ors .
with pleasure , father .
monsieur is served .
you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau .
vo@@ ila .
tell me what you think .
" concer@@ ning the state of health of our son .
" in a sanat@@ orium close to paris .
" as soon as we can , we will in@@ form you of the ...
" address of this estab@@ l@@ ishment ,
" so that you may share with them our son 's medical records .
" yours truly ... " etc .
pretty good , right ? you 're out of your mind , mar@@ ceau .
you can 't do that .
charlotte said it would be suicide .
charlotte says that to keep me in the sanat@@ orium . as you can see , i 'm in good health .
that 's not true , mar@@ ceau . even yesterday i could hear you cou@@ gh@@ ing .
excuse me .
i must mail this at once .
stand up !
stand up ! compan@@ ions in mis@@ ery .
- what 's going on , olivier ?
- i want you to stay out of this . - you 'll be able to go back ...
- once you 're back to health .
- nothing could be more un@@ certain .
so i would pre@@ fer being over@@ se@@ as .
i would rather die at the cot@@ ton club instead of the as@@ y@@ lum .
you won 't say a word about it to my parents .
you promised .
yes , but i didn 't know just how serious this is .
not to say the number of people you can contamin@@ ate .
i will tell them everything . if you do , i 'll tell them of your ou@@ ting to m@@ ado .
they 'll send you to your grand@@ pa 's to become a black@@ smith 's apprent@@ ice .
you 're such a bastard .
i don 't give a damn ! - i don 't want you to die , you understand ?
- i think you just want me to stay here .
you wouldn 't have the balls .
just wait and see .
- who is it ? - it 's me , olivier .
come in .
something really serious .
well , what is it ?
it 's , hm ...
i 'm sorry i didn 't make it to the cir@@ cus on my birthday .
that 's it ?
you scared me . it was quickly forgotten , olivier .
i forgive you , of course .
you must get up early tomorrow . the holid@@ ays are over .
yes , aunt .
such a strange boy .
ah ! if he had mar@@ ceau 's education !
if mar@@ ceau had his state of health !
- so that 's it . you 're going to play me like a viol@@ in , now ?
really , you 're not spar@@ ing me anything .
you think i 'm going to roll over like a dog ? " don 't go , i 'll sp@@ ill the be@@ ans "
you 're totally wrong .
here , you forgot you ber@@ et .
you 'll be back within the hour .
you read too much " without family . "
you should refle@@ ct on the difference between liter@@ ature and reality .
- far@@ e@@ well , mar@@ ceau .
wake up , olivier . it 's time !
it 's 7 o '@@ clock .
but ...
olivier ?
- you haven 't seen him ? - no .
not this morning . yes .
he told me he had to leave to review his latin .
i helped him till past midnight .
he was probably in@@ tent on leaving without wak@@ ing me .
i came to tell you he 's ill .
a simple phone call would have suff@@ ic@@ ed .
i have fond memories of this place .
i didn 't want to miss the opportunity .
as for your cousin , i hope it 's nothing serious .
i was their family physic@@ ian in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
yes of course , mont@@ mar@@ tre .
hey ! guys !
they should count their forts .
we should have some enem@@ ies .
we were once at peace , but everybody got confused .
hey ! wait for me .
you 're not fighting anymore with the rif@@ fr@@ af@@ f of bachel@@ et st. ?
that 's ancient history !
let 's go , i 'm star@@ ved . see you ! see you cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re .
i 'm hungry too .
see you later ! see you , lo@@ ul@@ ou .
don 't you look d@@ apper in those god awful pants !
so long .
i need some gru@@ b too .
so long , r@@ iri .
bou@@ gr@@ as !
m '@@ sieur bou@@ gr@@ as !
- where to ? - i have no idea .
if you see him again , tell him ... he ran a pig@@ st@@ y in here .
it re@@ ek@@ ed as hell !
no problem , young man .
they 're in a rush and i 'm under the gun .
- jean is fine ?
- not so bad . - did he find work ?
- yes .
yes . and how is the baby ?
- leg of lam@@ b " so@@ is@@ sons . "
- coming up . - you were saying ?
- you 're baby , how 's he doing ? an apple pu@@ d@@ ding with leg of lam@@ b " so@@ is@@ sons . "
bon appe@@ tit .
the baby ?
he 's ador@@ able .
he 's with mrs. hac@@ que .
she 's baby@@ sitting . go see him !
will do , elo@@ die .
so long , elo@@ die .
g@@ laz@@ ier !
he 's a bit like your cousin .
isn 't he the cut@@ est ?
i often take care of him .
poor elo@@ die never stop@@ s .
and with jean without a steady job , and he likes to drink a bit .
in the end , you did well to leave .
- but i was forced to leave !
- well , you know what i mean .
you were such a ho@@ ol@@ igan !
your aunt and uncle ... do they treat you well ?
yes , madame hac@@ que .
in retro@@ sp@@ ect , your mother 's death ...
i wouldn 't say it was a lucky break , far from it , mo@@ thers are ir@@ re@@ pl@@ ace@@ able .
but for your future ...
often we say : a bles@@ sing in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
ah , here comes elo@@ die .
it 's me , my little tre@@ asure !
my love , it 's your mama .
i came to tell you i won 't be off work until 2 : 30@@ pm .
he 's a real cak@@ e@@ walk your little cher@@ ub .
you gave me a hell of a scar@@ e my little angel .
that 's too easy .
you 're a bastard , mar@@ ceau .
you think you can just die off like that ?
do whatever you like with your life ?
didn 't you think about the others ?
your parents ? jul@@ ienne ?
me ?
what will become of me if you ... if you die ? now , now .
don 't worry so much .
that 's enough .
you want me to say you 're right .
is that it ? i have given it some thought .
i decided i 'll talk to my parents .
you 're lying . hang on , my doub@@ ting thomas .
you want my pas@@ sport ?
they 're yours .
without them , i can 't go . it 's a trick .
you 'll only take them back !
what else do you need , then ?
- give it to me .
- it 's a trick !
i 'll show you a trick .
so , little out@@ cast ?
happy now ?
dear olivier ,
the lands@@ cape hasn 't changed much in the last 6 months .
bore@@ dom here has reached a new philosoph@@ ical dimension .
luc@@ kil@@ y , the pain from the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ thor@@ ax ke@@ eps me awake .
i 'm so ja@@ ded that seeing your face again would bring back my spir@@ its .
and so , if you can , please come .
the sanat@@ orium is near sau@@ gues . find a way to get sent away to live with your grand@@ pa .
i wait for you , my ol@@ ive , without fa@@ il . - mar@@ ceau
this morning , there@@ fore , the supervis@@ or found olivier 's scar@@ f in the yard .
yes , and what of it ?
it was found at the bottom of the gar@@ dener 's lad@@ der ... which was leaning against the school wall , ost@@ en@@ sibly in order to jump over to the other side .
fur@@ ther@@ more , in doing olivier 's bed , the chamber@@ ma@@ id found this .
i jud@@ ged it would be best to no@@ tif@@ y you before talking to olivier .
you don 't think that olivier ... mister director , i know him . i can 't imagine him doing such a thing .
and yet , the evidence is obvious . i 'd say a little too obvious .
do you believe , mister director , that a student jum@@ ping the wall would leave the lad@@ der behind ?
more@@ over his scar@@ f be@@ aring his name ?
or keeping such comprom@@ ising evidence in the dor@@ mit@@ ory ?
i would rather think he was the target of a pr@@ ank .
a very bad scho@@ ol@@ boy pr@@ ank . i think my husband is correct in his as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment , mister director .
our neph@@ ew knows what fate would a@@ wait him should he do such a thing .
we would send him off to his grand@@ parents , in auverg@@ ne .
you 're probably right .
i should have known better . if one of our students was bent on tar@@ n@@ ishing the image of your neph@@ ew , rest assu@@ red he will be pun@@ ished accor@@ d@@ ingly .
i will deal with this matter immediately .
what happened in 1685 ?
dele@@ pine ! the assassin@@ ation of henri iv by rav@@ ail@@ lac , monsieur .
he would have been migh@@ ty , this rav@@ ail@@ lac , to assassin@@ ate a king who had been dead for 75 years !
yes , sus@@ se !
1685 , re@@ voc@@ ation of the edi@@ ct of nantes by louis xiv , sir .
well done . now , what happened in ...
be se@@ ated , children .
i 'm here to discus@@ s a serious matter .
it would appear that one of you ... wanted to get chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f acc@@ used of jum@@ ping the wall .
his scar@@ f was left behind in the yard as evidence ... and other objec@@ ts i won 't mention at this time , were plant@@ ed in his personal belong@@ ings in the dor@@ mit@@ ory .
perhaps it was only meant as a stupid pr@@ ank . but i would sum@@ mon the guilty party to come forth in this instant , otherwise i will have to take me@@ as@@ ures against the entire class .
" a fault confes@@ sed is half re@@ dressed . " gentlem@@ en !
i 'm waiting .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , you would like to speak ?
nobody played a trick on me , sir .
i did jump the wall last night .
i don 't want the entire class pun@@ ished on my account .
- and where did you go ? - to see a friend .
the gir@@ lies !
- what do you mean : " the gir@@ lies " ?
- the stre@@ et@@ wal@@ kers , sir .
olivier !
shame on you ! you 're a dis@@ grace .
i don 't want you living with us anymore .
at least you don 't look like a ho@@ ol@@ igan !
come on , let 's go .
ho , victor !
can 't this wait ?
- she 's all yours , anton@@ in . - you 're holding us up .
adi@@ os !
give it to me .
you will call me " ton@@ ton . "
and that girl ... not a word about her to gr@@ anny .
all right , ton@@ ton .
you 'll see . there isn 't much here to lift gr@@ annie 's spir@@ its .
she 's not thril@@ led with your arri@@ val .
with grand@@ pa , it 's different .
he just loves telling stories .
so he 's happy that you 're coming .
besides , since in@@ jur@@ ing his leg , he 's been bo@@ red stif@@ f .
listen , i must te@@ ach you a phrase in " pat@@ ois , " and you will repe@@ at it to him .
oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue . say it .
oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue .
we don 't have much time for you to learn it .
we 're here . there 's the " ou@@ sta@@ ou . "
- go on , say the phrase .
- oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue .
" allo pit@@ ch@@ ou " !
let me look at you .
you have your father 's eyes . come on in !
i prepared a sn@@ ack for you .
you must be hungry after your trip .
here were are .
over here , it 's not like at victoria 's .
it will be a lot different than my daughter 's apartment .
there . you 'll see .
we can be quite comfortable here , too . sit over here .
we 'll get you something to eat . here .
this will be your pocket knife .
you must give a coin in return .
it 's the cu@@ st@@ om .
- will this do , ton@@ ton ?
it 's not for the money .
it 's to pre@@ serve friend@@ ship .
you 're grand@@ ma isn 't here .
she 's picking mus@@ h@@ rooms .
and a bit of water , of course !
well , then ?
- how is it , good ?
- victor , where are you ?
see that door , it 's your room .
you can put your things .
will you show him how to for@@ ge ?
yes , you can watch me smith iron .
and if you 're not too tired , you can give me a hand .
see you later , ton@@ ton .
i say , you look a bit pale to me .
don 't worry , here you 'll soon get back your color .
here comes gr@@ annie .
victor didn 't war@@ n you ? she 's a bit of a gro@@ uch .
she doesn 't like kissing very much .
give grand@@ ma a hug , olivier .
careful ! dum@@ my , you 'll make the mus@@ h@@ rooms tip over .
- we 're in for a treat tonight !
- no . you 'll have to wait until sunday .
so ?
are you the little s@@ camp my daughter went crazy over ?
anyway , he 's a good boy .
and very pol@@ ite if you can believe it .
we 'll see .
he 's one of the best black@@ s@@ mi@@ ths in the country .
okay , grand@@ pa .
ah .
there you are .
- this one ?
- yes , it will st@@ ir the fire .
in 2 months , you 'll have man 's muscles !
you can stop now , olivier .
you should tour the stable and say hi to the co@@ ws .
you 'll find 3 . they 're kind .
there 's do@@ ur@@ ade , the most assu@@ red .
then , la mar@@ cade , and finally , pou@@ mer@@ ade , the one with the spo@@ ts . - where is the stable ?
- in the back .
you can go .
hello co@@ ws !
how are you ?
and you , la mar@@ cade . and you are la do@@ ur@@ ade .
how are you , pou@@ mer@@ ade ?
let me introdu@@ ce myself .
normally i live in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
what are you doing here ?
get out of here , you hear me ?
he knows what to expect , now . if that ban@@ dit ever comes near the farm again .
what is the sense of ad@@ ding mis@@ ery to mis@@ ery ?
come on , now . he provo@@ ked me , right ? i didn 't start anything .
- we must understand him . - understand him !
if you can understand a criminal , you can understand me as well .
if he ever comes close to the l@@ ad he knows what to expect .
i thought your god was the god of for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess .
leave my god alone ! i 'm taking the animals to the fields .
make sure the boy doesn 't leave the farm un@@ ac@@ compan@@ ied .
why not ? he 's not in prison , here .
you read what victoria wrote in her letter :
you must never leave that little sco@@ und@@ rel out of your sight !
you 'd think victoria makes the rules in my home !
could you please call " pit@@ ch@@ ou " ?
olivier ! go see your grand@@ father .
right , read me that article .
" the nazi party stat@@ ed that the german@@ s have ral@@ lied in great numbers ...
" by adolf hitler to burn all books de@@ em@@ ed sub@@ ver@@ sive ...
" and dec@@ ad@@ ent in the public square .
" several million books were reduc@@ ed to ash@@ es on the morning of may 5 . "
you see , olivier , when the world 's train leaves its tracks , no one knows where it will stop .
why would anyone want to burn books ?
they bring no harm . they don 't want people to think ! they 're being gro@@ omed to be like machines .
but tell me , you read very well , how can you be doing so po@@ or@@ ly in class , at least according to your aunt victoria ?
- i don 't know , grand@@ pa . - you don 't know ...
fur@@ ther@@ more , it seems you sne@@ ak out of the college at night . you 're a real es@@ coul@@ as !
in our family we always had rebel@@ s .
look at me : i 'm the only red in this country of wh@@ ites !
say , grand@@ pa ?
yes ?
the sanat@@ orium where mar@@ ceau is staying , it 's in this region , right ?
i say , you go straight to the point .
you 've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanat@@ orium .
tell me , did you come here to see mar@@ ceau ?
- yes , grand@@ pa . - it 's good to tell the truth . but ...
victoria was very clear that under no circum@@ stance ... you were to go to the sanat@@ orium .
but why would she object ?
she must have her reasons . you see , we 're al@@ ike .
you think so ?
and why is that ?
because i want to see mar@@ ceau too ! i really miss my grand@@ son .
he grew up here .
always running after girls in the hills , and f@@ ishing for tr@@ out or cr@@ ay@@ fish .
we had some great times , him and me .
but now , it only hur@@ ts to know he 's there .
the doctor told me i couldn 't go , that i could catch his ill@@ ness .
but mark my words :
we 're going to see him together ! - really ? - as real as i am an es@@ coul@@ as .
i looked at the map , it 's about 50 km .
we 're not going to take the road .
the mountain tra@@ ils will save us at least 10 km .
we 'll take a horse and bug@@ gy , and i 'll tell them i 'm taking you to the animal fair in lan@@ ge@@ ac .
will they let us go ?
they 'll say i 'm crazy . but i 'm head of this family . - i can do what i want , right ?
- yes , grand@@ pa ! hold on .
don 't get your spir@@ its too high .
i need to know if you can keep a secret .
with victor and gr@@ annie , you have to act a bit , show them you 're not really thril@@ led about coming with me .
- right . - good .
we shouldn 't aro@@ use their sus@@ pic@@ ions .
we 'll leave sunday at dawn .
but until then ...
that means we won 't arrive before night@@ fall . they 'll figure out we didn 't go to lan@@ ge@@ ac .
so what ?
once i 've seen mar@@ ceau , they can think what they want .
i don 't care .
at least we 're lucky , the weather 's on our side .
hope@@ fully we won 't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass .
let 's go , n@@ ono . let 's go !
that 's it , grand@@ pa !
- i gave him some o@@ ats . - that 's good .
- here .
let 's have a little fe@@ ast !
some ham , bread and wine .
that 's my holy trin@@ ity .
you see , whatever victoria might think ,
i wouldn 't trade a single tree from these mountains ... for all the lights in paris .
say , grand@@ pa ? why doesn 't gr@@ annie like being kissed ? you must understand her .
she lost 2 children .
that made her a little col@@ der .
if you had known her when she was in her 20@@ s , she was beautiful . a real ey@@ e-@@ po@@ pper .
you know , for our marriage , we under@@ took the white stick cerem@@ ony .
the white stick cerem@@ ony ?
what 's that ? if the fi@@ an@@ cee placed a bro@@ om on its fli@@ p-@@ side against her door , it meant she didn 't want you .
- that is so funny .
- you think so ? damn it ! i didn 't sleep all night .
but the next morning , gr@@ annie had turned all the bro@@ oms on the farm on the right side .
and even the fil@@ thy ones .
if only she could hear me !
at the time , she just loved cl@@ inging to my arm as we dan@@ ced .
what are you w@@ ishing for , young moun@@ tain@@ eer ? what did you hope to acqu@@ ire if you are un@@ willing to dance ?
que vol@@ io cerca , jo@@ vo de la montag@@ na ?
que vol@@ io cerca , si vol@@ io pas dan@@ ser ? if you didn 't want to dance , you should not have come .
a@@ ie ! grand@@ pa !
- i trip@@ ped , olivier .
- come , come . come , it 's nothing .
it 's nothing .
just give me a hand .
serv@@ es me right for playing the young man .
there .
i 'm breathing better and i 'll be alright .
we still have ... 2 km u@@ ph@@ ill .
the road will be easier after that .
and what if it 's m '@@ sieur pri@@ vat ?
we 'll say hi anyway .
- but he tried to kill my parents !
- so what ? you don 't fire a gun at people without a reason .
have you ever asked yourself why he did that ?
grand@@ pa ! it 's uncle victor .
that 's a different matter .
- you think i don 't see through this ?
you 'll never get to the sanat@@ orium before night@@ fall .
it 's mad@@ ness . what do you mean ?
is it mad@@ ness to want to see my grand@@ son ?
- you 're the one that 's crazy !
- i might be crazy ... but you 're turning around and i come with you .
and you , olivier , don 't try that again or i 'll b@@ ust your ass .
and not a word to your grand@@ ma , she 'll gou@@ ge your eyes out .
i bought a 6 lb ham at fay@@ et 's .
let 's go .
you see , the word sol@@ itude , it only takes one " l " .
because it 's all alone , you see !
you didn 't con@@ jug@@ ate correc@@ tly the past tense of the ver@@ b " shoot . "
tell me why ! because it 's an exception . it 's an ir@@ regular ver@@ b .
then why couldn 't you get that right ? i forgot .
on top of that you mis@@ sp@@ el@@ led the proper name of the ban@@ dit .
if you work hard , you 'll soon become an ace .
but ... when you go back to school , you 'll have to go back to paris .
- but , grand@@ pa ... - it 's sad to say , but no@@ wad@@ ays , the future of youth lies within the cities .
it break@@ s my heart to say it because , as you know , i would love it if you could stay here with me .
i would love to stay here with you too . don 't be silly !
after a few months , you 'd get bo@@ red .
no . i 'm happy , here .
i 'm happy like ... - like ...
- like with your mother ?
so much the better .
you should join your gr@@ annie out in the fields .
today , she 's at devil 's ab@@ y@@ ss .
you know where that is ?
what will gr@@ annie say ? you 'll soon find out .
don 't forget to gre@@ et the fol@@ ks you en@@ counter .
here people talk to each other .
" par@@ le@@ z-@@ moi d '@@ amour
" re@@ dit@@ es-@@ moi des choses ten@@ dres
" vo@@ tre beau discours ... " mon co@@ eur n '@@ est pas las de l '@@ ent@@ endre
besides , you wanted to kill my parents !
you said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you !
but you fired a gun at them .
that 's why you went to ja@@ il !
it 's your aunt who told you that ?
let me tell you what happened .
i don 't want to hear it .
leave me alone !
what are you up to , olivier ?
you came directly ?
no , i swear it , gr@@ annie .
- did you meet anyone on the way ? - no .
actually , yes . i saw lou@@ ison flan@@ din .
he asked me to go to a soccer game with him .
- i told him i was coming to see you .
- very well , then .
good . well , i 'm off to see the co@@ ws .
what are you doing ?
you can tell you 're from paris !
co@@ ws don 't care for sugar . they like salt !
give the sugar to the dog .
it 's not good for his eyes , but over here , we don 't let anything go to waste .
here , dog@@ gy , come boy .
good , huh ? that 's good .
how can you tell when it 's time to go back to the farm , then ?
look at the shadow cast by the shed .
when it re@@ aches the boul@@ der , it 's time to bring the co@@ ws home .
looks like you have a heat stroke . go fresh@@ en up at the river .
- the river looks pretty deep .
- " devil 's ab@@ y@@ ss " ?
- a long time ago , there was a man who brag@@ ged about not belie@@ ving in either god or devil .
well , the poor bastard got his pun@@ ishment .
the river swallowed him .
- really ? - obviously ! he made a point to come and work here on the lord 's day .
one stor@@ my day , as he was driving his car@@ t along the banks , he surely came too close to the preci@@ p@@ ice .
then the two hands of the devil lung@@ ed from the river , his long cla@@ ws gras@@ ped him fier@@ cel@@ y so he couldn 't move , and down he went to the bottom with his two horses !
- that 's not true . it 's a legend . - you 're like your grand@@ father .
climb up on the rock ... and bend over the preci@@ p@@ ice .
you 'll see the re@@ mains of the car@@ t at the bottom !
- see it ?
- not sure .
the water isn 't clear .
look again !
ah yes ! i see it .
i see the car@@ t with bones and a skel@@ eton !
did you notice , gr@@ annie ?
the shadow has set on the boul@@ der .
well done , you 're a fast lear@@ ner .
soon , you 'll be able to lead the co@@ ws to the past@@ ure all by yourself .
if you like . here .
take my stick and lead them toward the trail .
go on ! we 'll see how well you do .
come on co@@ ws ! let 's go .
where are you going , pou@@ mer@@ ade ?
it 's pretty obvious you pe@@ aled chun@@ ks off her ho@@ of .
i 'm not s@@ elling her to you . ( speaking pat@@ ois )
pat@@ ois with a paris@@ ian accent . very com@@ ical .
he 's making progress in this area too !
- olivier ! it 's great that you can now smith , but you can 't ne@@ gle@@ ct your studies .
wait !
we 're not done yet .
an automobile !
she did well for herself , our victoria .
that 's for sure .
she went to paris and paris went to her head .
she 's as@@ ham@@ ed of us .
she avo@@ ids telling her friends that we are black@@ s@@ mi@@ ths . instead , she says we 're iron@@ work artist@@ s .
i think being a black@@ smith is a more noble trade .
you plan to stay with us ?
no , no . i came in like the wind , just to drop off jul@@ ienne .
i thought you dropped in to say hi .
that too , of course .
my god ; this heat ! tell me ,
mar@@ ceau , my grand@@ son .
how 's he doing ?
his condition is stable the doc@@ tors tell me .
but they may have to per@@ form a thor@@ aco .
- a thor@@ aco@@ plast@@ y .
it 's an operation consist@@ ing of com@@ pressing the dis@@ eas@@ ed lung by re@@ moving some ri@@ bs .
- in his case , 6 .
- that 's terrible !
- are you going back ? - no .
he 's asked us to leave .
one-@@ eyed bitch !
i would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health .
children should not have to suff@@ er . and how is your leg doing ?
a bit of pain , that 's all .
the real bur@@ den is in@@ action . lucky for me , i have olivier .
- he seems well ac@@ clim@@ at@@ ised . - yes .
he 's very happy , here .
but you must take him back to paris .
oh no .
that 's out of the question !
victoria !
i am your father . this is my home . i 'm in charge .
and you 'll listen to me , for god 's sake !
i worked with him almost every day .
he 's a very bright boy .
he 's in@@ quis@@ itive , devo@@ urs books .
with a bit of help , he 'll become someone .
he must be allowed to further his studies .
you have no right to con@@ dem@@ n him to ignor@@ ance .
sometimes i wonder if perhaps i wasn 't too hard on him .
well , speak of the devil . - good day , aunt .
- i am happy to see you again .
- lik@@ e@@ wise , aunt .
your grand@@ father tells me you like it here .
yes , aunt .
you know what would make him happy ?
- going up to see mar@@ ceau .
- that won 't happen .
it 's true ! show her the letter .
your aunt was clear : he doesn 't want to see anyone .
he 's was cruel toward me , this morning .
- i 'm sure he 'll want to see me .
- listen ,
victoria , it would do mar@@ ceau a lot of good !
well .
if you 're ready in 5 minutes , i 'll drop you off at the sanat@@ orium .
there is an evening coach .
- thank you , aunt . - remember : 5 minutes ! - i 'll be ready .
- hey !
olivier , before you go , drink a bit of wine and che@@ w on some gar@@ li@@ c .
it will give you strength .
and rep@@ el evil .
guillaume , please ! stop the car at the next cur@@ ve .
mar@@ ceau is lost , olivier .
the doc@@ tors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope .
you must not tell anyone . do you understand ?
- i swear , aunt . ah !
my god .
it 's not fair !
he suff@@ ers immen@@ sely .
you 'll see , he 's changed .
but he must@@ n 't find out .
anyway , who knows .
perhaps there is still a chance .
i 'm sure of it , my aunt .
i 'm sure of it .
i don 't have the courage .
he 's inside that building .
room 18 . second floor .
you 'll have to sne@@ ak in , children are not allowed .
don 't worry .
thank you , aunt .
i know you . you 're his cousin .
you can 't stay here . he 's not in his room .
he 's outside , in the sol@@ arium .
- go on !
- thanks .
- it 's you , my little out@@ cast .
i knew you would come .
- how did you get here ? - your mother brought me .
you see , the divine isn 't that bad .
have a seat .
by the way , bravo for the st@@ unt you pulled at the college .
your letter cracked me up . a work of art !
how are you feeling ?
i hope you didn 't come for a medical report .
it bo@@ ils down to one word : ir@@ reco@@ ver@@ able .
that 's not true .
after your operation , things will im@@ prove .
that 's right ...
hope that everything will go well after losing half your ri@@ bs !
i must admit , i 'm a little pes@@ sim@@ ist@@ ic .
you see , olivier .
i would have prefer@@ red dying in new york .
or on the bridge of a tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic .
much better than here , don 't you think ?
olivier , i beg you .
you remember ... ?
the concert by louis armstrong ?
we share so many memories you and i .
we do indeed !
grand@@ pa em@@ brac@@ es you warm@@ ly .
tell him i 'm doing well .
how is he ?
his leg still hur@@ ts .
you know , we almost succe@@ eded to come see you .
- we were forced to turn back , though .
- dar@@ n es@@ coul@@ as , hasn 't changed a bit .
well , here comes my guardian angel .
as you can see , i have nothing to compl@@ ain about .
i was ru@@ de with jul@@ ienne this morning .
i would like you to watch over her . exten@@ d her the love i was incap@@ able of giving her .
okay ? - do you promise ?
- i promise , mar@@ ceau .
alright , time to go .
and please ...
- don 't come back to see me .
- why ? - please .
- you can 't stay , olivier .
i told you already .
children are not allowed .
don 't be angry with him .
you 'll see , you 'll like it up here .
this is the best mat@@ t@@ ress ever .
so put your mind at rest .
have you seen these old books ?
" le tour de la france by two children . "
- of course it 's good . with that i learned to read to my wife .
- may i open it ?
look at this beautiful med@@ al .
it was your father 's . with palms .
and what 's this ?
belong@@ s to my daughter .
- aunt victoria ?
- yes .
long ago , with only an orange , you could celebr@@ ate christmas eve .
oh yes ! back then , we didn 't have the lux@@ ury of going ... to the hospital in a car@@ riage .
life was really har@@ sh ... and money was hard to come by . we would fight over it .
have you seen this funny boot ?
all blo@@ ated and with an enor@@ mous sol@@ e .
that sho@@ e belong@@ ed to your dad .
you see , we send boys to their death before they can experience life .
your poor father .
when he came back to this country , after he was in@@ ju@@ red ,
i didn 't recognize him . all i could say was : " there you are . "
he we@@ pt .
he walked between two cr@@ ut@@ ches , still bor@@ e shr@@ ap@@ nel in his skin ,
his lungs bur@@ nt by the gas .
to think he was once as swift as a squir@@ rel , only to stag@@ ger into a cloud .
he would raise his eyes , as if to prepare an answer , but he said nothing .
your mother re@@ sto@@ red his taste for life .
just enough time to make a little darling .
and now he 's gone .
i can 't sleep .
mar@@ ceau is always on my mind .
it is so un@@ fair .
we were planning on getting married .
i would do anything for him to be cu@@ red .
don 't worry .
soon , he 'll be well again .
he told me that even if he was to reco@@ ver , he would no longer marry me .
he said that only because he doesn 't want to leave you with any reg@@ re@@ ts . - you think so ?
- i 'm sure .
this ill@@ ness has really changed him .
besides , there 's this other girl , the nurse .
don 't cry , jul@@ ienne . don 't .
you know , he doesn 't really care about charlotte .
- i don 't know .
i don 't know anymore . - it 's true !
he told me .
don 't worry .
kiss me , olivier .
not like that , you idiot .
mar@@ ceau !
- not really , no .
i think i 'll go back to paris .
i thought you were going to stay here a few days .
i 'm too close to mar@@ ceau , here .
victor ?
would you mind taking me to the station ?
i 'm really busy with work , you know . olivier could take you .
he can ste@@ er a bug@@ gy .
you must not lo@@ iter on the way .
you will come home right after .
- you know , i can go by myself . - no .
a young girl should never travel alone .
he 's right .
by the way , the other day in lan@@ ge@@ ac , i saw a used wi@@ re@@ less .
- for a good price . - no music in my house !
why not ?
- a bit of music , here and there .
- no , no .
nov@@ el@@ ties are bear@@ ers of mis@@ fortune .
it seems you like to d@@ well in it .
you don 't want water spr@@ inging from a p@@ ipe , so you carry a bu@@ cket .
you don 't want music that could up@@ lift our spir@@ its .
you can 't live in the past or among the dead forever , mother .
i can live with mine , thank you .
line 24 , arri@@ ving from pu@@ y-@@ en-@@ vel@@ ay , en route to paris via cler@@ mont-@@ ferr@@ and , immedi@@ ate depar@@ ture , platform 1 .
it was sweet of you to ac@@ company me , olivier .
we 'll meet again in paris , some day ?
victor was right , it 's a p@@ ity you are leaving .
- we were happy together .
- you 're a swe@@ eti@@ e . - mar@@ ceau asked me to watch over you .
- and you 've succe@@ eded nic@@ ely .
are you crazy , you little per@@ vert !
- what 's the matter ? the other night ... - quiet !
war@@ m-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , just like your mother .
- you have no right to say that !
- oh yeah ?
how do you call a woman who had lo@@ vers ?
none of your business .
she did as she pleased .
victoria said your mother was a smal@@ l-@@ time god@@ dess .
it 's not her fault if pri@@ vat tried to shoot her .
not her fault ? well there 's a good one !
why do you say that ?
my poor olivier !
if you only knew what your mother did to pri@@ vat .
what did she do to him ?
- tell me , jul@@ ienne ! - i can 't tell you .
attention , now depar@@ ting .
go and see pri@@ vat .
he lives on a big estate called les br@@ uy@@ eres .
he 'll tell you what really happened .
we 'll meet again .
later .
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
come on , faster !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
hue , n@@ ono !
easy , easy , n@@ ono .
w@@ hoa !
i 'd like to speak to mr. pri@@ vat .
it 's very important . yes , i see .
he shouldn 't be long .
you can wait in the living room .
follow me .
it 's your mother , olivier .
a friend of mine made that b@@ ust .
she was about to turn 18 .
i thought you wouldn 't want to see me again .
i didn 't come for you .
i need to know something .
- it 's very important .
- i 'm listening .
why did you want to kill my parents .
what did they do to you ?
i was your ... your mother 's first husband . my mother 's first husband ?
your mother couldn 't bring herself to tell you she was divor@@ ced . she didn 't want you trou@@ bled by that .
we got married before the war .
we were living together and then i was called to the front .
at the same time your father was .
we were chil@@ d@@ hood friends , all three of us .
when he got in@@ ju@@ red , in octo@@ ber of 1914 , and was released from duty , your mother took care of him .
i thought they met when father came back wo@@ unded from the war ? no . no .
but your mother was indeed his nurse .
months and years went by .
then one day , i received a dis@@ hear@@ tening letter ... from your mother . she was leaving for paris , with your father .
- it 's not true .
you 're lying ! - no .
you 'll be the only one to know the truth .
a truth i have never reve@@ aled . to anyone .
upon reading the letter , i was shat@@ tered , for@@ lor@@ n .
i wanted to find your mother .
in the spring of 1917 , during general niv@@ ell 's offen@@ sives ,
i had volun@@ te@@ ered to per@@ form inspec@@ tions on a fort we had re@@ taken .
i picked up a gren@@ ade , un@@ pin@@ ned it , then i pushed my arm through a gun sli@@ t ,
and held it until my arm blew off .
that 's how i became a war hero .
weeks later , i left the hospital and headed for paris .
with the in@@ tent of killing your parents , and turning the gun on myself . there it is .
olivier !
- i hope you 'll forgive me .
- my parents would never have done that !
it 's not their fault , olivier . it 's the war that created this mess .
this can 't be true .
i will never forgive them !
they 're no longer my mother nor my father !
you have no right to judge them !
you 'll understand this later on .
it is possible to love ... and then no longer love .
we 're not masters ...
- shut up !
olivier !
move on , n@@ ono ! move on !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
olivier ! charlotte ?
what 's going on ? it 's mar@@ ceau ?
mar@@ ceau ?
no . don 't worry .
he 's over there , in the car .
how is he ?
they wouldn 't let him go out , but he persu@@ aded the director . he wanted to see you .
they will oper@@ ate tomorrow .
you 'll see .
he 's weak@@ ened , but ke@@ eps in good spir@@ its .
so , my little out@@ cast ? - you 're now a she@@ pher@@ d ?
- you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau .
you should be resting !
but i am resting , here .
don 't say anything to your grand@@ pa ?
let him cher@@ ish the image of a young man in perfect health , rather than one of deter@@ ior@@ ation .
besides , i came for you .
i got your letter .
i needed to talk to you ..
- you didn 't have to come . - i know that .
i wanted to ask you something .
what is it ?
you must forgive your parents , olivier .
do not judge them , as i often did with mine .
since i 've been living with death , i find these jud@@ g@@ ments so lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us .
your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them ? no .
- but look at what they did to mr. pri@@ vat !
- it 's all the same .
the love they had for each other ... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same med@@ al .
you can@@ not split them apart .
do you understand ?
remember , olivier .
one day , you said that my life and death wouldn 't have meaning just for me .
so now , i want you to trust me .
it 's the last time ...
you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau !
we 'll see each other after the operation !
don 't be silly .
do what i say .
promised ?
i know you 're going back to school in paris .
but before you go , i want you to visit your parents ' grave .
and tell them that you love them .
how can i tell them ?
if you put your heart into it , they 'll hear you .
really ?
yes .
i have a book on the language of flowers .
i 'll offer them a rose .
a red rose .
it 's a symbol of love .
crazy love .
bravo .
you see , when you want to .
now , now .
don 't start that again .
we 'll see each other again !
we 'll travel to america .
we 'll go che@@ er louis armstrong at the cot@@ ton club .
we 'll have a great time !
- what do you say , my ol@@ ive ?
- let 's do it !
courage , my little ur@@ chin !
you old far@@ t !
i 'm the editor of " l '@@ illu@@ stration . "
i 'm here for od@@ il@@ on hubert , the alger@@ ian mp .
he 's over there .
thank you .
mr. hubert ?
i 'm camille br@@ uy@@ ere .
as the first man to re@@ present fren@@ ch@@ men in alger@@ ia , my new@@ sp@@ aper would like to devo@@ te an article to you .
- about alger@@ ia ?
- no , about you .
about me ?
a shakespe@@ are@@ an trag@@ edy with blood and violence ?
our read@@ ers love that , sir .
is that so ?
it 's another country , young man . another world . a land of extre@@ mes .
scal@@ ding days , fre@@ ez@@ ing nights . the chok@@ ing smell of go@@ at and jas@@ mine .
let me take notes .
it 's about other religi@@ ons and pe@@ op@@ les .
it 's about arab@@ s , fan@@ at@@ ical mus@@ lim warriors who only love horses and arms .
that 's great .
how will you explain to your read@@ ers the new race of french sett@@ lers , the truly ex@@ otic mix of cor@@ sic@@ ans , people from the ro@@ uer@@ gue , the ar@@ ie@@ ge , the span@@ i@@ ards , je@@ ws and mal@@ t@@ ese ?
let 's give it a try and start at the beginning .
when did you get to alger@@ ia ?
i arrived in oran in 1837 with my friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
i was a medical officer and he was an interpre@@ ter .
alger@@ ia was a world filled with wild dreams .
everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this new@@ ly con@@ quer@@ ed land .
we 'd been fighting for 7 years .
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 1 .
the emir 's doctor
he 's the guy on the black stal@@ lion .
and i , jean-baptiste fre@@ mond , will get abd el-@@ kader !
the colonel wanted you to see the interior of alger@@ ia .
you 'll have your fill .
wait for my signal to shoot .
i 've been in the field for 3 years and i haven 't killed a single ar@@ ab yet !
if you shoot , you 'll get court marti@@ aled !
crap !
shit !
the sly old dog !
curse your mother 's religion !
let him die , doc !
take care of our wo@@ unded .
- he 's a man like you and me .
- maybe like you , not me .
you 're nai@@ ve .
you won 't live long if you keep this up .
hey interpre@@ ter , ask this guy where they spent the night .
who gave them food and shel@@ ter ?
tell him i 'll shoot him in the head if he lies .
- tem@@ ou@@ chent . - shit !
- let 's go .
- what about him ?
bring him .
i 'll show him what i 'm made of .
bre@@ te@@ uil !
dum@@ as !
shit !
sav@@ ages !
burn that damn village !
set the whole town ab@@ laz@@ e !
cut down the trees !
burn their cro@@ ps !
those br@@ utes must die !
- take them all !
- even the women ?
i said " them all , " lieutenant !
women and children too ! - why the women ?
- arab@@ s buy and sell women like cat@@ tle .
the ugly ones become slav@@ es .
they invent@@ ed raz@@ z@@ ias , lieutenant , not us .
the only thing arab@@ s respect is strength .
that 's the only thing those fan@@ at@@ ics understand .
strength .
imagine our desp@@ air .
hel@@ ie and i were saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans .
we hadn 't come to alger@@ ia for this , but to unite the east and the west like we 'd s@@ worn to do a few months earlier in paris .
you are now brothers through saint-@@ simon . apost@@ les of a new christian@@ ity .
we saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans , who follow the te@@ ach@@ ings of our master , the late count of saint-@@ simon , a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le econom@@ ist and philosoph@@ er , want to build a new society based on progress .
engine@@ ers , poly@@ techn@@ ici@@ ans and bank@@ ers , we 'll spread our message around the world .
let 's leave for africa , for the regen@@ cy of al@@ gi@@ ers over which the french flag now f@@ lies .
let 's all swear to unite the east 's spiritu@@ al val@@ ues with the material ones of the west .
we swear !
we swear !
hello , ferdinand .
mother , you know ferdinand de les@@ se@@ ps .
mr. de les@@ se@@ ps .
he 's going to eg@@ y@@ pt with father enf@@ antin to build a canal lin@@ king the mediterran@@ ean to the red sea .
a canal ?
what ever for ?
so indi@@ a-@@ bound bo@@ ats won 't need to go around africa .
those are the per@@ eire brothers , very rich bank@@ ers .
mother , this is my friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
we 're going to alger@@ ia together .
he 's an interpre@@ ter and i 'll act as medical officer in oran .
we 'll build a new world over there , mad@@ am .
all men will be equ@@ al , reg@@ ard@@ less of race or religion .
on the barbar@@ y coast ! my god !
have a seat , mother .
excuse me .
- i don 't know that friend . - he 's a new one .
allow me to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you , mrs. hubert .
your son od@@ il@@ on is a good boy and a ze@@ alous apost@@ le of our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian cause .
- i fear for him , sir .
- why is that ?
you 're sending him to alger@@ ia , a war@@ - and chol@@ er@@ a-@@ rid@@ den land .
of course .
but it 's an excit@@ ing mission :
to wake up slum@@ ber@@ ing islam and cre@@ ate a new society .
my only son with arab@@ s !
- we 're to meet the colonel .
- he 's busy at the moment .
- we 'll wait here .
- as you wish .
did you know colonel lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere was saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian too ?
i 'm not surprised .
he went to the poly@@ technique , so he must be in favor of progress .
- goodbye , mr. ben@@ simon . - goodbye .
interpre@@ ter hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
medical officer , major od@@ il@@ on hubert .
at ease .
i know .
father enf@@ antin told me about your coming to alger@@ ia .
welcome to this beautiful country where much re@@ mains to be done .
follow me .
i 'll brief you .
we 're occup@@ ying the ports of al@@ gi@@ ers , bone and oran .
our only intention , at first , was to occup@@ y the co@@ ast@@ line , like the tur@@ ks .
that isn 't what we saw when we arrived , colonel .
this is clearly a war to conqu@@ er and ex@@ termin@@ ate the arab@@ s .
i know .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers wrote that we 're more barbar@@ ian than the barbar@@ ians .
they 're unfortunately right .
but whose fault is it ?
abd el-@@ kader has started a holy war against us .
he s@@ wore to throw us into the sea .
he 's wag@@ ed a v@@ ast , cruel and ru@@ th@@ less war against us .
we did inv@@ ade his land .
we 're de@@ aling with religi@@ ons fan@@ at@@ ics ! we have to domin@@ ate them , or they 'll drive us out and the british will take our place .
the french government doesn 't know what it wants .
ten gover@@ nor@@ -@@ gener@@ als in 6 years !
we don 't have enough men to end this once and for all .
barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million arab@@ s in a country 3 times the size of france .
it 's ridiculous !
yet , the saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian mission is clear :
we want to help the arab@@ s , to protect their language and their religion . we wish to let them run their own country and help them gradu@@ ally take in the val@@ ues of modern western civiliz@@ ation .
excuse me , colonel ...
how is that different from colon@@ iz@@ ation ?
the land , to@@ us@@ saint .
the land .
we need to leave it to the arab@@ s who are its righ@@ t@@ ful far@@ mers .
our role is to build fac@@ tor@@ ies , roads and rail@@ roads .
that 's why i created the first ar@@ ab offic@@ es in this land and why i set up the first z@@ ou@@ ave regiment , made up of mus@@ lim volun@@ te@@ ers who are now our brothers in arms .
i would like to volun@@ te@@ er in such a regiment .
not now .
i have more important work for you .
bu@@ ge@@ aud will be in oran next week . his mission is to se@@ ek peace with abd el-@@ kader .
you speak arab@@ ic , to@@ us@@ saint ?
i can pass for egyp@@ tian .
very well .
you 'll remain in@@ cogn@@ ito in the nat@@ ive city .
there , you 'll contact abd el-@@ kader 's man .
you want me to sp@@ y on the arab@@ s ?
no , we 're doing it for peace , for a good cause .
as for you , hubert , you 'll handle the chol@@ era epi@@ demi@@ c , which has hit our tro@@ ops very hard .
- and the population even harder .
- i know . hubert will treat everyone equ@@ ally .
be careful , doctor .
the other doc@@ tors before you all died of chol@@ era .
- what about you , sister ?
- god is watching over me .
le@@ ila ?
this is le@@ ila , one of our orph@@ ans .
- she spe@@ aks arab@@ ic and french .
- hello , miss .
hello , doctor .
he 's de@@ hydr@@ ated .
tell him to drink a lot . bo@@ iled water .
no need to be so formal with me .
i can te@@ ach you arab@@ ic .
he needs a new band@@ age .
i will be chap@@ er@@ on@@ ing your les@@ sons with le@@ ila .
why , sister ?
don 't you trust me ?
i need to learn arab@@ ic too .
your con@@ vent 's been here over 200 years - and you don 't speak arab@@ ic ?
- i need the theory .
cover him up .
he 's in a sorry state .
i 'm dis@@ cour@@ aged , doctor . they keep dying .
i pr@@ ay every day , but ...
medicine is making progress .
we now know it sp@@ read@@ s through water .
we 'll find a cure .
try tur@@ pent@@ ine .
your protege is great !
when the poor girl was little , arab@@ s killed her parents before her eyes .
her family 's from sp@@ ain .
but she looks and spe@@ aks arab@@ ic .
her grandmother was a " mam@@ ma rosa . "
a long time ago , a boat with 10 of our span@@ ish sisters ran ag@@ round here .
our sisters were all sol@@ d as slav@@ es to kab@@ yle and tur@@ kis@@ h chie@@ fs .
the mother superior was named maria rosa , so the off@@ spring of those forced mar@@ ri@@ ages were named " mam@@ ma rosas . "
you shouldn 't laugh .
- forgive me , sister .
- we raised le@@ ila as one of our own .
tell him children have to drink a lot .
- he said , " may allah bl@@ ess you . "
- get a stret@@ cher .
hurry !
want a woman ?
you had that one yesterday .
she 's no longer a virgin .
let me in . let me in !
- what 're you doing here ?
- you 'll blow my cover .
everyone knows who you are .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in bro@@ th@@ els and have forgotten your mission .
that 's not true .
the colonel told me to bl@@ end in , so i am .
you 've no idea what de@@ lights the east has to offer .
everything is here to please men .
these women have been raised to ful@@ fill our every desire .
od@@ il@@ on , i 'm unit@@ ing with the east on a daily basis .
- want to try ?
- have you lost your mind ?
you 'll come around .
this isn 't quite the spiritu@@ al union our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian brothers had in mind .
the colonel sent me .
he hasn 't heard from you in over a month .
you risk getting court marti@@ aled .
i found a way to contact abd el-@@ kader .
trust me .
stay .
special tr@@ icks , huh ?
i know who you are .
so do i .
why are you sp@@ ying on us ?
i 'm not sp@@ ying .
i 'm bringing peace .
we also se@@ ek peace .
but peace is worth nothing without freedom .
france is willing to respect your freedom . - if you stop the war . - it 's not up to me .
- tell your leader .
- only allah has the power - to decide
- i know .
allah has a lot of respon@@ sibil@@ ities .
- i 'm sure he could use our help .
- i 'll do my best .
- tell me about bahia .
- she 's beautiful .
- i know .
i saw her .
- she 's nice .
- haven 't you had enough women ?
- she 's different .
i 'm bahia .
my father , si kad@@ d@@ our , sent me to tell you emir abd el-@@ kader , the leader of the holy war , is ready to bro@@ ker peace .
thank you .
you 've brought me great news .
you speak french well .
my father didn 't have a son , so he taught me to read and write like a boy .
i have to go .
that means " i love you . "
- excuse me ?
- right .
- it could be use@@ ful .
yes .
but more sensu@@ ous .
yes , again .
hello , everyone !
i have great news !
- any new develop@@ ments ?
- i 'm in love .
crazy in love !
what do you think ?
it 's not what you think , od@@ il@@ on .
this is serious .
she 's from a big tent . - excuse me ?
- from a noble family .
she 's beautiful , smart ...
- who is she ?
- si kad@@ d@@ our 's daughter .
- bahia ?
- you know her ?
very well .
we studied together .
that 's fantast@@ ic , le@@ ila !
you can help me .
go tell her i love her and want to marry her .
- you want to marry an ...
- an ar@@ ab .
so ?
i won 't be the first .
the wife of the general in constant@@ ine is ar@@ ab .
no , she 's kab@@ yle .
le@@ ila ...
you know her , so go see her and tell her i love her .
please . i beg you ! do it for me .
arrang@@ ing mar@@ ri@@ ages is for old women .
she 's your friend , she 'll listen to you .
fine , i 'll play mat@@ ch@@ mak@@ er .
just for you !
- and your mission ?
- that 's the other good news .
abd el-@@ kader is ready to nego@@ ti@@ ate .
i no@@ ti@@ fied lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , who in@@ formed bu@@ ge@@ aud .
- there 's going to be a tru@@ ce .
- you don 't know arab@@ s .
it 's a r@@ use . they 'll keep fighting .
you 're one to talk , le@@ ila .
aren 't you ar@@ ab ?
not at all . i 'm kab@@ yle .
i 'm not mus@@ lim , but christian .
anyway ... religion is all that matters here .
it 's more important than blood , more important than anything !
you think he really loves me ?
he 's been with so many women .
do you love him ? i don 't know .
my father wants to give me to a friend of his .
he may be the love of your life .
all i know is i want to be his wife - and bear his children .
- sounds like love .
you know it 's up to the men .
my father won 't let me marry an in@@ fi@@ del .
that can be arrang@@ ed .
he adores you .
i don 't even know if od@@ il@@ on loves me .
i had to kiss him .
go see old zara for a love po@@ tion .
we already have one : this , - this and this .
- le@@ ila , you sound like a wh@@ ore . that 's what we are !
fa@@ thers sell us like she@@ ep .
don 't say that .
women serve men and bear their children .
i 'll choose my own husband .
- i 've already chosen .
- you love him ?
i want him . i 'll get him .
so ?
she loves you .
she 'll marry you on one condition .
- anything !
- she can only marry a mus@@ lim .
- that doesn 't bo@@ de well .
- there 's a way :
become mus@@ lim .
why not ?
go see the imam , say , " allah is great , " muhammad is his proph@@ et " and it 's done !
why not ?
i 've already thought about it .
islam is a good religion .
no pri@@ ests , no bis@@ ho@@ ps , no po@@ pe .
just you and god .
anyway , it 's the same god for everyone .
yes , but ... circum@@ cis@@ ion ?
circum@@ cis@@ ion .
don 't worry .
the bar@@ ber will give your willy a clean cut .
plus , he uses an english sha@@ ver .
sure you want to get circum@@ cis@@ ed ?
i have to to become mus@@ lim .
let me do it instead of that but@@ cher .
he 's not a but@@ cher , he 's a bar@@ ber .
that 's worse .
you don 't know the words that need to be said .
i 'm giving a part of myself to god .
want me to go with you ?
hel@@ ie !
i envi@@ ed him in a way .
he threw himself into everything , while i , the good jesu@@ it student , weig@@ hed the pro@@ s and cons for so long , i 'd never decide .
should i marry le@@ ila ?
she was beautiful and be@@ wit@@ ching , but she scared me like this country did .
done .
- we 're brothers now .
- go !
the br@@ ute had to do it 3 times !
told you so .
i 'll band@@ age you at the hospital .
i 'm mus@@ lim like you , si kad@@ d@@ our .
you gave me your word .
" i 'll give you my daughter if you become mus@@ lim . "
will you give her to me now ?
i gave you my word , so i will . as long as the un@@ cles agree .
what 's it to them ?
they 're the el@@ ders , wise men .
they decide for the family .
it 's tradition .
are you circum@@ cis@@ ed ?
what i wouldn 't do for you , bahia ...
so , are you done inspec@@ ting me ?
they agree .
i 'm grateful .
you can have bahia , but there 's the dow@@ ry .
the dow@@ ry .
how much ?
- 1,000 francs .
- alright .
and 50 she@@ ep .
fifty she@@ ep ?
where would i find those ?
buy them .
from whom ?
me .
if you want to .
- con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations ! - thanks .
bu@@ ge@@ aud signed a peace treat@@ y with abd el-@@ kader .
the treat@@ y of taf@@ na recogn@@ iz@@ es his authority over 2 / 3 of alger@@ ia .
the emir set up his camp on the tag@@ de@@ mp@@ t plateau , between mas@@ cara and the ou@@ arsen@@ is mountains .
i 'm worried , hubert .
why , colonel ?
you wanted everyone to stay where they belong@@ ed .
i hear he 's a lo@@ yal fellow .
he can 't stand our presence on mus@@ lim ground .
it 's a question of religion , which is sac@@ red .
don 't forget , hubert , that the emir is a proph@@ et as well as a military man and a po@@ et .
only islam is capable of produc@@ ing such men .
we sent him a delegation .
he re@@ quest@@ ed a doctor to treat his sick mother .
i ap@@ pointed you .
go to him . try to get in his good grac@@ es and keep me ap@@ pris@@ ed each week .
you can count on me , colonel .
enjoy your dinner , last night ?
yes , colonel .
on be@@ half of my master , emir abd el-@@ kader , prince of the fa@@ ith@@ ful , defen@@ der of the proph@@ et 's religion , welcome .
on be@@ half of france and science , i came to help the emir and his family .
our emir is sad .
his mother , the holy and re@@ vered zo@@ h@@ ra , is seriously ill .
if you cure her , he 'll shower you with gif@@ ts .
i don 't need gif@@ ts .
your master 's grat@@ itude will be ample re@@ ward .
- she 's burning up !
- it often happens to her .
it 's malaria .
- then it 's up to god .
- there 's a new medi@@ cation :
quin@@ ine .
i prepared a po@@ tion with qu@@ ina bar@@ k .
careful . it 's quite bitter .
she must take a sip every 2 hours .
i 'll be back tomorrow .
this is your house .
just ask if you need anything .
the emir will see you tomorrow morning .
i 'll come get you .
rest in peace .
go see the french doc . you 'll do his cook@@ ing and cle@@ aning .
the doctor is a sp@@ y .
watch his every move .
bring me anything that he writ@@ es .
got it ?
what will you give me for that ?
like she said , your uncle wants me for his har@@ em .
your uncle 's rich .
i 'll find you a husband .
young or old , but rich .
you 're pretty , you 'll get your pick .
who are these prison@@ ers ?
the lead@@ ers of a re@@ bel tri@@ be .
the ben z@@ et@@ oun .
welcome to my home .
have a seat .
i 'm happy that french science could serve the mother of the prince of the fa@@ ith@@ ful .
it 's a good ex@@ ample of what we can bring your country .
medicine was invent@@ ed by an ar@@ ab .
i plan on setting up a university .
our doc@@ tors will be as good as french ones .
why waste time when france offered you to ski@@ p centur@@ ies and enter the modern world .
a new world could come out of the union of the east and the west .
arab@@ s weren 't made to so@@ w whe@@ at and build cities .
- we 're nom@@ ads , sons of the wind .
- nothing solid is built on wind .
nothing solid is built without god .
god is with me . i only listen to him .
he for@@ bi@@ ds me from letting any mus@@ lim live - under christian domination .
- we don 't want to domin@@ ate you , but to bring you the benef@@ its of civiliz@@ ation and progress .
when god wants to hurt an ant , he gives it wings .
full of pride and joy , it takes to the sky .
then a little bird sees it and swal@@ lows it .
we 'll be friends if everyone st@@ ays where they bel@@ ong .
we value freedom ! only a holy war can bring freedom and indepen@@ dence .
a holy war never re@@ quired anyone but@@ cher@@ ing their enemy , like i saw at ain tem@@ ou@@ chent .
we 've made peace .
come see me whenever you please .
you 'll be welcome wh@@ er@@ ever i am .
this is from the emir .
it 's yours .
i can 't accept it .
refus@@ ing a gift is a grave insul@@ t .
- who 's she ?
- a servant for you .
- where 's my servant ahmed ?
- he asked to join the army of the fa@@ ith@@ ful .
na@@ ou@@ el 's a better cook .
na@@ ou@@ el .
you speak french ?
where are you from ?
kab@@ y@@ lia .
my father worked for a french lieutenant at the ar@@ ab office .
the emir 's soldiers came to our village .
they killed the lieutenant , ...
don 't worry , i 'll treat you well .
you 're my father and mother to me .
good night .
where will you sleep ?
- next door .
- there 's no bed .
i sleep on the floor .
call me if you need anything .
wait .
stay a while .
you smell nice .
let me guess ...
close your eyes .
good morning .
so , the coffee 's tur@@ kis@@ h , the milk is from a go@@ at , but the bread is mine .
happy ?
- don 't kiss me like that .
- you 're my master , i 'm yours .
this is :
na@@ ou@@ el was the mist@@ res@@ s-@@ servant every man secre@@ tly dreams of .
i do@@ ve head first into the be@@ wit@@ ching world of islam , which mixed no@@ bil@@ ity , po@@ etr@@ y and cru@@ el@@ ty , and where god comman@@ ded every move .
i was far from everything , el@@ se@@ where . i never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life .
the emir had just come back from a long expedition in the sahara .
you were right , colonel .
he 's been taking advantage , these last 2 years , of the fal@@ se peace to rule over the other trib@@ es .
he 's pl@@ under@@ ed the kab@@ y@@ lia , the ou@@ arsen@@ is , the tit@@ teri and now the sahara .
will he ever unite these disper@@ sed trib@@ es ?
if he does , it 'll be in sp@@ ite of us .
the women at the sou@@ k are saying the war with the french is about to start again .
i 'm scared .
if there 's a war , you 'll leave without me .
of course not .
i 'll take you with me .
there 's a ru@@ mor that host@@ ilit@@ ies will res@@ ume against the french .
the emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infan@@ try ,
2,000 caval@@ ry , 20 field guns , and 240 gun@@ ners .
add to that , 60,000 ir@@ regul@@ ars ar@@ med with french rif@@ les they got off our dead or from their prison@@ ers , and english guns the british consul sol@@ d them .
od@@ il@@ on ?
hel@@ ie ?
- i 'm so happy to see you !
- so am i. how are you ?
well .
have a seat .
- three stri@@ pes !
bravo !
- same to you .
haven 't you heard ? you 've been prom@@ ot@@ ed .
this is such a remo@@ te place .
- hey ! she 's ste@@ aling a letter !
- no , it 's na@@ ou@@ el .
she br@@ ings my letters to the leg@@ ation .
your servant ?
- you trust her ?
- of course . well , she 's more than my servant .
she 's my girlfriend .
- are you kid@@ ding me ?
- i 'm in love .
good thing i 'm here .
you 're so nai@@ ve , od@@ il@@ on .
she 's here to sp@@ y on you .
that 's what the arab@@ s do !
can we talk about something else ?
what br@@ ings you here ?
i 'm here with the major .
we came to see abd el-@@ kader to pre@@ vent a new out@@ break .
what 's going on ?
our gener@@ als have cap@@ tured constant@@ ine .
to join al@@ gi@@ ers and constant@@ ine , they occu@@ pied a territory abd el-@@ kader thinks is his .
is he right ?
we 're obviously being dis@@ honest .
so are the arab@@ s .
abd el-@@ kader ke@@ eps saying that god willing , he 'll throw the french into the sea .
after all , this is his land not ours .
if we leave , alger@@ ia will go back to chaos .
what about the union of the east and the west ?
we need peace first .
and freedom and equ@@ ality for arab@@ s . not a forced union .
win@@ ning is all our gener@@ als want .
they want to sub@@ due the nat@@ ives .
believe me , you should head back to oran .
- le@@ ila is waiting for you .
- how 's bahia ?
i forgot to tell you . i have a son .
- really ?
- ish@@ ma@@ el .
he 's almost a year old .
i hope you 'll atten@@ d his circum@@ cis@@ ion .
i wouldn 't miss it .
the french didn 't keep their word .
the duke of orleans and mar@@ sha@@ l val@@ ee crossed the iron gates and viol@@ ated my territory .
it 's an af@@ front to our dign@@ ity .
i wrote to louis-@@ philippe , the king of france .
he didn 't even reply .
my men are in favor of a holy war .
the his@@ sing of bul@@ lets is worth more than fresh@@ water .
that would be a mistake .
france is stronger .
it has soldiers , can@@ ons , ships .
i am not scared .
allah is with me .
my friends and i want freedom and equ@@ ality for every alger@@ ian and french person .
perhaps , but it 's your gener@@ als who lay down the law .
win@@ ning is like sal@@ t@@ water , the more you drink ,
- the thir@@ st@@ ier you get .
- no matter who w@@ ins , a lot of men will fall under enemy fire .
it 's fate , not bul@@ lets , that kill .
muslim@@ s are ready to die for their faith .
the kor@@ an says , " heaven lies in the shade of s@@ words . "
i chose the honor@@ able path : war .
war@@ n your people , so they can 't say they weren 't given fair warning .
had@@ j ham@@ ou will take you to the french out@@ post .
may allah watch over you and your family .
i 'll never forget you saved my mother .
may allah guide you towards fair and honor@@ able peace .
far@@ e@@ well .
na@@ ou@@ el ?
- where 's na@@ ou@@ el ?
- she 's gone .
- where ?
- back to the har@@ em .
what ?
she 's leaving with me .
you can 't expect a mus@@ lim to follow an in@@ fi@@ del .
- i want to see her .
- she doesn 't want to see you .
you 're lying !
she wants to leave with me .
you 're nai@@ ve , lieutenant hubert .
i sent her here to sp@@ y on you .
i don 't believe you .
you 're lying .
she showed me all your letters .
" 8,000 infan@@ try , 2,000 caval@@ ry , 20 field guns . "
you 're well in@@ formed .
get over it .
you 're a soldier .
you should know that a man who trust@@ s a woman isn 't a real man .
fight me !
you 're the emir 's guest .
he ordered me to see to your safety .
hospit@@ ality is sac@@ red to muslim@@ s .
you 're my guest .
i have to protect you .
- i owe you my life .
- i 'll kill you next time .
... with sugar , milk , dates and rais@@ ins is a de@@ light !
- le@@ ila will be eating with us .
- i see , it 's a conspir@@ acy .
you should make up your mind .
she 's perfect for you .
- don 't you like her ?
- of course i do .
so marry her !
don 't be like every single officer here who sh@@ acks up with a broad , but won 't be seen in public with her .
sorry , i ... you 're right .
it 's all in the past .
- let 's talk shop .
excuse me , i must take care of ish@@ ma@@ el .
i 'll join you .
le@@ ila , i wanted to tell you ...
what ?
fir@@ st@@ ly ... i have something to conf@@ ess .
the kab@@ yle girl ?
i know .
hel@@ ie told me .
he should mind his own business .
it 's different between us , isn 't it ?
so you 'd be willing to ...
ladies and gentlem@@ en , i raise my glass to captain hubert who just ear@@ ned a well-@@ de@@ served third stri@@ pe . to his lovely wife , our hospital 's head nurse , whose beauty and compet@@ ence will support her husband 's brilli@@ ant career .
our best w@@ ishes to the new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds .
their union is celebr@@ ated under favorable aus@@ pic@@ es .
our tro@@ ops just crus@@ hed the regular army of abd el-@@ kader , who wanted to challenge us to a battle .
but in vain .
his tro@@ ops were ann@@ ih@@ il@@ ated , thanks to my friend , colonel yusuf .
ladies and gentlem@@ en , to love and victory !
you 're very opti@@ mist@@ ic , general .
abd el-@@ kader has lost the battle but not the war .
he started a guer@@ illa war and is stir@@ ring up the trib@@ es .
here and there , perhaps .
but trust me , he lost face and there@@ fore the game .
it 's only a question of time now .
bu@@ ge@@ aud was named gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general .
he 's bringing 100,000 men .
we 'll be able to pull out all the stop@@ s .
things are clear to paris .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
we 'll turn it into a modern country .
what are they doing ?
- how do you like it ?
- it 's su@@ bl@@ ime .
- thank you .
- want something to drink ? - two gran@@ itas .
- two gran@@ itas , please .
- where did you get that ?
- in a je@@ wish store .
- it su@@ its you .
- thank you .
i pre@@ fer north african dres@@ ses . they 're more myster@@ ious .
ero@@ tic@@ ism reli@@ es on mystery .
is it true that abd el-@@ kader is 20 km from al@@ gi@@ ers ?
he was . he ra@@ i@@ ded the mit@@ id@@ ja and van@@ ished without a trace .
we haven 't seen the last of him .
this morning , we met the royal committee for the development of alger@@ ia .
there 'll be a rail@@ road from al@@ gi@@ ers to bli@@ da .
the mineral@@ og@@ ical map says we have co@@ al ...
we 're late , od@@ il@@ on .
we 're expected at noon .
your ke@@ pi .
- wait for us for lunch . - yes .
good day to you , sir .
colon@@ iz@@ ation is at a stand@@ still .
what 's the use of con@@ quer@@ ing land if no one sett@@ les there ?
no one wants to sett@@ le on a foreign land that hasn 't been completely pacif@@ ied .
it will be , lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , it will be !
i swear we 'll take out the tras@@ h by any means necessary !
but i won 't do it for s@@ wis@@ s or austri@@ an sett@@ lers ! those ignor@@ ant dr@@ un@@ ks !
you 're right , general .
to make the most out of these huge areas the nom@@ adi@@ c arab@@ s have ne@@ gle@@ c@@ ted , we need big capit@@ alist compan@@ ies who pos@@ s@@ ess great means .
we re@@ commen@@ d it , as the modern and effec@@ tive way .
fid@@ d@@ lest@@ icks !
that 's typ@@ ical of your saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian friends .
a bunch of dre@@ amer@@ s and vision@@ aries !
you see , lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , i haven 't been to the poly@@ technique , un@@ like yourself .
i 'm a soldier and a far@@ mer .
i learned everything on my limous@@ in farm .
the mit@@ id@@ ja isn 't the beau@@ ce .
may i respec@@ t@@ fully point out , general , that the limous@@ in isn 't the mit@@ id@@ ja either .
believe it or not , captain to@@ us@@ saint , i had noticed that .
" ense et ar@@ atro . " it 's my mot@@ to .
with the sword and p@@ low .
like cinc@@ in@@ nat@@ us , the roman far@@ mer@@ -@@ soldier . veter@@ ans can sett@@ le here after their service is done :
p@@ low , horse , rif@@ le .
i 'll even give them w@@ ives .
nat@@ ives ?
my chief of staff , who 's reti@@ red , is now the mayor of to@@ ulon .
he can get me serv@@ ants , wid@@ o@@ ws , single women ... you catch my dri@@ ft .
ger@@ maine , do you take gustave to be your husband , to be fa@@ ith@@ ful un@@ to him and be part of the church ?
- i do .
- gustave , do you take ger@@ maine to be your wife , to be fa@@ ith@@ ful un@@ to her and be part of the church ?
- you are now joined in holy mat@@ rim@@ ony .
here are your rings .
poor girl .
- i hear she 's an or@@ phan .
- who knows , she might be happy .
fat chance !
it 's the luck of the draw .
- ger@@ main , do you take ...
- know what they 're doing ?
they 've giving land to young soldiers who 've complet@@ ed 5 of their 7 years of service .
- so ?
- so they won 't leave .
they 'll have to spend at least 2 more years here .
here is your title of ow@@ ner@@ ship , a p@@ low and a horse to go with it , and a rif@@ le to defend yourself against those bastar@@ ds .
mad@@ am , here is the key to your house .
live happ@@ ily and prosp@@ er .
here is your title of ow@@ ner@@ ship , a p@@ low and a horse to go with it , and a rif@@ le to defend yourself against those bastar@@ ds .
- thank you , general .
- mad@@ am , here is the key - to your house . - thank you .
live happ@@ ily and prosp@@ er .
friends ! after having con@@ quer@@ ed this land in the name of france , you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children .
i wish you all the best .
drum roll .
we 're ste@@ aling the arab@@ s ' land , general .
no need to ex@@ ag@@ gerate .
they weren 't using it .
but smal@@ l-@@ scale far@@ ming won 't turn alger@@ ia into beau@@ ce .
if abd el-@@ kader lets us .
the gover@@ nor chose to send 3 un@@ its after him .
i 'm to command one .
with all due respect , i 'm not sure i 'd like to join the hunt .
you don 't have a choice , to@@ us@@ saint .
i 've just received word you 'll be serv@@ ing under the young duke of au@@ male who 'll command yusuf 's unit .
you 'll be his interpre@@ ter and hubert , his medical officer .
the king 's son !
that 's rather flat@@ tering .
i regret losing you , but it 'll be good for your car@@ e@@ ers .
colonel yusuf spotted the smal@@ ah .
it el@@ u@@ ded us twice in 4 days , but we have it now .
it 's here ! by the tag@@ u@@ ine well . the tro@@ ops , the women and children .
how on earth can they move camp that quickly ?
i don 't know , my lord .
it 's incredi@@ ble .
is abd el-@@ kader with them ?
i didn 't want to sound the alarm by getting too close .
- when abd el-@@ kader isn 't there , he leaves 500 men .
we have enough caval@@ ry@@ men .
let 's go .
we should wait for the infan@@ try . they 're 3 hours away .
sound the charge , lieutenant .
my lord , the duke of au@@ male told me to in@@ form you that he cap@@ tured abd el-@@ kader 's smal@@ ah at noon on may 16 .
we left with the caval@@ ry at dawn and en@@ counter@@ ed them at noon .
i 'll never forget this extraordin@@ aire event .
get to the point , my friend .
the african chas@@ seurs went around the smal@@ ah to take it from the re@@ ar while colonel yusuf laun@@ ched a fron@@ tal attack .
chaos and panic en@@ su@@ ed . there was a stam@@ pe@@ de .
good .
very well indeed .
what about abd el-@@ kader ?
he wasn 't there , general .
general ! we cap@@ tured 300 notables and war@@ lor@@ ds , their famili@@ es , horses and she@@ ep , and abd el-@@ kader 's war chest :
a wonderful boot@@ y .
it almost cost the duke of au@@ male his life .
coming , hubert ?
- so ?
- all hope is lost , my lord .
guard !
move away !
let the women and child go and i 'll sur@@ ren@@ der !
take them away .
you saved my life , captain .
is there anything you want ?
give me the 3 prison@@ ers .
they 're yours .
she wants to see you .
she 's waiting for you outside .
- why did you abandon me , od@@ il@@ on ?
- abandon you ?
you sp@@ ied on me and betr@@ ayed me .
you believed him ?
i knew it .
had@@ j ham@@ ou kid@@ n@@ apped me and put me in his har@@ em .
and the letters ?
he only managed to get one from me .
i 'm here , od@@ il@@ on , to tell you
i never betr@@ ayed you .
but you doub@@ ted me .
no .
you didn 't love me enough .
is that your son ?
ours .
ais@@ sa .
no one must ever know , otherwise had@@ j ham@@ ou will kill my son and i .
i 'm his wife .
he put me in his har@@ em .
he never asked me anything .
had@@ j ham@@ ou is a good man ,
he 's a good husband and father .
ais@@ sa and i are his .
i simply wanted you to know .
hel@@ ie told me you 're married .
i am .
i had mis@@ jud@@ ged her .
- she 's a good person .
your worl@@ ds are too different .
- you 're one to talk .
- it 's not the same for me .
you think a man can love several women at once ?
muslim@@ s can have up to 4 women .
but there 's always a favorite .
some must sometimes love 2 women equ@@ ally .
i 'm done .
come in .
you wanted to kill me and almost did .
- it wasn 't god 's will .
- i know i owe you my life . so you 're free to go .
- i 'll take up arms again .
- that 's your right .
- i 'm inde@@ b@@ ted to you .
- no , we 're even now .
set na@@ ou@@ el and the child free .
we 're now bound for life , you and i .
it is our destiny .
i thought the battle of the smal@@ ah would end the war , but abd el-@@ kader would be on the run for another 4 years .
for 4 years , hel@@ ie and i wit@@ nes@@ sed yusuf and lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere 's hell@@ ish raz@@ z@@ ias which were answered by pil@@ es of sever@@ ed french heads .
the emir f@@ led to mor@@ oc@@ co , where he was followed by bu@@ ge@@ aud who won the battle of is@@ ly .
the following year , abd el-@@ kader but@@ cher@@ ed a french bat@@ tal@@ ion at si@@ di-@@ bra@@ him .
on christmas eve 1847 , after having resist@@ ed one of the most powerful coun@@ tries on earth for 15 years , the emir admitted defe@@ at .
it was god 's will .
bu@@ dge call !
accept this horse as sub@@ mission .
it 's the last one i 'll ride .
i will now go on foot .
i accept your hom@@ age to france , which gr@@ ants you its protection , as a sign that the past has been for@@ given .
you cu@@ red my holy mother .
may god watch over you and yours .
had i had men like yours , i 'd now be in al@@ gi@@ ers .
since you defe@@ ated me , you 're the only person i can entr@@ ust with the weapons i used in the last 15 years of fighting you .
i will not be ne@@ eding them anymore .
i will devo@@ te the rest of my life to god .
god is great .
past enem@@ ies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart .
you may see me as alive , but i am dead .
squ@@ ad@@ ron leader hubert , on be@@ half of his majest@@ y louis-@@ philippe , i ap@@ point you knight of the legion of honor .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , hubert , and thank you again .
squ@@ ad@@ ron leader to@@ us@@ saint , on be@@ half of his majest@@ y , i ap@@ point you knight of the legion of honor .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
end of the proclam@@ ation !
- con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , dear friends .
- thank you .
you deserve it .
a lot re@@ mains to be done in this great country .
we 'll build it instead of destroy it .
you know there 's fighting in paris right now .
there 's talk of a second republic .
so we 'll finally see that republic .
- what will happen to alger@@ ia ?
- a republic means liberty , equ@@ ality and frat@@ ern@@ ity for every man .
trans@@ lation :
mag@@ enta bar@@ i@@ beau ep@@ ilo@@ gue
welcome to alger@@ ia , where much re@@ mains to be done .
the saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans ' mission is clear :
we want to protect the arab@@ s ' language and religion .
i came to help the emir 's family with french knowledge .
may allah protect them .
i chose the honor@@ able path : war .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in bro@@ th@@ els and have forgotten your mission .
i found a way to contact ad@@ bel@@ kader .
violence is the only thing arab@@ s respect .
these sav@@ ages must die !
this is a gen@@ oci@@ de , not a war .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers even wrote that we 're the barbar@@ ians .
a to@@ ast to his lovely wife .
our best w@@ ishes to the new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds .
you think a man can love several women simultan@@ e@@ ously ?
there 's always a favorite .
i never betr@@ ayed you .
no one must ever know , otherwise had@@ j ham@@ ou will kill my son and i .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
you 're the only person i can entr@@ ust with the weapons i used to fight you these last 15 years .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 2 .
death 's fi@@ an@@ cee
mother ...
jeremy ?
emile and jeanne must do the home@@ work that i spent last night prepar@@ ing .
thank you .
had we stayed in oran , instead of moving to this god@@ for@@ sak@@ en place , our children could go to school and get a normal education .
as soon as we have the money , we 'll send them to the al@@ gi@@ ers boar@@ ding school .
did you know that the boy with ty@@ pho@@ id died ?
i know .
i did all i could .
i hope they won 't catch it .
they played with him .
is there any milk , d@@ jam@@ ila ?
not that one .
i don 't like go@@ at milk .
it 's s@@ our .
there aren 't any co@@ ws here , swe@@ eti@@ e .
we wouldn 't be here if your father hadn 't left the army .
where is he going , mother ?
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republic@@ an and pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
nothing to be as@@ ham@@ ed of .
i was a republic@@ an .
the ' 48 revolution hit paris , then oran .
i believed in the new republic . and i still do . and i 'm most certainly pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
the europe@@ ans mixed up revolution and beat@@ ings .
i paid the price after napoleon iii 's dec@@ ember ' 51 coup .
don 't stay there . you have plenty of room .
spread it out !
le@@ ila wanted us to leave for france .
but leaving alger@@ ia was out of the question .
so i rent@@ ed this farm from a sett@@ ler from ar@@ ie@@ ge who became dis@@ hear@@ tened and left with a bad f@@ ever .
" these dates are excellent . "
period .
" the um@@ bre@@ lla is ... " a nice shade " of red . "
- what 's wrong , jeanne ?
- my stomach hur@@ ts .
you don 't have a f@@ ever .
ya@@ oul@@ ed wrote " um@@ pre@@ lla . "
- with a p !
- stop te@@ asing ya@@ oul@@ ed .
i 'd like to see you write arab@@ ic !
he can 't write arab@@ ic either !
don 't listen to him . you 've made tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous progress .
- he made 15 mist@@ akes yesterday .
- you made 12 !
why isn 't is@@ hem here ?
she 's a girl .
her father won 't allow it .
- why not ?
- she might get ideas .
alright . let 's continue .
the cam@@ el has big teeth .
ya@@ oul@@ ed , make sure your she@@ ep don 't eat my wife 's flowers .
why are you calling me ya@@ oul@@ ed ?
i 'm ahmed .
you 're oran 's ya@@ oul@@ ed to me .
go get the others , ahmed , i 've got a surprise .
try them on . you 'll be able to work faster .

you 're a doc , - there might be some wo@@ unded .
- go get my kit .
antoine ?
marie ?
sav@@ ages ! mad@@ men !
come .
there 's nothing we can do here .
go get help at the village . we 'll give them a nice bur@@ ial .
mad@@ men !
what 's the army waiting for ?
you know they hate sett@@ lers .
they 're sav@@ ages !
the only solution is to er@@ adic@@ ate them , like the americ@@ ans did with the indi@@ ans .
this is their land .
they were wast@@ ing it .
don 't make exc@@ uses for them !
i 'm not !
i 'm only trying to understand .
there 's nothing to understand , hubert !
their own brothers ...
why ? why !
" had@@ jou@@ ts " kill in@@ fi@@ del@@ s and trait@@ ors
- so they can go to heaven . - bull@@ shit !
that 's what the mar@@ about said .
it 's holy war , " ji@@ had . "
the man who kil@@ ls goes to heaven .
why are they wearing their shoes around their ne@@ cks ?
their feet hurt .
they pre@@ fer going bar@@ e@@ foot .
- but they cost me a fortune !
- good .
they won 't get used .
the wor@@ kers want to invite you and your wife to thank you .
there 's way too much .
we can 't eat all this .
polit@@ en@@ ess dic@@ tat@@ es you have to eat a lot .
then you bur@@ p and say that you 're full .
he 'll be pleased .
this is stupid .
they probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning .
- they 're gener@@ ous and be@@ having like lor@@ ds .
it 's del@@ icious .
he has trach@@ oma .
we have to do something .
he can come to the farm whenever he wants .
it 's because of marie . - it 's a race .
- they should close the val@@ ve .
that 's right , blame allah .
- you 're not married ?
- i 'm not rich enough .
wash his eyes every@@ day or he 'll become blind .
always wash children 's hands and faces .
- we don 't have much water .
- come get some at the farm .
not too tired ?
are you due soon ?
mother ...
jeanne is crying .
what 's wrong ?
what 's going on ?
ty@@ pho@@ id f@@ ever !
i knew it .
she 'll die !
- calm down .
we 'll treat her .
- stop it ! i 'm a nurse !
everyone around is dying of chol@@ era , ty@@ pho@@ id and dys@@ enter@@ y !
you 're ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
4@@ 28 people died at the " fun@@ du@@ q " last year .
and 94 in bou@@ far@@ ik .
the mit@@ id@@ ja is a rotten s@@ wam@@ p !
the arab@@ s were right calling it " death 's fi@@ an@@ cee . "
if the mos@@ quit@@ o@@ es don 't get us , had@@ jou@@ ts will sli@@ t our thro@@ ats
- and we 'll all die ! - enough !
you 're exhaust@@ ed .
go to bed .
i 'll take care of jeanne .
yes , i 'm exhaust@@ ed .
i can 't stand it .
i want to leave .
i 'll leave with the kids if you want to stay .
how will you get by ?
we don 't have any money .
i 'll find work as a nurse or as a ma@@ id .
the children will go to school .
i want to leave .
then leave !
i can 't stand your constant wh@@ in@@ ing !
come with us . i beg you !
no .
i bel@@ ong here .
- hurry , mother !
i 'll go see the chief physic@@ ian at the mustafa hospital .
he agreed to hire me .
- he 's a good man .
- i hope you 'll enjoy yourself .
al@@ gi@@ ers is full of thie@@ ves and advent@@ ur@@ ers .
will you come visit ?
i 'll visit the children . time permit@@ ting .
take them to bli@@ da .
the army has set up convo@@ ys to al@@ gi@@ ers .
goodbye , swe@@ eti@@ e .
goodbye , emile .
- bye , d@@ jam@@ ila .
- we never should have come here .
i know .
take care of yourself .
gee up !
i 've had enough of paris .
it 's so gray and expen@@ sive here .
i don 't have any friends .
why don 't we go home to al@@ gi@@ ers ?
i hear le@@ ila and her children are there .
- what about od@@ il@@ on ?
- he stayed on the farm .
i don 't get him .
we always said :
the land is for the arab@@ s , commerce , industry and mines for the french .
you 're not listening to me .
i don 't feel at home here .
the children are te@@ ased at school because they 're mus@@ lim and the sal@@ es@@ girls don 't respect me .
i 'm fighting for you , the children and the alger@@ ians , so people will respect your religion , val@@ ues and the color of your skin .
alger@@ ia 's fate is being decided here in paris .
we 've been here for years and no one listened to you .
the republic no longer exist@@ s . the republic no longer exist@@ s .
this is an empire , but nothing has changed .
you 're wrong .
remember fle@@ ury ?
- the young lieutenant ?
- he 's a general now ,
his majest@@ y 's clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ or .
i sent him my pam@@ ph@@ lets and my book .
he read them to the emper@@ or .
it 'll happen , you 'll see .
then we 'll go home ? i promise .
we 'll go home to alger@@ ia .
i love you , bahia .
so it doesn 't matter where we are .
you 're right .
my dear to@@ us@@ saint , we have good news for you .
they 're about to start building the al@@ gier@@ s-@@ bli@@ da rail@@ road .
our friend four@@ nel is surve@@ ying alger@@ ia 's mineral re@@ sources . - he sent his report .
- quite prom@@ ising .
- we plan to inv@@ est .
- large sum@@ s .
thank you , sir@@ s .
with your help , alger@@ ia will become
- a modern country .
- ap@@ ologies for my tar@@ din@@ ess .
we 're making head@@ way . the emper@@ or fre@@ ed ad@@ bel@@ kader and author@@ ized him to leave france for tur@@ key .
as the duke of au@@ male and general lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere had promised him when he sur@@ ren@@ dered over 5 years ago .
despite this promise , france kept him prison@@ er - all these years . - i know , i know .
that was during king louis-@@ philippe 's re@@ ign .
the emper@@ or made am@@ ends .
he brought ad@@ bel@@ kader to long@@ champ rac@@ es , the opera , a@@ war@@ ded him the legion of honor .
we 're now best friends .
won 't his liberation fu@@ el alger@@ ia 's holy war ?
he promised never to take up arms against france .
the only way to en@@ sure peace in alger@@ ia is to make it an independent colon@@ y where all alger@@ ians would be equ@@ al cit@@ iz@@ ens .
the emper@@ or is in favor of that .
he spent most of his ex@@ ile in england and ad@@ mi@@ res
- british institutions .
- so what 's he waiting for ? it 's time to give that territory its own stat@@ ute .
he has other wor@@ ries :
russia , ital@@ y ...
didn 't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that alger@@ ia was and would remain a french province ?
isn 't this matter already closed ?
i hope not .
wanting arab@@ s to ab@@ ide by french rules would be a mistake .
they have different custom@@ s and val@@ ues and another religion .
grab a plate . eat with me .
no , it 's por@@ k .
- i can 't eat it .
- there must be some chicken too .
thank you .
straight ! you want a straight line !
get out of here !
i said leave !
there you are .
can you tell that idiot to leave my land ?
these dar@@ n nom@@ ads don 't respect private property .
of course .
they don 't know what that is .
what he say ?
that it 's communal land that belong@@ s to everyone .
are you kid@@ ding ?
he knows i bought it from the government .
scr@@ am !
look at that strange se@@ t-@@ up .
it 's a great concept .
the cam@@ el is strong , but doesn 't walk straight .
the don@@ key does .
- it 's quite ingen@@ ious .
- i see you 're still pro-@@ ar@@ ab . they 're bad neighbor@@ s .
so you sent your wife and kids to al@@ gi@@ ers ?
- she wanted to leave .
- can 't blame her .
this is a hard place for women and children .
come see me tomorrow .
i 'll be plant@@ ing a liberty tree .
we can have a drink .
it 'll take your mind off things .
friends , this liberty tree is just like those we plant@@ ed in france during the ' 48 revolution , a symbol of our faith in the republic .
napoleon iii dese@@ cr@@ ated the second republic and depor@@ ted 12,000 of us to these wild african lands .
why ?
because guer@@ in stood on the high@@ est bar@@ ric@@ ade at the fau@@ bourg saint-@@ antoine .
because rou@@ car@@ ies refused to use his journ@@ alist@@ ic tal@@ ents to serve the us@@ ur@@ per .
bravo !
and you , lu@@ do@@ vic , because the town@@ spe@@ ople had elec@@ ted you republic@@ an mayor !
they wanted to break us , but we and our span@@ ish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this alger@@ ian land are capable of !
let 's turn this rotten mit@@ id@@ ja into a garden that we can one day trans@@ form into a new republic .
i propose the creation of a sett@@ lers association and a new@@ sp@@ aper , " the sett@@ ler 's voice , "
that rou@@ car@@ ies will manage .
long live the republic !
music !
don 't forget republic@@ an princip@@ les mean liberty , equ@@ ality and frat@@ ern@@ ity for everyone , including arab@@ s .
you must be kid@@ ding , hubert .
these sav@@ ages cut our com@@ patri@@ ots ' thro@@ ats !
you want to turn them into fren@@ ch@@ men ?
you abol@@ ished sla@@ very in ' 48 .
be coher@@ ent .
arab@@ s are men like you and i. we 're all brothers .
what a ser@@ mon !
leave that to the ar@@ ab represent@@ atives .
beni sas@@ sen 's ka@@ id is throwing a party next week .
captain au@@ dr@@ an invit@@ ed us .
come with , you 'll see .
you 're going ?
it 's id al-@@ adha , an important mus@@ lim holiday . we sacrif@@ ice she@@ ep to com@@ memor@@ ate abraham 's sacrif@@ ice .
wasn 't abraham je@@ wish ?
juda@@ ism , christian@@ ity and islam are sister religi@@ ons ,
talking about she@@ ep ...
you know it 's the nom@@ ads ' main source of in@@ come .
they say they don 't have enough graz@@ ing fields .
au@@ dr@@ an , i see what you 're getting at .
their she@@ ep graz@@ ing on our land is a real problem .
they tr@@ ample our se@@ ed@@ lings and eat our whe@@ at .
one flo@@ ck of she@@ ep graz@@ ed on your land .
we paid the fine .
they 're nom@@ ads . they can go el@@ se@@ where .
each tri@@ be fol@@ lows its own route .
setting foot on another tri@@ be 's land could start a war .
that 's their problem .
you 're not making my job any easier .
we 're trying to build trust with trib@@ es lo@@ yal to our country but the en@@ camp@@ ment polic@@ y , which was adop@@ ted against the army 's ad@@ vice and gave you land that belong@@ ed to the arab@@ s , is turning the trib@@ es against us and under@@ min@@ ing our work .
what work ?
we 're the wor@@ kers here , not you or them .
you wouldn 't be here without the army !
that 's an entrance !
yes , they know how to fight !
you said it .
you don 't want these hor@@ sem@@ en to become our enem@@ ies again .
don 't worry , captain .
we know how to defend our@@ selves .
sure .
like the de@@ lor@@ mes family .
be careful , boss .
why ?
the mar@@ about said , " the time has come .
" take the fren@@ ch@@ man 's land , she@@ ep and wife .
everything ! "
then everyone chant@@ ed , " god is great . "
they 've been saying this for 20 years , but we 're still here .
boss !
the wor@@ kers !
- what about them ?
- they left .
- what do you mean ?
- the wor@@ kers , she@@ ep ,
- horses and mul@@ es , all gone !
- do you know where they went ?
no .
- they 're all gone ?
damn it !
they even took their shoes !
i thought they hurt their feet !
- they can sell them at the sou@@ k .
- and the cat@@ tle ?
- you think they st@@ ole all this ?
the had@@ j@@ out .
mr. said listened and che@@ ered on the mar@@ about .
- take this and guard the farm .
- where are you going , boss ?
to get a horse - and find them . - be careful , boss .
had@@ jou@@ ts are very mean .
- let me call the army .
- certainly not ! - there 'd be a massacre .
- had@@ jou@@ ts will but@@ cher you .
they know who i am .
thanks for the horse !
what if le@@ ila was right ?
i 'm a doctor , not a far@@ mer .
maybe i should give up and leave .
then i realized it 's too late .
we have to stay , change these people , give them la@@ ws , ci@@ vili@@ ze them .
i was crazy about alger@@ ia .
it 's such a beautiful country .
i come as a friend .
- i 'm not ar@@ med !
- where are my wor@@ kers ?
- they work for us now .
you work your own brothers like slav@@ es ?
pun@@ ishment for their betr@@ ay@@ al .
the had@@ jou@@ ts i met were ab@@ del@@ kader 's best warriors . now they 're just cut@@ throat mur@@ der@@ ous co@@ wards !
they viol@@ ated a saint 's grave ! that 's sac@@ ril@@ ege !
they were pun@@ ished .
it 's god 's law .
- pay !
- i have no money .
heard that ? they want your wife .
we 'll visit your wife . she 'll pay for you .
kill me now .
we 'll show her this and she 'll come get you .
she 'll bring the army .
you 'll all be shot !
a@@ icha ...
i read your articles and pam@@ ph@@ let on alger@@ ia .
let me say that i completely dis@@ agree with your arab@@ oph@@ ile views .
you 're ent@@ it@@ led to your opinion .
i suppose you 're an arab@@ op@@ ho@@ be ?
call it what you will .
as depart@@ mental head of the alger@@ ian government my views are not theo@@ retic@@ al , but based on real things .
i thought we were discus@@ sing people - and not things .
- what are your views ?
the cross and the cre@@ scent are ir@@ recon@@ cil@@ able .
christ@@ ians and muslim@@ s can@@ not live together unless one domin@@ ates the other .
- why should christ@@ ians domin@@ ate ?
- it 's the law of the jungle .
you 're shocked ?
this is how it 's been thro@@ ugh@@ out history .
we 're the masters of alger@@ ia .
why can 't the cross and the cre@@ scent get along ?
the arab@@ s have refused to cooper@@ ate these last 20 years .
they w@@ age wars on us , cut our sett@@ lers ' thro@@ ats , burn our far@@ ms , dream of throwing us in the sea .
it 's because we see them as the defe@@ ated and not as part@@ ners .
what if co@@ ss@@ acks or prus@@ si@@ ans still occu@@ pied paris ? if they had burned your family home in nor@@ mand@@ y , se@@ ized your land and destroy@@ ed your chur@@ ches ?
forgive me , general , but i refuse to continue to debate with someone who compar@@ es our tro@@ ops to co@@ ss@@ acks !
this is in@@ suff@@ er@@ able !
come , darling .
can you believe that fool ?
to think they 're considering him for the secre@@ tary general position in al@@ gi@@ ers .
he treated me like a " mou@@ kere . " i put him in his place .
you should have seen the look on his face !
you did well , bahia .
general fle@@ ury offered me an as@@ sign@@ ment in al@@ gi@@ ers .
my articles and my book are quite popular over there .
- say you 'll take me with you .
- of course i will .
and we 'll visit od@@ il@@ on .
i haven 't heard from him in over a year .
le@@ ila wrote me that she 's worried about him .
you smell nice .
do as i say .
- you were with those thie@@ ves ?
- when ab@@ del@@ kader sur@@ ren@@ dered , i took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart .
how is your son ?
- i 'm trying to make him a man .
- may allah watch over him .
ab@@ del@@ kader and i only wished to go to the mec@@ ca , but the french didn 't keep their word and kept him prison@@ er .
so i joined the had@@ j@@ out . you saw it :
lions became vul@@ tures . - mur@@ der@@ ers .
- it 's not their fault .
the french are stronger .
you fought vali@@ antly .
the time for peace has come .
i 'll speak to gover@@ nor rand@@ on on your be@@ half .
god willing .
he 's the only one i trust .
it 's up to him .
enough about god !
he hel@@ ps those who help themselves !
my mind 's made up . i 'm going to al@@ gi@@ ers .
you 're deser@@ ting , hubert .
far@@ ming is hard work ,
- but we can 't give up . - my wife was right .
we 're not made to live this way .
you 'll find someone else to le@@ ase the farm .
that 's not the problem .
span@@ i@@ ards can work it .
think it over .
need some help ?
boss , i want to go to al@@ gi@@ ers with you .
i can guard your house , take the children to school , - anything !
- of course .
- your wife will be thril@@ led .
- you think so ?
she cried a lot when i took her to bli@@ da .
you 're part of the family .
you 're like a mother and father to me .
i fell in love with the white city of al@@ gi@@ ers that em@@ brac@@ es the mediterran@@ ean shore .
le@@ ila had waited for me and for@@ given me .
she worked as a nurse , was radi@@ antly happy , had found her place in society .
i finally set up my own practice .
al@@ gi@@ ers 's european community was exp@@ and@@ ing by the day .
i had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a french province .
not for military men , but for sett@@ lers turning this place into a new country .
od@@ il@@ on !
how are you ?
let me introdu@@ ce our copy editor , benjamin ben@@ so@@ us@@ san , and jeanne , the " illu@@ stration " correspon@@ dent .
hello .
excuse me . what do you think of this ?
i went all out .
it 's 4 pages long .
there 's your bio@@ graphy , what happened to you , everything !
you 'll become a hero to the colon@@ y !
here 's your tale .
you 're very tal@@ ent@@ ed !
i said that before , haven 't i ?
we should team up .
i could sell you half my shar@@ es .
- i don 't have any money .
- same here !
buy them on credit .
- let 's shake on it .
- sol@@ d . i 'm for the sett@@ lers , now i know how they oper@@ ate .
you finally got it .
it 's all here in my editorial .
" paris 's indi@@ ffer@@ ence . " the army 's in@@ compet@@ ence and arro@@ gan@@ ce .
" nat@@ ive laz@@ iness . "
read the conclusion ! i showed rand@@ on what 's what !
" down with the sword . it 's time for civil power .
" alger@@ ia is french ! "
- want to show me around ?
- with pleasure .
children , did you know your father is a hero ?
it 's in all the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers .
- don 't ex@@ ag@@ gerate .
- i heard about it in school .
why are you a hero , father ?
did you kill a lot of arab@@ s ?
- no . why would you think that ?
- when we play cops and rob@@ bers , the rob@@ bers are always arab@@ s .
ridiculous !
i 'll have a word with your teacher !
they won 't let me be a cop .
- why not ?
- they say i 'm mixed .
what 's that ?
someone who 's half-@@ half .
half french and half ar@@ ab .
- am i half ar@@ ab ?
- i don 't wan@@ na be !
you 're not .
you 're a quar@@ ter kab@@ yle .
- pass me the jam .
- isn 't that the same ?
not at all !
kab@@ y@@ les are not arab@@ s .
so i can be a cop .
yes .
of course you can play cop , but you can 't kill anyone .
- got it ?
- hurry up , you 'll be late .
- bye .
- have a nice day .
make sure you pay attention .
- bye , swe@@ eti@@ e .
- do we understand each other ?
- yes .
- have a nice day .
everyone is talking about you .
i like it here .
i feel like i 'm in france .
- but with arab@@ s .
- we live separ@@ ately here .
i have to go .
general rand@@ on asked me to come see him .
see you tonight .
so , hubert , you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you 're a reti@@ red officer , aren 't you ?
- i am , general .
- and you write for this rag , run by rou@@ car@@ ies .
a com@@ mie !
we should have sent him to new cal@@ edonia .
- he 's a republic@@ an , general .
- a com@@ mie ! an anarch@@ ist !
he defen@@ ds mer@@ cen@@ aries , advent@@ ur@@ ers and depor@@ tees who come to alger@@ ia to explo@@ it nat@@ ive labor !
let me re@@ mind you , general , that the sett@@ lers are colon@@ iz@@ ing and far@@ ming this land - on be@@ half of france .
- land that the army con@@ quer@@ ed !
we 'll discus@@ s this some other time .
i asked you here because you 're familiar with the mit@@ id@@ ja .
i 'm worried . new in@@ cid@@ ents have been repor@@ ted .
mar@@ about si@@ di yac@@ ou@@ b trav@@ els the area and gets them all worked up .
it 's an epi@@ demi@@ c !
re@@ ports of so-@@ called mar@@ abou@@ ts all over the country , calling for " ji@@ had . "
- they have mon@@ keys and go@@ ats . - it 's an old tradition .
they capture the imagination of the nai@@ ve and ignor@@ ant who fall for their che@@ ap tr@@ icks .
- they 're il@@ lus@@ ion@@ ists .
- exactly .
- ever heard of robert hou@@ din ?
your mar@@ abou@@ ts couldn 't hold a cand@@ le to him .
- i asked paris to send him here .
- i fa@@ il to see the connection .
arab@@ s are a super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous people .
they 're amaz@@ ed by sle@@ ight of hand .
i 'll show them a better mag@@ ic@@ ian than all their mar@@ abou@@ ts .
robert hou@@ din !
general bu@@ ge@@ aud once tried to send them fal@@ se proph@@ ets .
they were all mur@@ dered .
this is different !
this one 's french !
i 'd bet you anything that he 'll amaz@@ e them !
he amaz@@ ed me , so ...
the arab@@ s want to see wonder@@ s , so i 'll show them wonder@@ s !
one last thing , i 'm told you 're friends with an auth@@ or called to@@ us@@ saint , a man turning paris up@@ side down , demand@@ ing that arab@@ s
- be considered our equ@@ als ?
- i am . he 's here , on a mission for general fle@@ ury .
i had to give him an office .
i 'm not sure what he 's up to , but i don 't like it , so i 'm having him followed .
try to get some information out of him and keep me ap@@ pri@@ z@@ ed .
want some wine , boss ?
ahmed , i told you to call him " sir . "
sorry .
want some wine , s@@ ire ?
- sir .
- no , i 'm fine , ya@@ oul@@ ed .
and stop calling him ya@@ oul@@ ed .
his name 's ahmed .
didn 't i tell you ?
i decided we should fren@@ chif@@ y our li@@ fest@@ yle .
i ordered restor@@ ation arm@@ chairs .
i like the sitting room the way it is .
that stuck@@ -up woman at the general 's asked if i was a moor !
that 's why . that 's not an insul@@ t .
you 're half span@@ ish , a quar@@ ter kab@@ yle and a quar@@ ter french .
and the end res@@ ult is not bad at all .
i 'm french !
i don 't want people thinking i 'm a " mou@@ kere ! "
did you know the to@@ us@@ saints were here ?
the moved into one of the best pal@@ aces in al@@ gi@@ ers .
i know . he 's important now .
he 's general fle@@ ury 's agent and spe@@ aks for paris@@ ian arab@@ oph@@ iles .
i saw bahia this afternoon .
she 's putting on air@@ s now that she 's lived in paris .
- sau@@ ce ?
- please .
she invit@@ ed us to dinner tomorrow night .
i 'm looking forward to seeing hel@@ ie .
- isn 't this a bit cold ?
- no .
sorry , but it is .
ya@@ oul@@ ed ?
ahmed .
ahmed !
could we have for@@ ks ?
i don 't eat with my hands anymore .
so ?
i don 't understand why you stopped writing me .
you let me down .
you 'd promised to ask your friends to help me .
- i 'm still waiting .
- sorry , it wasn 't easy with all these changes of regime : first a kingdom , then a republic , and now an empire .
- you don 't know how it is .
- i do .
jud@@ ging by your stri@@ pes , you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
what happened to you ?
you 've changed .
while you were having fun in paris , - i went through hell here !
- why did you become a sett@@ ler ?
that 's enough .
i 've heard enough .
go see how they live on the mit@@ id@@ ja !
i now understand what " bad sett@@ lers " are .
excuse me .
- how are your children ?
- well .
and yours ?
well .
i 'd like them to live here .
why ?
they 're lucky enough to study in france .
excuse me .
i 'd like them to know their hom@@ eland and to speak arab@@ ic .
what for ?
what 's important is that they speak french .
it 's their culture , their ro@@ ots .
i don 't want them to den@@ y their orig@@ ins , like others do .
is this why you still wear a " j@@ ell@@ aba " ?
i 'm proud to wear it .
and it will never go out of style .
it 's their damn religion that put@@ s them to sleep .
medieval fat@@ alism .
what are you doing to help them ?
tour@@ ing robert hou@@ din dis@@ gu@@ ised as a mar@@ about ?
you want them to stay ignor@@ ant so you can domin@@ ate them .
we have to defend our@@ selves .
your deser@@ tion polic@@ y would have us all leave within 5 years .
did you forget our dream of unit@@ ing the east and the west ?
only equ@@ ality and progress can give arab@@ s their dign@@ ity back .
they don 't want your progress .
ask our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian brothers . ask tal@@ ab@@ ot .
they 're sab@@ ot@@ ag@@ ing his rail@@ road .
to modern@@ ize the country , we need to impose our la@@ ws and our better institutions . it 's not only in our interest ,
- but in the@@ irs .
- am i really hearing this ?
you sound like those colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s i keep meeting here in al@@ gi@@ ers !
i found more support for alger@@ ians in paris !
it 's easy to be pro-@@ ar@@ ab when you live in paris .
no one is on your side here , not gover@@ nor , army or sett@@ lers .
you 've already lost the battle .
i 'll be frank .
your new@@ sp@@ aper is je@@ o@@ par@@ diz@@ ing our collaboration with arab@@ s .
this might res@@ ult in a war .
there 's nothing left to be said .
let 's go .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how sad .
they 're ho@@ pel@@ ess .
mis@@ fortune has made them bitter .
i , had@@ j ham@@ ou , give you my horse as well as this sword with which i 've always fought fair@@ ly .
my life is in your hands .
you can have my son as a symbol of my sin@@ cer@@ ity .
may god help you decide our fate .
as a show of faith , i 'll let you keep your sword and horse , but i 'll take care of your son .
he can serve france when he 's older .
go back to your people and live pe@@ ac@@ efully .
drum roll !
i 'll only use it to defend my new friends if they 're att@@ acked .
i 'll see to it that he goes to a good school , so he can follow in his father 's foot@@ steps .
france 's flag is wide and can shel@@ ter all those who se@@ ek refu@@ ge and protection .
i spent 20 years of my life fighting , killing and dest@@ ro@@ ying .
i will now devo@@ te myself to peace and re@@ building .
i could take care of him and his studies .
under one condition .
which is ?
that you let him be mus@@ lim .
i swear to your god and mine to do so .
i 'll care for him as if he were my own .
how long will that boy stay in our home ?
i don 't know .
it 'll depend on his studies .
he e@@ ats with his hands . he doesn 't know how to use a fork .
he 'll learn .
this is what we 're here for .
you treat that child better than your own .
- good night , father .
good night , mother .
- good night , mother .
- good night , si@@ di baba .
- good night .
you 're not his father .
he 's only repe@@ ating what he 's heard .
you 've got a new night@@ go@@ wn .
where did you get it ?
i got some proper clothes .
why do you always hide that you 're kin@@ d-@@ hear@@ ted ?
- i want to see father . - go on .
- stop touching my things !
don 't mind him . he 's just mean .
you can play with me .
a pearl .
- a chair .
- a table .
- a girl .
- a pearl .
not a pearl .
a girl .
" a girl . "
a boy .
" a boy . " a girl . a boy .
go to bed .
but say your pr@@ ay@@ ers first .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with the@@ e , bles@@ sed art th@@ ou am@@ ong@@ st women ...
i was a medical officer , he , an interpre@@ ter .
it was a myth@@ ical alger@@ ia .
wanting arab@@ s to ab@@ ide by french rules would be a mistake .
they 're our part@@ ners , ...
the doc is a sp@@ y .
watch his every move .
- bring me all his letters .
- i 'm in love .
she 's here to sp@@ y on you .
that 's what the arab@@ s do !
this is a war of conqu@@ est and ex@@ termin@@ ation of arab@@ s .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers even wrote that we 're the barbar@@ ians .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republic@@ an and pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
after having con@@ quer@@ ed this land in the name of france , you will now farm it . and make it your new home !
can 't the cross and the cre@@ scent get along ?
they have different custom@@ s and val@@ ues .
they 're sav@@ ages !
you 'll all be shot !
you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you write for this rag ?
you sound like those colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s i keep meeting here in al@@ gi@@ ers !
it 's easy to be pro-@@ ar@@ ab when you live in paris .
i never betr@@ ayed you .
no one must ever know .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
i couldn 't show my happiness .
i hope we won 't regret rais@@ ing this child as ours .
why would we ?
my son ais@@ sa looked so much like na@@ ou@@ el , whom i had loved so much .
what was in store for him ?
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 3 .
the ar@@ ab kingdom
you 're so handsome and strong , my son .
you 're the one who 's beautiful , mom .
- you are .
- no .
i 'm old now .
your father doesn 't look at me anymore .
- he took a new wife . very young .
- another one ?
since you joined the french , he took 2 w@@ ives to s@@ ire children .
i 'm not a good mare .
i only had one son .
you .
i think poly@@ gam@@ y is barbar@@ ic .
you sound like a fren@@ ch@@ man .
it 's the " ka@@ ida . " the proph@@ et had 9 w@@ ives .
- what 's the new wife 's name ?
- she 's from a noble clan .
she is je@@ alous of me .
wanted me sent to the kitchen .
no way !
you 're coming to al@@ gi@@ ers , to stay with me .
no !
be reas@@ su@@ red , son .
your father respec@@ ts and protec@@ ts me .
besides , i don 't want to be a bur@@ den on you .
it 's time for you to get married .
i chose a nice girl for you from a good family . very pretty and sweet .
six@@ teen . nice hips , not like me .
she 'll give you beautiful kids .
- no .
- you don 't want to get married ?
your brothers are already engag@@ ed , but your father won 't let them marry because you 're the el@@ dest .
i want to choose my own wife .
you love someone else .
yes .
a french woman ?
yes .
- who is she ?
- i can 't tell you .
not even to your mother ?
i don 't know if her parents will allow it .
- it 's because you 're an ar@@ ab .
- no .
it 's more complic@@ ated .
no , it isn 't .
be careful ais@@ sa .
the french are hypo@@ cr@@ ites .
they 're against poly@@ gam@@ y , but they all have mist@@ res@@ ses .
they won 't give you their daughter .
love can break all bar@@ riers .
you 're young .
time er@@ as@@ es all ... even love .
your old mother ... knows .
abdallah seems to be manag@@ ing well .
i 'm not used to it anymore .
you can study here .
i slowly built up a nice library .
i even found manus@@ crip@@ ts that belong@@ ed to emir ab@@ del@@ kader .
may god protect him in ex@@ ile .
france st@@ ole you from us , ais@@ sa .
you forgot that you gave me to france .
it made me into an officer .
it 's like a mother to me .
there are 2 france , ais@@ sa .
that 's what i learned .
in paris , france made you an officer and fre@@ ed ital@@ y . here , france ke@@ eps alger@@ ia under its yo@@ ke .
the gover@@ nor is se@@ iz@@ ing our land to give to the colon@@ ists .
what do they want ?
her@@ d us in the sahara ?
i 'm certain napoleon iii is against con@@ fin@@ ement .
five trib@@ al el@@ ders and i are to meet him in comp@@ ie@@ gne .
we 'll see if he 's on our side .
- we must trust him .
- may god hear you ... and inspire him truth and justice .
ais@@ sa was back .
what joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence , now a grown man covered in glory under the french bann@@ er .
- at mag@@ enta and sol@@ fer@@ ino ?
- yes .
- you lucky devil . - emile .
war is no joke , except for kings and emper@@ ors . victory in sol@@ fer@@ ino cost thous@@ ands of lives .
yes , but we saved the itali@@ ans from austri@@ an occupation .
what a beautiful uniform .
you look handsome .
- dinner is ready .
- let 's go .
tell us all about it .
to ais@@ sa .
i looked at ais@@ sa .
he was proof that one could be a good fren@@ ch@@ man and a good a mus@@ lim .
did he em@@ body the succes@@ s@@ ful union of the east and the west ?
i started to believe in it again .
i don 't like the way ais@@ sa looks at jeanne .
- going out ?
with those go@@ o go@@ o eyes of his .
- didn 't you notice ?
- no . why ?
- suppose he 's in love with her .
- what are you talking about ?
i hope we won 't regret rais@@ ing this child as ours .
on the contr@@ ary .
he 's the perfect ex@@ ample of integration .
- he 's like a fren@@ ch@@ man .
- perhaps . but he isn 't .
he is by the blood he spil@@ led , fighting for france .
that 's fine , but i don 't want him to touch my daughter .
don 't worry .
he 's staying in town and wants to be his own man .
i hope so .
i have something to tell you , jeanne .
i love war .
i discovered a new hom@@ eland :
in the army , bar@@ riers fall .
i 'm not a mus@@ lim among cathol@@ ics or an ar@@ ab among french .
i 'm a soldier among soldiers . all equ@@ al before death .
only one rule : courage .
- do you understand ?
- i don 't know . it 's a male world where women have no place .
i 'm bo@@ red , ais@@ sa .
i need to do something use@@ ful , excit@@ ing , unique .
sometimes i en@@ vy the fate of colon@@ ist women .
it 's dangerous but so excit@@ ing .
jeanne . will you marry me ?
of course .
when we were little , we said we 'd get married .
will your parents let their daughter marry a mus@@ lim ?
i don 't know about dad .
mother won 't .
but i don 't care .
- where is miss jeanne ?
- outside .
how are you feeling ?
well .
why ?
you 've been odd , lat@@ ely .
you can trust me .
among women , we can understand each other .
nothing is trou@@ bling me .
a mother feels such things .
you 're a big girl , jeanne .
it 's time to think about your future .
there 're many young offic@@ ers from good famili@@ es in al@@ gi@@ ers .
i 'll invite some for you to meet .
- i 'm not in a hurry to marry .
- then you 'll be an old ma@@ id .
mother !
what are you driving at ?
i don 't want you to fall for just anyone .
that 's all .
- that 's what it is . - yes .
that 's what it is .
you 've changed since ais@@ sa 's return .
- you have a soft spot for him .
- not a soft spot .
we 're in love .
we want to get married .
what ?
marry an ar@@ ab ?
a mus@@ lim ?
no way !
marriage is something serious .
you marry someone with the same religion and background .
i for@@ bid you to see this boy .
understood ?
i for@@ bid you .
understood ?
yes .
- i knew it .
i told you . - thank you .
and you thought they were like brother and sister .
i 'll call the police if he sets foot in here again .
what 's gotten into you ?
we raised him as one or ours .
unfortunately , yes .
anyway you always had a soft spot for him .
- i don 't want him to touch her .
he won 't have the chance anyway .
his regiment is leaving for france , then mexico .
- when ?
- i don 't know .
the emper@@ or wants maximilian of austria in mexico .
very good .
how can you say that .
it 's war over there .
just as well .
maybe he 'll get killed .
is jeanne there ?
get out !
beat it !
never set foot in this house !
go away !
- you had no right to stop him .
- you do what you 're told .
you can 't stop me .
i 'll leave , come what may .
i 'll join him , become a mus@@ lim if need be .
- go to your room !
- don 't touch me !
don 't you ever , again .
- what are you doing here ?
- i escaped from home .
- are you out of your mind ?
- i came to say goodbye .
- what are you doing ?
- i want to be yours .
i can 't believe it !
look at this !
see the news ?
your circum@@ cis@@ ed pal is taking 5 el@@ ders to see the emper@@ or .
- did you know ?
- no .
- we 're not close anymore .
- they are plo@@ t@@ ting in comp@@ ie@@ gne , with general fle@@ ury and the saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans .
- what do they want ?
- arab@@ ize us .
said , come with me .
take care of yourself !
don 't worry .
this trip is very important for me .
the emper@@ or has decided .
he read my books .
he plans a new alger@@ ia polic@@ y , my polic@@ y .
can you understand that ?
- you 'll see the kids at least . - of course .
i 'll write every day and tell you what 's happening .
" dear bahia , you can 't imagine how lav@@ ish@@ ly
" the emper@@ or received our ar@@ ab friends at comp@@ ie@@ gne . "
" everything is so wonderful .
" the emper@@ or held long tal@@ ks with the el@@ ders .
" he promised complete equ@@ ality between europe@@ ans and arab@@ s .
" ' that 's but fair , honor@@ able and right , ' he told them . " who were de@@ ligh@@ ted , you can imagine .
" it 's truly a revolution . "
" the nat@@ ive chie@@ fs gave the emper@@ or a black stal@@ lion , " a magn@@ ific@@ ent off@@ spring of the famous go@@ dol@@ ph@@ in arab@@ ian , " father of all thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ bre@@ ds .
" his majest@@ y has a special place for it .
" ' we 'll be able to com@@ pete with the british , ' gen@@ . fle@@ ury said .
" her majest@@ y the em@@ press and the imperial prince " showed our friends consider@@ ation and appreci@@ ation .
" the emper@@ or recognized ais@@ sa , whom he decor@@ ated at mag@@ enta . " he also introduc@@ ed him to the em@@ press .
" his father , had@@ j ham@@ ou , was filled with pride .
" finally , his majest@@ y did me the honor
" to explain in detail his project to our friends " to turn alger@@ ia into an ar@@ ab kingdom . "
dear friends , here 's the man whose works have insp@@ i@@ red the emper@@ or 's polic@@ y .
no one can better explain it to you .
i 'll give him the floor .
the emper@@ or asked me to tell you that we didn 't come to alger@@ ia to op@@ press or pl@@ under , but to bring you the bles@@ s@@ ings of civiliz@@ ation .
he wants to make alger@@ ia an ar@@ ab kingdom .
hen@@ ce@@ forth , he 'll protect you , as he does the french .
he is both emper@@ or of the french and king of the arab@@ s .
- in practice , what does it mean ?
- fir@@ st@@ ly ... the emper@@ or will end the con@@ fin@@ ement polic@@ y .
your title to tradition@@ al trib@@ al lands will be recognized .
no more desp@@ oli@@ ation .
- will land be ours ?
- it will bel@@ ong to the trib@@ es .
later , everyone will have a share .
secon@@ dly ... following the proclam@@ ation of full europe@@ an-@@ ar@@ ab equ@@ ality , the emper@@ or shall grant french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship to je@@ ws and arab@@ s who so desire .
we know france br@@ ings progress and we are grateful .
but we 'd rather live according to our own la@@ ws and custom@@ s .
for us muslim@@ s , religion rules everything .
you know that .
the kor@@ an is our civil code , our book of science and medicine , the word of god .
i assure you , all your views will be taken into account .
let us begin .
what 's your impression ?
they are de@@ ligh@@ ted by their stay .
they were also char@@ med by his majest@@ y .
i think they 'll agree with the ar@@ ab kingdom model , except for si kad@@ our , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
we have to handle him carefully .
he 's very influ@@ enti@@ al in kab@@ y@@ lia .
in any event , it 's imper@@ ative for his majest@@ y to come to alger@@ ia to laun@@ ch his polic@@ y .
it will provo@@ ke colon@@ ist and military opposition .
he 'll come .
it 's only a question of tim@@ ing .
if pel@@ is@@ sier doesn 't like it , we 'll re@@ place him .
there you are .
tal@@ ab@@ ot has been waiting for you for half an hour .
- paul@@ in , i 'm happy to see you .
- od@@ il@@ on .
- what are you doing in al@@ gi@@ ers ?
- big news , old pal .
next week , we 'll be lay@@ ing down the last rail@@ road track . we 're also inaugur@@ ating the new bli@@ da station .
mar@@ sha@@ l pel@@ is@@ sier ...
everyone will be there .
i hope you 'll write a nice article .
is the paper yours ?
i bought 50 % from rou@@ car@@ ies , but it 's not doing well .
no .
i have to meet pel@@ is@@ sier .
i gave rou@@ car@@ ies all the details .
- see you later at the cafe .
- agreed .
is mr. tal@@ ab@@ ot a saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian ?
i heard you were too .
does this sec@@ t still ex@@ ist ?
they 're scat@@ tered , but still have influence at the court , among university students and bank@@ ers .
here 's the article . lat@@ ely , they 've become like the fre@@ em@@ as@@ ons .
what do they want ?
the uto@@ pi@@ ans like to@@ us@@ saint believe in santa cl@@ aus .
the others believe in progress , thinking that with money , fac@@ tor@@ ies , mines and rail@@ roads , they can sol@@ ve everything .
the parado@@ x is that they began as soci@@ alist@@ s , and now they 're big cap@@ itali@@ sts .
i saw hel@@ ie yesterday .
we spoke about you and old times .
it seems you had a falling out ?
we have nothing to say to each other .
he 's gen@@ . fle@@ ury 's man . he heads the pro-@@ ar@@ ab camp that wants to sell out alger@@ ia .
we dis@@ agree about the future of this country .
you 're both wrong .
hel@@ ie thinks that the french and arab@@ s can live as equ@@ als .
you want to turn them into fren@@ ch@@ men .
that 's an il@@ lusion .
and you ?
what 's your solution ? i ... build .
i build rail@@ roads and roads , dig the ground , plant trees .
i re@@ present progress , a sort of char@@ ity .
i deal with reality , not dreams .
do you know what arab@@ s say about your rail@@ road ?
" al-@@ rab@@ at she@@ it@@ an , " the devil 's car@@ t .
i 'm hungry .
let 's have lunch .
good piece , benjamin !
you 'll do the next on the army 's anti-@@ con@@ fin@@ ement action .
- look !
nice lay@@ out .
- yes .
boy , come here .
it 's time i tell him .
i have bad news .
- i can guess .
- i can 't pay you .
you haven 't paid him in 2 months .
it 's not my fault if we don 't have money .
half the colon@@ ists are span@@ ish and can 't read french .
- i got an idea .
- really ?
struck gold ?
- maybe .
- serious ?
- where ?
- here in al@@ gi@@ ers . - what is it ?
- my dad 's pock@@ ets .
we 're always ready to help our french friends .
from the start of conqu@@ est we offered france our services .
we know the tur@@ ks and arab@@ s well , mr. hubert .
we 've de@@ alt with them for 2 centur@@ ies , since my anc@@ est@@ ors came from leg@@ horn to trade between barbar@@ y coast pirates and itali@@ an mer@@ ch@@ ants .
please , sit down .
we know your father advis@@ es gen@@ . bu@@ ge@@ aud on ar@@ ab affa@@ irs .
benjamin told me about your paper 's financial diffic@@ ulti@@ es .
that shouldn 't be a problem . my el@@ dest son david , who runs our bank , can help you .
did you hear me ?
with a special rate for friends .
thank you very much . let me also say how much we appreciate benjamin 's intelligence , skil@@ ls and tal@@ ents .
yes , benjamin .
i sent him to law school in montpellier . it cost a bun@@ dle , but we wanted him to be our law@@ yer .
but in france , he caught the polit@@ ical bug .
polit@@ ics se@@ als the fate of nations .
it 's very important .
trade is saf@@ er .
business is business , whoever is in power .
since your paper de@@ als with polit@@ ics , i 've a favor to ask .
please , tell me .
as head of the je@@ wish council , i 'm host to a french member of par@@ li@@ ament who is concerned about our small community . his name is adol@@ phe cre@@ mieux .
i hope he gets french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship for alger@@ ian je@@ ws .
i thought you weren 't interested in polit@@ ics .
it 's , let 's say , about religion .
we 'll be glad to interview him .
tell him to come to the paper .
thank you .
actually , thank you for what you 're doing for the paper .
it 's for a good cause , that of a french alger@@ ia where je@@ ws will play an important role .
since that is the case , could you ar@@ range a meeting between myself as head of the je@@ wish council , and the gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general ?
the army and i aren 't ...
you can see to it with my son daniel .
perhaps .
- see you tomorrow ... 8 am ?
- yes .
bahia ?
- had a good trip ?
- a bit long .
- i missed you .
- you too . - come !
- you 're still as beautiful .
tell me about the kids .
they 're well .
they send their love and miss you .
ahmed got his ph@@ .@@ d. in law with hon@@ ors .
good !
now he can practice in al@@ gi@@ ers .
- i 'm not sure he wants to .
- you 'll get upset .
- tell me !
he thinks he won 't make it in al@@ gi@@ ers .
he 's decided to stay in paris and changed his name .
- he now calls himself ame@@ dee .
- my son ahmed ?
don 't be upset !
i don 't like it , but i can understand him .
in paris , an ar@@ ab name st@@ icks out like a tur@@ ban .
many je@@ ws and pol@@ es took french names .
he won 't be the first .
then , why aren 't french taking ar@@ ab names here ?
it 's a religi@@ ous thing .
the french take saints ' names .
- i won 't have it .
- bahia !
i 'll write him what i think .
calm down .
things will change .
ahmed might too .
the emper@@ or accepted our pro@@ pos@@ als .
alger@@ ia will be an ar@@ ab kingdom with equ@@ al cit@@ iz@@ ens .
it will be a tou@@ gh sell .
everyone is against you .
- you must be hungry .
- a bit .
mar@@ sha@@ l pel@@ is@@ sier will see you .
- some port as you wait ?
- no , thanks .
i don 't drink .
a ci@@ gar ?
i don 't smoke .
besides , it 's ram@@ adan .
sorry !
i forgot .
the gover@@ nor is in a fou@@ l mood .
he got orders from paris , he doesn 't like .
i think i know what they are .
so you 're here .
did you put all this non@@ sense in his majest@@ y 's head ?
my respec@@ ts , mar@@ sha@@ l .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
don 't be so co@@ y !
this letter of instruc@@ tions from his majest@@ y ,
which he person@@ ally signed .
it tal@@ ks about the end of the con@@ fin@@ ement polic@@ y , about the ar@@ ab kingdom ,
and arab@@ -@@ european equ@@ ality .
did you put him up to it ?
it 's full of your books ' sub@@ ver@@ sive language ... and that of your friends , fle@@ ury , david ...
you flat@@ ter me thinking i have such influence on his majest@@ y .
no doub@@ let@@ al@@ k .
hear this , little fellow !
i was on the beach when we landed .
i didn 't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the arab@@ s who 'll mess it up .
i won 't ever accept that !
do you hear me ?
ever !
may i re@@ mind you , sir . the country belong@@ s to the arab@@ s .
no more .
we took it with our blood .
and especially with the@@ irs .
listen , to@@ us@@ saint !
we aren 't dre@@ amer@@ s , vision@@ aries .
we build .
we 're turning alger@@ ia into a modern country bringing comfort to the colon@@ ists and progress to the nat@@ ives .
there is no other vi@@ able plan .
all else is id@@ le talk for frustr@@ ated intellectu@@ als a bit like you .
you won 't build anything without the alger@@ ians .
to@@ us@@ saint ...
you might be the smar@@ test , but i war@@ n you ... i shall stop you .
god be my wit@@ ness ! i 'm the strong@@ est .
i too have connec@@ tions in the court .
perhaps you forget that my wife is the em@@ press ' cousin .
- may i go , mar@@ sha@@ l ?
- get out !
and don 't get in my way or you 'll regret it .
my respec@@ ts , mar@@ sha@@ l .
what arro@@ gan@@ ce !
i asked the emper@@ or to re@@ move this good@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ nothing .
he 's general fle@@ ury 's man and he 's backed by the emper@@ or .
by jo@@ ve , we 'll see who 's the strong@@ est .
keep your smooth talk for paris .
when we came here , there was nothing but desert , sw@@ amp@@ s , f@@ lies and d@@ warf palms .
one third of us died of chol@@ era .
one third gave up and rent@@ ed the land to the arab@@ s .
we are the last third .
we survi@@ ved mas@@ sac@@ res , disease , dro@@ ught , gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers .
we won 't give in to your ar@@ ab kingdom .
listen ! why end con@@ fin@@ ement ?
alger@@ ia has 3.5 million people . it can feed 20 .
we have 12 million hectar@@ es of un@@ cultiv@@ ated land . and you want to stop colon@@ iz@@ ation .
thous@@ ands of colon@@ ists can come .
why leave good land to the arab@@ s ?
either their her@@ ds destroy it , or they badly farm it .
- we produce 6 times they do .
- he 's right .
it 's our land .
we created a new france here .
friends , the land belong@@ s to the nat@@ ives , the colon@@ ists and the army .
the emper@@ or declar@@ ed it an ar@@ ab kingdom , a european colon@@ y and a military camp .
ar@@ rant non@@ sense .
it 's crystal clear to me .
first , we 're not your friends , to@@ us@@ saint . rul@@ ing means cho@@ os@@ ing .
it 's either us or them .
tell your emper@@ or that no one will throw us out .
this is our home .
our enem@@ ies want to give power to the arab@@ s .
if they win , that 'll tol@@ l the bell for us .
- do you want to become ar@@ ab ?
we 'll remain french . we won 't bow to napoleon the pun@@ y ... king of the arab@@ s !
we are now 200,000 europe@@ ans .
we can 't be dis@@ missed .
we 've ral@@ lied the colon@@ ists , and all true republic@@ ans :
pr@@ inter@@ s , mas@@ ons , mer@@ ch@@ ants , and architec@@ ts .
- are the je@@ ws with us ?
- of course . they might not dare come out , but i 'm here .
we 'll mobili@@ ze the women and demonstr@@ ate with you .
down with the emper@@ or !
long live the republic !
we had a fe@@ ver@@ ish month .
al@@ gi@@ ers was under siege . every day , people heard our call . women too .
- french alger@@ ia !
french alger@@ ia ! - present arms !
get ready !
let us through .
we 're going to the government house .
- the street is closed .
- let us through !
a@@ im !
- forward !
- french alger@@ ia !
take it easy !
i 'm not un@@ happy about the protest@@ s .
they show paris the fut@@ il@@ ity of its abandon@@ ment polic@@ y .
even women are getting into the act .
that 's too much .
these people are ho@@ the@@ ads a bit quick@@ -@@ temper@@ ed , but they cool down as quickly .
don 't forget !
we 're south of marseille .
anyway , make sure the tro@@ ops aren 't trig@@ ger@@ -@@ happy .
break some skul@@ ls if you must , but no fire .
that 's an order .
i don 't want any violence .
understood ?
no more violence .
it cool@@ ed down after a month .
mar@@ . pel@@ is@@ sier died from p@@ neum@@ onia . the ar@@ ab kingdom polic@@ y had its first set@@ back .
neither je@@ ws nor arab@@ s wanted to give up their special status in exchange for french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship .
only 200 arab@@ s out of 3 million app@@ lied for it . ais@@ sa was one of them and had his own reasons .
- thanks but i don 't drink .
- of course .
i came to ask you for jeanne 's hand , offici@@ ally .
my regiment leaves for mexico and we would like to be engag@@ ed before i leave .
ais@@ sa . you and jeanne can@@ not marry .
why ?
you 're too young , practically brother and sister .
a kab@@ yle pro@@ ver@@ b says , " marry within your tri@@ be ,
" within your village , and if possible , within your family . "
you bel@@ ong to different worl@@ ds .
what ?
i 'm french now .
yes , but you 're also mus@@ lim .
do you know the obst@@ acles you 'll be facing ?
jeanne will want a church wedding .
what will your family say ?
- there 're other mixed cou@@ ples .
- they 're the exception .
your friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint married a mus@@ lim woman .
yes , but he conver@@ ted , and now stands dis@@ ow@@ ned by his family .
listen !
let 's not beat around the bush . is it yes or no ?
ais@@ sa . i 'd like to say yes but it 's impossible .
believe me .
trust me .
it 's no , then .
what if we elop@@ ed without your per@@ mission ?
i for@@ bid you .
i get it .
my ar@@ ab blood was accep@@ table on the battle@@ field .
in paris , they saw fit to grant me french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship .
but they forgot to tell me it was a second class pas@@ sport , because here in al@@ gi@@ ers , i 'm always an out@@ si@@ der , a nat@@ ive .
even for you .
it 's all clear now .
i 'll wait for you .
when you return , i 'll be of age .
i 'll leave home .
we 'll marry and live in france .
we still have to wait .
i 'll wait for as long as it takes .
napoleon iii came to alger@@ ia twice to pro@@ claim himself king of the arab@@ s .
he was de@@ ligh@@ ted .
he ate o@@ str@@ ich eg@@ gs , ro@@ ast@@ ed gaz@@ elle and lion meat .
everywhere , huge ar@@ ab crow@@ ds che@@ ered him .
our paper had to con@@ cede his great succes@@ s , organiz@@ ed , it must be said , by the ar@@ ab office .
hel@@ ie acted as his interpre@@ ter thro@@ ugh@@ out his stay .
it was his hour of glory .
he thought he 'd seen the dawn of the ar@@ ab kingdom . history decided otherwise .
look at this !
four years of dro@@ ught , fam@@ ine , chol@@ era , and gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers .
all at once in just 4 years .
look !
they 're eating grass , ro@@ ots and even leaves .
people are dropping like f@@ lies from hunger and chol@@ era .
where are the french doc@@ tors ?
chol@@ era isn 't rac@@ ist . fren@@ ch@@ men have died from it too .
even bu@@ ge@@ aud died from it in paris .
did you see how the pe@@ as@@ ant treated me ?
when you privat@@ ized collec@@ tive land , you broke up the tri@@ be ,
it 's the price of progress and of a fa@@ i@@ rer , modern society .
do you know what they did with the ar@@ id land you gave them ?
they sol@@ d it to the colon@@ ists for a pit@@ tan@@ ce .
people here are super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous .
they 're saying the ar@@ ab kingdom has the evil eye .
i 'm sorry , but all you 've done for us is turning against us .
all the same , you can 't blame us for dro@@ ught , gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers , and disease .
bad luck ho@@ unds us .
people say it 's god 's ven@@ ge@@ ance because we didn 't defend our land against the in@@ fi@@ del@@ s .
tell the gover@@ nor that if france does nothing , there 'll be war .
- war@@ n him .
- i will .
tell him that i lost a son ... to chol@@ era , and that my young@@ est might go into the mountains .
- you know what that means ?
- how is she ?
- it 's chol@@ era .
quick . she 's being waiting for you for 2 days .
my son ... apple of my eye .
- you came to say far@@ e@@ well .
- i 'm here .
you 'll pull through .
it 's too late .
god p@@ icks the hour and mine has come .
i 've a secret to tell you .
a secret ?
yes , ais@@ sa . one that i 've carried in my heart since you were born .
od@@ il@@ on is your father .
you must@@ n 't marry jeanne .
forgive me , ais@@ sa !
i mixed in@@ fi@@ del blood ... with that of the true warriors of the faith .
i was young , a har@@ em slave .
during the taf@@ na peace ,
od@@ il@@ on was ab@@ del@@ kader 's doctor .
you were born after that .
had@@ j ham@@ ou raised you . he taught you to walk , to ride a horse , and to use a sword and rif@@ le .
he taught you right from wrong , and courage .
he taught you the true religion .
he 's your father too .
stay with me !
stay !
i had made a promise .
i will always be fond of jeanne .
promise me never to tell her .
i promise .
if it does , i 'll fight by your side .
you can 't , ais@@ sa .
that 'd give you away .
have you for@@ sak@@ en your religion ?
i haven 't .
one day , france will allow its cit@@ iz@@ ens to be cathol@@ ic , je@@ wish or mus@@ lim .
france ... maybe .
but we won 't here , son , not on mus@@ lim so@@ il .
you 're french now .
you must leave and ful@@ fill your destiny .
i am french .
but my heart will forever be in alger@@ ia .
you 're hiding something .
what 's going on ?
is it another woman ?
is that it ?
be honest .
i 'm getting married .
what ?
my mother has chosen my future wife .
i can@@ not refuse .
it 's tradition , you see .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't care .
what 'll you do , all alone in paris ?
where will you stay ?
with aunt ines .
i 'll take a job as a nurse .
i 'll treat the wo@@ unded on the front .
i 'll defend france .
you 're lying .
you want to go with him .
you want to be with your ar@@ ab !
throwing yourself at him like that !
how dare you ?
look at yourself .
a kab@@ yle rap@@ ed your grandmother !
you 're an ar@@ ab too !
the bad arab@@ s like rap@@ ing women like you !
jeanne ...
our ar@@ mi@@ es are getting defe@@ ated everywhere :
wis@@ sem@@ bourg , reich@@ sho@@ ff@@ en-@@ fro@@ esch@@ wil@@ ler ...
what a dis@@ grace !
what posses@@ sed the emper@@ or to w@@ age war on prussia ?
bismarck was waiting for it .
new head@@ line !
the emper@@ or was cap@@ tured and ab@@ di@@ cated .
gamb@@ etta declar@@ ed a new republic .
a new republic , my friends !
follow me !
said ? i couldn 't believe it .
the emper@@ or had been cap@@ tured .
they 'd declar@@ ed a new republic .
my old dream had finally come true !
i 'm the lieutenant commander !
you should leave before my friends get here .
listen to them . they 're jubil@@ ant .
don 't be a hero , it 's best you fle@@ e .
where 's to@@ us@@ saint ?
where 's that sly fox ?
van@@ ished .
we 'll get him so@@ oner or later .
while the french are fighting each other ,
- let 's throw them into the sea .
we must save the ar@@ ab kingdom .
they say they 're republic@@ ans , but you know them .
they 're colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s , arab@@ op@@ ho@@ bes ...
let 's ro@@ use the trib@@ es and drive the french out !
- co@@ wards !
- listen to me !
we 've talked enough .
i 'll ro@@ use my tro@@ ops and fight !
come with me to oran , bahia .
you can 't stay in al@@ gi@@ ers .
bahia ...
i beg you ...
do this for me .
it 's too dangerous here .
i 'll try to go to paris on my own .
meet me there .
i love you .
the french government has f@@ led to tours .
by god , france is collap@@ sing !
we should declare indepen@@ dence .
send us gar@@ i@@ bal@@ di and alger@@ ia will take care of itself , just like ital@@ y .
you want us to fight 3 million arab@@ s all by our@@ selves ?
- what are the other wi@@ res ?
- nothing important .
say , what do you think of ...
what 's wrong ?
" on the front , the incredi@@ ble bra@@ very " of the ' chas@@ seurs d '@@ afrique , ' alger@@ ian soldiers and z@@ ou@@ aves ,
" cost them de@@ arly .
" the second ' tur@@ cos ' was bled dry .
" its offic@@ ers were killed in action . "
shit .
the second " tur@@ cos ... " that 's ais@@ sa 's regiment !
friends ...
military rule is over .
alger@@ ia has been split into 3 depart@@ ments gover@@ ned by french law .
the depart@@ ments will be run by a prefec@@ t and by members of par@@ li@@ ament .
the gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general must now be a ci@@ vili@@ an , under the minist@@ ry of the interior .
we 've won , my friends !
alger@@ ia is both ci@@ vili@@ an and french !
a french alger@@ ia !
- long live french alger@@ ia !
- wait . sett@@ le down . there 's more .
the 33@@ ,000 alger@@ ian je@@ ws are now automat@@ ically french .
- will we be allowed to vote ?
- of course .
- what about the arab@@ s ?
- not for now . ph@@ ew !
my heart stopped .
shut up !
thous@@ ands of " tur@@ cos " and z@@ ou@@ aves died on the battle@@ field . they vo@@ ted with their blood .
a minute of silence for our mus@@ lim brothers who died for france .
why did you keep that from me ?
i had made a promise .
how could you keep such a secret to yourself this long ?
" dear father , " you reading this letter means i was killed in action . "
" don 't cry .
" i 'll glad@@ ly give france the life you 've given me " that has nothing left in store for me .
" i will finally rest in peace " under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eye of the 2 gods who rul@@ ed " over my life and death . "
" the al@@ migh@@ ty god of the arab@@ s , who control@@ s good and evil " and the mer@@ ci@@ ful christian god " who can forgive every sin . "
" i 'm writing you to re@@ mind you of your promise . "
" jeanne ... " must never find out . "
" never . "
" far@@ e@@ well .
" your son , ais@@ sa . "
what happened ?
why did he rej@@ ect me ?
hey ar@@ ab !
stay where you are !
don 't move , ar@@ ab !
- yes ?
- open up !
i didn 't know where else to go .
come in .
oh , it 's you .
where 's bahia ?
she went to oran with her father .
why didn 't you take her with you ?
i 'd have looked after her .
have you e@@ aten ?
no .
i 'm not hungry .
i 'll go make your bed .
you can 't stay in alger@@ ia .
they 'll kill you .
you can spend the night here . tomorrow , i 'll put you on a boat to sp@@ ain .
i paid half already .
give them the rest when you arrive .
this is a saf@@ e-@@ conduc@@ t .
just in case .
and a pist@@ ol .
it could come in hand@@ y .
thank you .
- what a beautiful country .
- our country .
- what happened to us , od@@ il@@ on ?
- life .
do you remember men@@ il@@ mon@@ tant ?
unit@@ ing the east and the west ?
why did you for@@ sake our ide@@ als ?
they were uto@@ pi@@ an .
the ar@@ ab kingdom is not uto@@ pi@@ an .
just the opposite . it 's re@@ alist@@ ic .
you 'll see it too one day .
why do you force your ide@@ als on me ?
mine are as good as yours .
i want this land to become a part of france , of republic@@ an france . freedom , equ@@ ality , frat@@ ern@@ ity .
freedom ? or the right for the strong to op@@ press the weak !
not neces@@ sar@@ ily .
republic@@ an education will turn these arab@@ s into good french cit@@ iz@@ ens .
it 'll take time , but i 'm opti@@ mist@@ ic .
they should become good alger@@ ian cit@@ iz@@ ens , instead !
you 're bound to fa@@ il !
the future will decide .
- god will decide .
what happened to to@@ us@@ saint ?
i never saw him again .
i 'm told he went back to alger@@ ia .
how come ?
he followed his own path , alone , which doesn 't surprise me .
you never saw him again ?
wasn 't he a friend ?
you see , we never par@@ ted ways .
you know , we need uto@@ pi@@ ans , dre@@ amer@@ s .
the world couldn 't ex@@ ist without them .
excuse me , i must go now .
it 's rather cold in here , wouldn 't you agree ?
it is .
after a while , the cold gets to you .
it 's just awful .
trans@@ lation :
previ@@ ously on childr@@ ens hospital ... 18 , 19 , 20 .
ready or not , here i come .
got@@ cha !
a@@ ah !

syn@@ c correc@@ tions by dw@@ igt
looks like somebody 's having a bad head day .
detective chance brig@@ gs , you old bu@@ cket of shr@@ im@@ ps .
what 's my old partner doing here ?
the yo@@ oz@@ h .
what 's with the water coming out of the face ?
he was my ex-@@ boyfriend .
i loved his head . the vic@@ tim had his head ripped clean off .
look familiar to you , maestro ?
looks an awful lot like that ras@@ h of mur@@ ders 15 years ago .
those were all boy@@ friends of yours , too , right , cat ?
it 's almost enough to make a girl stop dating .
or only date guys you want to see dead .
can you find the person who did this ?
not on my own . i 'm gon@@ na need some help from my old partner .
i haven 't been a cop for a long time .
it 's in your blood , your g@@ lands .
i could smell it in you on our first day working together .
_
detective brig@@ gs ?
i 'm your new partner , owen maestro .
ugh !
ro@@ o@@ kie move , maestro . never let your guard down like that .
but section 19 / a of the rule book says --
the rule book 's never been out on the streets .
sometimes , you got to bend the rules .
su@@ cker punch !
su@@ cker punch ! but that 's not what we learned at the academy .
the academy doesn 't know crap .
just ask the rule book . release .
so , what 's our as@@ sign@@ ment ?
the childr@@ ens hospital mur@@ ders .
they just found a four@@ th vic@@ tim de@@ capit@@ ated like the others .
four de@@ capit@@ ations , huh ?
these victi@@ ms sound like the beatles of de@@ capit@@ ations .
the fa@@ b four -- without heads .
i mean i 've heard of " help , " but this is ridiculous .
mo@@ p to@@ ps ? how about no to@@ ps ?
you know that song " come together " ?
well , this is like " come apart . "
you know .
" i want to hold my head . "
... " on , so it doesn 't get cut off . "
this band is not gon@@ na have the talking heads for an opening act .
- let 's go .
which one of you is in charge ?
well , that couldn 't be me .
the only thing i 'm in charge of is this .
hey , uh , boss !
- these guys want to talk to you .
- okay . okay , i 'll talk to you later .
hi . i 'm brad len@@ dr@@ icks .
i 'm the head param@@ edi@@ c .
what do you want ?
it 's about the recent kil@@ lings at the hospital .
you mean the ones due to the ser@@ ial killer or medical neg@@ li@@ gence ?
let 's save the s@@ nap@@ s for " yo mtv s@@ nap@@ s . "
word is the param@@ edi@@ cs are the eyes and ears of the hospital .
brad can 't help you .
no , he 's always been myster@@ iously missing whenever a murder happened .
if you 'll excuse me , i have to go stand over there .
if you ask me , brad 's glad all those guys got off@@ ed .
see , he 's been in love with cat for years , but she refus@@ es to go out with him .
and now he 's got a clear playing field .
a clearly stat@@ ed motive .
still , we need some solid evidence .
all we have on the guy is what this bald as@@ sh@@ ole told us .
no off@@ ense -- i 'm sure you have some really great qualit@@ ies , too .
i 'm just going off of first impres@@ sions .
you know , i 've always wanted to be a doctor .
ever since i gradu@@ ated medical school .
so , did you ever become a doctor ?
yeah . i 've been a doctor for 15 years .
oh , yeah , right .
that is not good enough , okay ?
i want these ti@@ res to be white !
there 's more ur@@ ine where this came from .
there 's that param@@ edi@@ c .
how do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago ?
chet mand@@ van@@ te@@ us@@ sen ?
just do it better next time .
we want to talk to you about the murder of cat 's most recent boyfriend .
you 've done pretty well for yourself , haven 't you , mand@@ van@@ te@@ us@@ sen ?
you 're head param@@ edi@@ c now , your own ambul@@ ance , your own assistant .
maybe . doesn 't mean i killed cat 's boyfriend .
it could have been any@@ body .
what about former secre@@ tary of state con@@ dol@@ e@@ ez@@ za rice ?
okay . not her .
one down .
about 6 bil@@ lion to go .
we need the personnel records on everyone who 's worked here in the past 15 years .
i 'm sorry .
any files over 14 years old are conver@@ ted into micro@@ film and then shi@@ pped to our stor@@ age facil@@ ity in the deep south where they are then destroy@@ ed .
i wish i could be more hel@@ p@@ ful .
_
turn up anything ?
and lots of it .
just like we found at each of the other murder scenes .
yeah , and according to the lab , all the sem@@ en samp@@ les came from the same person , probably male .
i would say definitely male .
my guess is len@@ dr@@ icks , but we can 't know without a samp@@ le of his sem@@ en .
detective ?
i 'm on it .
i like your hair@@ cut .
thank you .
got it .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
this is a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge dev@@ ice used to identi@@ fy dna .
welcome to the future , my friend .
and now i 'll just call the lab .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
it 's the new motor@@ ola clam@@ shell , brig@@ gs .
you never seen a cell@@ phone ?
sure , but if i need to call someone , i 'll use a pay phone .
this is more than just a phone , partner .
look -- time and date .
good god .
i guess it is a time and date machine .
we got a match .
- chet , are you cle@@ aning that gur@@ ney ?
- yes , sir ! hold it right there .
you 're under ar@@ rest for the murder of --
w@@ hoa ! i want to talk to a law@@ yer !
the only law@@ yer you 'll be talking to is one ap@@ pointed to you by the court .
vet@@ eran move , maestro .
wrong seat .
could you get in the back , please ?
oh . there we go .
watch your head .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , girls .
zoe , thank you so much for your note .
that was so sweet .
len@@ dr@@ icks .
last time we saw you , you were a man .
what ?
shut up !
i made a deal with the district at@@ tor@@ ney to be sent to the women 's prison --
better food , less athle@@ te 's foot , and the sex is amazing .
what ? anything goes !
we think your old assistant chet may be co@@ py@@ cat@@ ting you .
i didn 't do it in the first place .
wait . what ?
your sem@@ en was found at every crime scene .
sem@@ en , sem@@ en , sem@@ en , sem@@ en !
i used to ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ e in the clo@@ sets at work .
is that a crime ?
in iraq , yes , and also here .
okay , all i ask is that when you find this guy , you clear my name .
except for the ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ ing part .
i did do that , and i want that credit .
look at us , huh ?
working a case , just like the first day we met .
actually ... it 's time i told you about the real first day we met .
what 's happening ?
the year was 1992 .
during my junior year at ober@@ lin , i took a par@@ t-@@ time job at a veterin@@ ary hospital -- the night shift .
it was just me and the animals .
this is where he figures out who the mur@@ derer is .
as the months progres@@ sed , i had to figure out a way to pass the time ...
you stupid ape .
you missed a straight di@@ agon@@ al move .
... but i was bo@@ red , so , of course , i started dres@@ sing up this one bab@@ oon in human clothes .
just one more thing .
my name is chance brig@@ gs .
- very good .
- brig@@ gs . i own you .
own .
me owen .
sure .
you owen .
i 'm gon@@ na call you owen .
owen ! that 's right .
- owen .
- you owen !
- me owen !
- you owen .
you were a mon@@ key .
that expl@@ ains so much .
like how i have no human relat@@ ives .
and how i always think of you as a god .
ye@@ p . mon@@ keys are capable of many things .
too bad they aren 't better at sol@@ ving crim@@ es .
wait a minute .
i think i just figured it out .
i think i just sol@@ ved both cas@@ es .
if you 're right , then i 'll take back what i said about mon@@ keys not being good at sol@@ ving crim@@ es .
my partner needs to ask you some questions , chief .
if you don 't cooper@@ ate with us , ma '@@ am , we 're gon@@ na have to take you down to the station for question@@ ing .
don 't you get it , brig@@ gs ?
that 's not chief .
that 's not chief one bit .
that 's a bab@@ oon .
i won 10 large at the track , mon@@ key .
be back tomorrow before post time .
- crap .
- wait a minute .
what 's this money doing at your desk ?
okay , you got me .
i dress up this bab@@ oon to fill in for me when i go to the track .
it 's an old chief sur@@ geon 's trick .
i 've been doing it for 15 years .
your days of mon@@ ke@@ ying around are over .
yeah . it 's gon@@ na be a real hard day 's night for you .
let it be .
a bab@@ oon is so strong , they could tear a man 's head clean off his body .
which is exactly what he 's been doing ... for 15 years .
isn 't that right , fel@@ la ?
and there 's your confes@@ sion .
you 're in big trouble .
why ?
is re@@ plac@@ ing yourself at work with a mon@@ key a crime ?
in iraq , yes .
but not here , so ...
actually , i guess you 're not in trouble .
great .
thanks , guys .
how did you figure it out ?

it was beautiful there .
except for the mos@@ quit@@ o@@ es .

they were like vampire bat@@ s .
and for whatever reason , they were only bit@@ ing me .
you should see my back .
i 'm covered in bit@@ es .
i can 't stop scrat@@ ching .
except some of them , i can 't really reach ' cause they 're in the middle of my back .

that patient 's fi@@ ance wanted to don@@ ate his , but they weren 't a match .
but il@@ ly@@ ana is ?
yeah , it 's ... it 's actually ...
it 's even better than that .

sha@@ hir , she 's the perfect don@@ or for terry brown .
you 're talking about the dom@@ ino tran@@ sp@@ lant ?
when 's the last time you saved four lives in a single day ?
we 'll need to organize our sur@@ ger@@ ies so the wait time for each reci@@ pi@@ ent is as soon as possible .
they 'll need to be off of di@@ aly@@ sis and ready to go as soon as their organ@@ s arrive .
we 'll also need a team to confir@@ m that the reci@@ pi@@ ents are pre@@ pped and in the o.@@ r. by the time their kid@@ ne@@ ys arrive .
this is keith .
he 's our last reci@@ pi@@ ent .
but he 's in sever@@ e ren@@ al fail@@ ure and can 't travel to hope z@@ ion , so we will coordin@@ ate with st. donald 's to deli@@ ver his kid@@ ney .
this is all hands on deck .
i 'm gon@@ na bring in the junior resi@@ dents .
williams and mir@@ ani will keep things moving .
we 'll get se@@ kara to be our go@@ ph@@ er for the day .
the most important thing to remember is , we 've got one shot at this .
seven sur@@ ger@@ ies .
four har@@ v@@ est and three tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ants in the next few hours before the final kid@@ ney goes to st. donald 's children 's hospital .
if something goes wrong with one ...
and the domin@@ o@@ es stop falling , so no scre@@ w-@@ up@@ s .
everyone , dr. jeremy bishop , our ne@@ west gen@@ -@@ sur@@ g on staff .

sorry ?
the magazine .

josh lewis , professor of 18@@ th-@@ century po@@ etr@@ y .
or , well , i was until ...
has the , uh , has the nurse been in yet ?
no .
it 's hurry up and wait .
well , they have to test our blood first , so ...
yeah , make sure it 's okay to po@@ ison it .
yeah , the ir@@ ony 's not lost on me .
but , then , nothing about this place makes any sense .
i mean ...
i mean , i know ...
let 's get all the sick people , we 'll put them in one place , and then have them treated by some semi-@@ soci@@ aliz@@ ed be@@ aker head with a god complex .
sorry . didn 't catch your name .
dana .
but most people around here call me dr. kin@@ ney .
dr. kin@@ ney .

doctor of old poem@@ s .

trying to .
thought i might have at least one great nov@@ el in me .
although , now it turns out it might have to be a nov@@ ella .
or it might just be , you know , a professional haz@@ ard .
te@@ aching all that great liter@@ ature , making me think i can do it , too .
speaking of professional haz@@ ards ...
doctor be@@ comes a patient , huh ?
mm .
all done .

i 'm putting both of you under at the same time .
no food , no drin@@ ks , so finish up your be@@ ers , boys .
you ready to get off di@@ aly@@ sis ?

it 's been a long road .
thank you .
we 're just waiting for your don@@ or .
larry 's not big on cell@@ phones .
all he 's got is this old f@@ lip , and the batter@@ y 's always dead .
well , time is of the es@@ sence , emma .
he can 't just dis@@ appear like this .
he 'll be here , honey .
larry doesn 't have time for a lot of people , but his big sister 's one of them .
nobody can help an old guy with a chair , huh ?
- larry !
- larry .
must 've passed a dozen or@@ der@@ lies schle@@ pping this damn thing .
you 'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before li@@ z taylor here .
got your chair .
larry ...
they found a don@@ or .
what ?
i 'm getting my kid@@ ney .
the right don@@ or came in to trig@@ ger the dom@@ ino chain .
it is our lucky break .
well , i ...
i wasn 't expecting this today .
well , yes , i know .
this is all coming very fast .
but we need to move now .
we 'll get you into sur@@ ger@@ y short@@ ly .
but , uh ...
i was just reading this thing online .
a guy gave his kid@@ ney , and ... and , um ...
he develop@@ ed an un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able ap@@ petite for pum@@ p@@ kin pie .
wouldn 't eat anything else ...
just pum@@ p@@ kin pie , pum@@ p@@ kin pie , day after day .
i hate pum@@ p@@ kin pie .
are you seriously talking about pie right now ?
i ...
i just need time to process this , emma .
dr. re@@ id , maggie sent me down .
something wrong , dr. re@@ id ?
it 's fine .
just try to relax .
excuse me .
what 's going on ?
it 's the cad@@ aver@@ ic don@@ or .
we lost the right kid@@ ney .
how bad is it , maggie ?
right kid@@ ney 's lost blood sup@@ ply .
it 's a gon@@ er .
left one is hypo@@ plastic .
so , we are looking at a small kid@@ ney with a crazy arter@@ ial network .
might be too many to anast@@ om@@ ose .
well , terry 's pre@@ pped .
they haven 't opened him up yet .
what do you want to do ?
i promised four pati@@ ents they were getting off di@@ aly@@ sis today .
that is still the plan .
okay , we will cut a piece of her a@@ orta , use it to make an arter@@ ial cu@@ ff around the ren@@ al arter@@ ies , and then we 'll have one in anast@@ omo@@ sis instead of three .
okay .
go get ready for the next har@@ v@@ est , please .
m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
somebody page dr. bishop .
all right , ure@@ ter is free .
just the arter@@ y cu@@ ff to go .
so , the weather 's great in l.@@ a. why 'd you come back ?
i tried an emergen@@ cy spin@@ al cor@@ pec@@ tom@@ y on a 15-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old car crash vic@@ tim .
did they die ?
no .
no , i saved her life .
and i still got su@@ ed anyway .
wow .
that is rough .
yeah .
they had more law@@ yers on staff than doc@@ tors .
suc@@ tion .
i wasn 't getting any better ...
just saf@@ er .
from everything i 've heard about you , cau@@ tion isn 't really your thing .
the way you 're working those s@@ cis@@ sor@@ s , i 'd say it 's not yours , either .
okay .
here we go .
got it .
start per@@ fusion and get it ready for tran@@ sp@@ lant .
krist@@ ine .
oh , hey .
have you , um , seen a , uh ...
uh , yeah .
i 've seen her .
i 've been hearing her all day , too .
yeah .
i 've been trying to talk to her .
no , she doesn 't want to talk .
i don 't think she wants any help at all .
okay , well , what does she want ?
uh , well , what do you know about her ?
uh ...
she 's a trap@@ eze artist .
her and her partner took a bad fall .
he managed to pull through , but she 's having her ... har@@ vest@@ ed as we speak .
oh@@ h@@ h .
that 's so sad .
i-@@ i think i actually know the song .
" my pi@@ geon home , " it 's called .
it 's a lul@@ lab@@ y .
- lul@@ lab@@ y ?
- mm .
so she 's trying to put us to sleep .
not working .
well , it 's a song about reun@@ it@@ ing .
i think she might be trying to convince someone to join her .
when we met , i was the water boy for my high school basketball team , and i got stu@@ ffed in a lo@@ cker after practice .
did dan save you ?
no .
i was in the one next to him .
sounds rom@@ antic .
oh , it was .
took three hours till the jan@@ it@@ or found us .
what were you screaming , again ?
" my legs ...
i can 't feel my legs . "
sounds hil@@ ari@@ ous .
we knew if we could make it through high school together , we could make it through anything .
so far , we have .
time to go in .
take good care of him .
don 't tell me you don 't know the story of ab@@ el@@ ard and hel@@ oise .
no , but i have a funny feeling you 're about to tell me .
12@@ th century , paris .
hel@@ oise is this whi@@ p-@@ smart student who wants the answer to human existence .
well , that was her first mistake .
so she goes to study with pierre ab@@ el@@ ard , who 's the greatest schol@@ ar in france at the time ...
about 20 years her senior .
nothing wrong with that .
well , it was for her uncle ful@@ bert .
he found out about their affa@@ ir , beat the living crap out of ab@@ el@@ ard .
the lo@@ vers were ban@@ ished to live apart forever .
they correspon@@ ded by love letters for the rest of their lives .
so ?
what do you think ?
do you ever stop talking ?
um ...
when i 'm sleeping , i guess .
oh !
well , then , nigh@@ t-@@ night , professor .
oh , i 'm sorry .
you want one ?
not unless there 's we@@ ed in them .
no way .
which part of " i 'm a po@@ etr@@ y professor "
didn 't you understand ?
well , then , what the hel@@ oise are you waiting for ?
pass me a pot coo@@ kie .
m@@ mm !
m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
dr. re@@ id .
p@@ ali .
what 's up ?
i wanted to give this to her .
or to him ...
whoever 's don@@ ating to erin .
the don@@ ors are all anony@@ mous .
i can 't give you a name .
i-@@ i know , but the girls made me promise that i would give it to the person that helped their mom@@ my get better .
right .
i will see what i can do .
thank you .
you don 't know what it 's like sitting there hel@@ pl@@ ess while your best friend just gets s@@ ick@@ er and s@@ ick@@ er .
of course you know what it 's like .
you 're a doctor .
i ...
so you get why it 's so important to me that that gets to erin 's don@@ or ?
uh , yeah , just ...
i 'm sorry .
excuse me .
is everything okay ?
larry ?
oh !
where are you going ?
home .
what ?
why ?
i 'm not doing it .
i thought i was ready , but i 'm not .
i only came in today to drop off my sister 's chair .
okay , i know that all of this has been sprung on you , and you 're probably incredi@@ bly overwhel@@ med , but ...
all due respect , you have no idea what i 'm going through .
i made a decision .
i 'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone .
don 't let him leave the building .
- berger is still in the building .
- what ?
that was z@@ ach .
he spotted him pac@@ ing by the coffee ki@@ os@@ k .
which means he 's waf@@ fl@@ ing .
yes , which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his lat@@ te to get him back on board .
all right .
i got this .
hey , larry .
hi .
how do you know my name ?
my name 's dr. bishop .
it 's my first day here .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
i 'm leaving .
hey , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
just ...
just hear me out ...
just for a second .
i just moved back here from l.@@ a .
i was there training under this dr. pear@@ l@@ man .
amazing sur@@ geon .
gen@@ ius .
also ... a very pi@@ ous man .
and he taught me a lot of things .
including this hebre@@ w phrase ... " tik@@ kun ol@@ am . "
it 's from the tal@@ mud .
it means " re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing the world . "
says all of human@@ ity has a shared respon@@ sibil@@ ity to he@@ al and trans@@ form the world .
why are you telling me this ?
dr. pear@@ l@@ man , he 'd re@@ mind us about " tik@@ kun ol@@ am "
before every sur@@ ger@@ y we did .
larry , i think you have a chance to he@@ al the world today in the simpl@@ est , most pure kind of way .
and i know you 're scared .
i get that .
i really do .
i swear .
but i think it 's something worth considering .
and i don 't think you 'd still be here if you didn 't think so , too .
my mind 's made up .
the answer 's no .
i 'm sorry .
no .
so , there 's these , um ...
hm ?
um , you know ...
you know ...
double doors ... the kind that open in the center , and , um ...
but one of the h@@ ing@@ es was broken , so ... they ...
they kept that locked .
but he didn 't know that .
so , anyway , you know , he 's finally ready , and he 's got , you know , his tray of che@@ ese , you know , it 's just right .
and he 's carrying it like it 's , you know , the most preci@@ ous thing in the entire world .
and then bam !
his nose goes into the glass , tray goes everywhere .
there 's , like , honey all over his be@@ ard .
oh !
oh .
i 've come un@@ stuck .
oh !
who@@ op@@ sie .
hang on .
oh !
- what the ...
- here .
let me .
here .
should you be doing this ?
why not ?
because i 'm a ...
what 'd you say ?
a be@@ aker head with a god complex ?
no .
'@@ cause you 're higher than a lab mon@@ key .
what is going on here ?
um ...
relax .
josh just popped his i.@@ v .
i got it back in .
no , you can 't do that .
i 'm sorry , but this isn 't your charge , dr. kin@@ ney .
the hell it isn 't .
i 'm a sur@@ geon .
not in here , you 're not .
then what am i ?
i 'm sorry ?
if i 'm not a sur@@ geon , well , what am i ?
a dead du@@ ck .
that 's ...
that 's what he said .
i didn 't ...
that 's what you imp@@ lied .
in here , you 're just my patient .
right .
so , what are my chances of survi@@ ving this ?
dr. kin@@ ney .
no , seriously .
i have a re@@ occur@@ rence of stage 3 met@@ ast@@ atic breast cancer , so what are the od@@ ds i 'll be here ...
by christmas ?
that 's not fair .
you stay out of this .
as your patient , daw@@ son , i am asking .
i do ...
i ...
i 'm not ...
i don 't feel comfortable ans@@ wering that .
no .
of course you don 't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm ...
i didn 't mean to be ...
you 're all good now , josh .
thank you .
okay , then .
um ...
i 'll be back in a bit to check on you both .
great .
where did you two meet ?
uh ...
at audit@@ ions for cir@@ que .
two total mis@@ f@@ its .
her parents , rus@@ sian im@@ migr@@ ants , kicked her out of the house when she was 14 .
mine ... hardly even noticed i was gone .
she understood me .
yeah , i guess when you meet someone like that ... who gets you , quir@@ ks and all ... nothing else really matters , right ?
dr. harris ?
time of death ... 3 : 13 p.@@ m .
kurt ?
let 's get him back to his room .
okay .
i don 't believe it .
it 's my fault .
i pushed him too hard .
it 's no one 's fault .
he 's never been very good with sur@@ prises .
when we were kids , i used to jump out behind cor@@ ners , and one time ...
she popped out , and i hit her square in the mouth .
15 stit@@ ches .
i told you he 'd come ' round .
you were right .
i am scared .
i 've been scared my whole life .
you 've always been this golden child ...
good gr@@ ades ...
good friends .
we 'll give you two some priv@@ acy .
i 've always been this neur@@ otic mess .
that 's not true .
it is .
everyone thought it was a joke when i said i would don@@ ate .
but you stood up for me .
we 're in a good place , emma .
i don 't want it to stop .
it won 't .
you 're my brother .
that is never gon@@ na change .
oh@@ h@@ h , boy .
uh , hey , alex , i need you to come take a look at this .
what do we have ?
a frozen kid@@ ney .
larry put us behind sched@@ ule .
it must have been too close to the ice for too long .
even if we th@@ aw that , we 've got little chance of getting it to perf@@ use .
we 've come too far to turn back now .
so , what do you want to do ?
get me 10 bags of warm sal@@ ine .
and a blo@@ w@@ tor@@ ch .
kid@@ ding !
hold the blo@@ w@@ tor@@ ch .
all right , then .
that fre@@ ez@@ ing didn 't do us any fav@@ ors , but the warm sal@@ ine flus@@ h ... it looked good .
you think it 'll live ?
it has to .
okay .
su@@ turing the ren@@ al v@@ ein .
okay .
ren@@ al v@@ ein and arter@@ y are anast@@ om@@ ose .
okay .

let 's get him up to imag@@ ing ... now .
okay .
good catch , alex .

he 's con@@ ing .
the sw@@ elling from the ep@@ id@@ ur@@ al ble@@ ed is pressing on his brain st@@ em .
there .
that should relie@@ ve the pressure .
alex , it 's okay .
you can go .
i 've done plenty of these .
turn up the music , please .
thank you .
my daughter , molly , is , um ...
stud@@ ying psych@@ ology at queens .

no matter how old they are .
especially when you know the real truth .
yeah , i 'd like to apologi@@ ze for that .
no .

well , look at it this way .
what would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep alex away from you ?
so , how do we help her if she won 't talk to us ?
i don 't know .
you know , maybe he doesn 't see her , maybe he doesn 't hear her , but if he feels her , if he senses that she 's here ...
then what ?
he won 't move on , either ?
he won 't get better ?
that 's a bit of a stret@@ ch , don 't you think ?
charlie .
i 'm just saying , it 's not very scientif@@ ic .
no , look .
il@@ ly@@ ana , you need to talk to us .
he needs to be with me .
it was your time .
it 's not his .
you need to accept that .
he won 't make it without me .
he 's gon@@ na have to try .
i won 't go without him .
i can 't .
something 's wrong .
il@@ ly@@ ana , what are you doing ?
i love him too much .
his heart rate 's through the roof .
you need to go now !
i can 't .
i won 't .
he 's got a pet@@ ech@@ ial ras@@ h .
we need to get him to radi@@ ology right now .

i 'm sorry .
i had no idea .

i know , but i 'm ...
i 'm thinking that i just have to fight this in a different way for a while .
i 'm sorry , but this is insan@@ e .
actually , i think this is the san@@ est thing i have done in a long time .
you 're flying off to paris with a po@@ et that you met a few hours ago .
well , when you put it like that ...
instead of prolong@@ ing your life ...
alex .
i don 't want to prol@@ ong my life .
i want to live it .
hey .

so she kissed him , she smiled , and she cried . "
thank you , doctor .
so ...
how does it end ?
the story ?
oh .
- hel@@ oise .
- right .
does she find the real meaning of life ?
oh , she does .
oh , yeah ?
the love she found with ab@@ el@@ ard ...
that was the meaning of human existence .
oh .
love .
hey . what 's going on ?
nothing .
you ready ?
look , i get it , greg is your jacob , but we all know you 're going to end up with edward .
because you 're bella .
what is that reference ?
it 's on the tip of my tongue .

t@@ wil@@ ight , yes .
it 's only the greatest love story
- since shakespeare ... in love . - right .
yeah .
right , yeah , okay .
what are you talking about again ?
you spent than@@ ks@@ giving with greg , and that was not part of our plan .
you need to be with josh .
if not for you , then for me .
- why ?

my marriage is like the walking dead , okay ?
we are all just trying to get out alive .

do you need me to call valencia from a bur@@ ner phone and tell her there 's been a murder at the yoga studio so you and josh can have more alone time ?
you came up with that way too quickly .
oh , he pressed " ignore " "
oh ... oh ... that doesn 't feel good .

listen , dar@@ ry@@ l , i know i didn 't bring my " a " game ...
i think you need to go home .
wait , are you taking me off the case ?
please don 't take me off the case , because if you take me off the case , that means i 'm not working and if i 'm not working , that means i have to think thoughts .
okay , you 're not off the case .
but go home and work on the present@@ ation .
and then , when you come back on mon@@ day , i want you to be the happy rebecca that we all know and love .

hey , are you sure you 're cool to do the calvin dinner without me ?
well , i 'll do my best .
okay . uh , i got@@ ta hop off .
i 'm really working hard here .

it 's important to deal with one 's feelings head@@ -@@ on , because re@@ pressed feelings lead to depression .
what do you know ?
re@@ pression equ@@ als depression .
that is ...
_
i 'm tired , too .

there is nothing sexy about depression , rebecca .
listen , you better get your act together , young lady , or you 're gon@@ na run this new life off in the dit@@ ch .
how did you get in here ?
well , your de@@ pressed mind invit@@ ed me in .
and by the way , this place is a dum@@ p .
you ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something , anything ?
maybe a mur@@ al ?
i don 't know about this .
are you sure this is the din@@ ing table she wants ?
i don 't know .
- i want to surprise her .
- surprise her ?
with fur@@ nit@@ ure ?
she 's very pic@@ ky , du@@ de .
yeah , yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage .
you bought the kind you put in food , not the kind you scar@@ e ghost@@ s away with .
valencia 's intense , bro .
as sexy as she is , she 's intense .
she has final appro@@ val over all your clothing .
yeah , you know ... yes .
i really miss your cargo 's .
we all do .
guys , i 'm commit@@ ted to this relationship .
i want to contribu@@ te .
you know ? she 's done everything .
she picked out the apartment , she book@@ ed the moving tr@@ ucks .
we 're supposed to be a team and i want to do something for her .
so we gon@@ na do this or what ?
yes . yes , we are going to do this .
guys , we can bang this out .
according to this , it is a very simple - 7@@ 2-@@ step process . - 7@@ 2-@@ step process .
oh , hell no .
okay . we 're not doing that .
we lost hector .
what are you looking for ?
oh , my god , you 're still here .
tell it to me straight .
am i sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ?
i 'm not really here .
i 'm just in your imagination .
i mean , let 's face it :
you do have a very active imagination .
one minute , you 're walking down the street , the next minute , you 're in a big musical .
although , i got@@ ta say ,
i did love the pret@@ zel .
you did a good job on that one .
aw , it 's a sho@@ el@@ ace tip .
ugh , that 's gro@@ ss .
oh , my god , you 're looking for pres@@ cription me@@ ds in a dra@@ wer ?
so ?
listen , when i moved here , i thought i was okay , so i dum@@ ped them all my me@@ ds and now , you know , i realize that i 'm not okay .
i mean , look at me , i 'm falling apart here .
this is really bad .
so if i can just get my old pres@@ cription me@@ ds back , i 'll be okay .
uh , here 's a thought .
anxi@@ ety , depression ... how about you see a doctor first ?
i 'll go do that .
ten steps ahead of you .
thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice ,
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian .
what can i help you with ?
i 'm not myself right now .
we 're always our@@ selves , rebecca .
right . yeah .
no , so i don 't feel like myself .
this isn 't usually how i am .
like , i 'm normally very organiz@@ ed and focused .
sounds like you 're feeling out of control .
let 's del@@ ve into your chil@@ d@@ hood .
oh , i was afraid you 'd say that .
okay , so , i 've been through the therap@@ y wr@@ inger ,
i 've re@@ has@@ hed my chil@@ d@@ hood a ton .
and i don 't really want to do it again .
like , for me and for you , frank@@ ly , i don 't want to put that on you .
so here 's what i need .
i need these .
those are the me@@ ds i was on in new york .
oh , my god .
how did your body re@@ act to all this medi@@ cation ?
you must not have been able to feel a thing .
exactly .
num@@ b as they come .
so ... scri@@ b@@ ble scri@@ b@@ ble on your piz@@ z@@ le pad .
rebecca , your doctor in new york is a qu@@ ack .
he gave you a band@@ -@@ aid , not a cure .
my meth@@ od would be to do some dig@@ ging and figure out what 's really going on inside your mind .
and then we can discus@@ s the appropri@@ ate medi@@ c@@ ations .
so that 's great , but i need to be better by mon@@ day .
it 's a work thing , so ... we doing this ?
no , we 're not .
okay , well , you know what ?
you 'll be hearing from me on yel@@ p .
um , where is your rest room ?
say , what time is your husband join@@ ing us ?
he ba@@ iled at the last minute .
he has re@@ hear@@ sal for his sing@@ ing group .
and that 's more important than this ?
i don 't mind .
i 'm fine .
he does what he wants to do , i don 't care .
i do what i want to do , he doesn 't care .
it 's bas@@ ically the stor@@ y@@ book romance i dre@@ amed of as a little girl .
aw , you see ? you guys get each other .
that 's so cool .
how are my eyebrows ?
don 't care .
they can be won@@ ky .
few people know this , but bald eag@@ les aren 't bald at all .
you see , the name actually der@@ ives from a word meaning " white headed . "
and being a " white fe@@ ather , " well , i 've always felt very connected to our national bird .
actually , it 's my spirit animal .
may i just say this is an ador@@ able red ?
un@@ conven@@ tion@@ ally all@@ ur@@ ing , with the soul of a po@@ et .
thank you .
i got it at the gas station , but in the ten-@@ dollar bin .
in the future , you really should try some of the arizona win@@ es .
bl@@ end those with a smooth cam@@ em@@ bert ... m@@ mm ! heaven .
oh , i am imagin@@ ing that .
m@@ mm ... cam@@ em@@ bert .
it 's fun to say .
oh , you know what ?
let 's play a game .
you tell me everything about you , - don 't ski@@ p a thing , go . - okay .
i was born in irv@@ ine , california .
um , my favorite color is green ...
- not you . - oh .
ladies first .
of course .
i 'm sorry .
you know what ? calvin , you 're the guest , so you should go first . go ahead .
okay , well , um , i was born in pres@@ cott , but i knew a small town wasn 't for me , so i moved to the big city .
- phoenix ?
- tuc@@ son .
right .
yeah , and i , uh , met my lovely wife .
ten years of bl@@ iss ... and then she died .
it was a , uh , short and trag@@ ic ill@@ ness .
the last thing she said was ...
" calvin , " be happy .
" take life and ... and grab it . "
and you should .
you should take whatever you want .
just take and grab .
i 'm gon@@ na roll .
okay , let 's see ... pink p@@ ill with the number 55 on it ...
yes !
add medi@@ cation .
i 've always wanted to take this .
- wait a minute .
- what ?
do-@@ do i really need to tell you don 't take a p@@ ill you found on the bathroom floor next to the to@@ il@@ et ?
here me out , dr. phil .
it im@@ pro@@ ves focus and prom@@ otes go@@ al-@@ direc@@ ted behavi@@ or .
that 's exactly the mo@@ jo that i need .
rebecca , i know what it says , and i know what you need .
you need to focus on this :
josh could find you if he wanted to .
you have made yourself really easy to find .
you have been rej@@ ec@@ ted .
rej@@ ec@@ ted .
he doesn 't want you .
that 's reality .
deal with it .
no . i 'm not gon@@ na listen to you .
you talk silly .
oh , my god .
oh , what 's that , little p@@ ill ?
" eat me , rebecca " ?
well , i think i will .
pil@@ ls don 't talk .
don 't take it .
she took it .
let 's get to work .
all right , let 's see this present@@ ation ...
what is karen doing ?
she put two sp@@ aces after a period .
what is this , 1997 ?
well , those have to go .
okay ! yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's k@@ icking in right now .
and what are these , oxford com@@ mas ?
well , those have to go , too .
i just got@@ ta edi@@ t this whole thing before i even start .
i would love to show you around tomorrow morning .
there 's , um , the chino hills state park , the az@@ usa fish can@@ yon falls .
may i be so bold as to in@@ qu@@ ire your avail@@ ability and wh@@ ere@@ abou@@ ts tomorrow afternoon ?
uh , what ?
do you like jazz ?
hot jazz ?
is there any other kind ?
there 's a small place in south pas@@ ad@@ ena .
my friends who blow horn say it 's the best little jazz bo@@ ite in town .
would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth l@@ icks ?
- i would . - m@@ mm .
i would .
uh , but he 's , uh , busy .
he 's ... with re@@ hear@@ sal for his sing@@ ing group .
he 's always busy .
and , you know , he 's not much of a l@@ ick@@ er .
what time do you want to pick me up ?
okay , so i 've been up all night and i hung the fish , pain@@ ted the walls , put up the mur@@ al , cle@@ aned out the fri@@ dge , re@@ did the gro@@ ut in the bathroom and for the fin@@ ishing touch ...
you 're gon@@ na be so excited !
christmas lights !
so , may i ask who 's crazy now ?
i never said you were crazy .
that 's a der@@ og@@ atory term and i don 't think it really app@@ lies to you .
where were you in my senior gen@@ der studies class ?
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , it 's time to get down to business .
but you know , before i get down to business , i 'm just gon@@ na see what my friends are up to .
inst@@ ag@@ ram , oh !
valencia post@@ ed a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom .
it says ♪ christ@@ ened ...
how nice .
oh , nice to hear .
how 's that working for you ?
i don 't understand your question .
but you know what , i 'm starting to realize that maybe that p@@ ill was not what i needed .
oh , there 's a sho@@ cker .
just spar@@ e me .
spar@@ e me the wis@@ ecr@@ acks .
hey , it 's me .
you got any down@@ ers ?
is this enough of a dow@@ ner for you ?
oh , my god .
i could just mel@@ t into the chair , like , like a but@@ ter lady .
that 's good .
no , that 's bad .
because i can 't get work done right now .
oh , i have an idea .
it 's the most fantast@@ ic-@@ i@@ est idea .
that 's not a real word .
seriously , seriously , seriously .
seriously , are you busy right now ?
honey , hi .
yeah , i-@@ i 'll be home in , like , an hour , to@@ ps .
thanks , boo@@ bo@@ o .
valencia 's so mad at me .
we 've been here all night , and i haven 't even finished sor@@ ting the scre@@ ws .
josh , there 's still time to ba@@ il .
on the table , i mean .
we were friends with you before we even met this table .
uh , the truth is none of us really even
like the current table .
i hate this table .
we don 't like , um , this table .
and you 're going to ru@@ in your life if you stick with this table .
bros before ... tables .
i think it 's a nice thing you 're doing .
nic@@ est thing i ever did for a girl was pull out .
hector ?
she has tan@@ dem parking , so after i 'm there for a while , i have to pull out .
which is such a pain , ' cause it feels so great just to leave it in there .
the worst is when it 's alter@@ nate side of the street parking , ' cause then i got to park it in back .
i don 't even get why there 's a spot back there .
it 's so tight .
feels more like an exit .
so then i 'm going front , back , front , back ... and it 's all dirty in the back , so when i move it to the front , then that gets all dirty .
i 'm just happy i have a spot at all .
'@@ cause i used to have to pay .
well , that was edi@@ f@@ ying .
this bur@@ r@@ ito is a symph@@ ony .
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian 's gon@@ na be so happy to see me .
when i pop up , she 's gon@@ na be like ,
" w@@ hoa , you 're so chill !
i 'm gon@@ na give you all the drug@@ s " "
well , i want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around . h@@ mm .
i bet her vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ aner is filled with cool pharmac@@ eut@@ ic@@ als .
that 's such a good point !
i know .
i wonder what she has in there .
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian ?
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian , it 's me rebecca bunch !
i 'm really cool and chill now .
okay , not giving up , not giving up !
here , dr. ak@@ op@@ ian ?
oh , my god , it 's her pres@@ cription pad .
oh , i see it !
wait , she wouldn 't have left it by the window if she didn 't , like , want somebody to take it , right ?
yeah , it 's like a wiz@@ ard test .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait , wait , what are you doing ?
you can 't fit through there .
yeah , yeah , i totally can .
because look at me ... look how tiny i am .
i 'm tiny ...

you know i could
- have you both arrest@@ ed ?
- i didn 't do anything .
i 'm a student .
on what gro@@ unds ?
breaking and enter@@ ing .
first of all ,
i only half-@@ entered .
and second of all , as far as the breaking goes , you have no idea of my in@@ tent to ste@@ al your pres@@ cription pad .
i do now .
but since you were both st@@ oned when you broke in , and not in your right mind ...
i 'm willing to offer you a deal , ms. bunch .
make an ap@@ pointment and start to get help and i won 't press charges against either of you .
fine . yeah . you win .
let 's do this .
i will come in here ,
i will expl@@ ore my feelings , do whatever you want .
now can i have the drug@@ s ?
we 're done here .
i 'm done .
i give up .
i 'm gon@@ na take a nap here for just a ... year .
what about your job th@@ ing@@ y ?
oh , god , i hope dar@@ ry@@ l doesn 't fire me .
do me a favor ?
can you get my phone ?
i think it 's in your purse .
i know , i 'm just too tired .
can you get it ?
just put it in my hand ?
just place it inside my hand .
it 's coming .
place it inside .
- there .
- thank you .
hi , paula .
it 's me .
yeah , okay , listen , i got something to tell you .
i 'm not proud of it .
i can@@ not do the present@@ ation with calvin on mon@@ day .
can you tell dar@@ ry@@ l for me ?
i '@@ m-@@ i 'm actually with calvin , so i could just tell him .
what ?
we are at the hotel on east cameron and he just went out for ice , and i only have a second .
hotel ?
why are you at a ho ...
is that anita baker playing in the background ?
oh , oh , he 's coming back .
i got@@ ta go .
i need a cab .
uber .
i need an uber .
oh , okay .
actually , no , forget the uber , it 's just around the corner .
come on !
i 've never been in a hotel room with a couch before .
uh , all the per@@ ks .
i can 't believe i 'm doing this .
it 's like a fantasy ... like stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries and champagne is just gon@@ na mag@@ ically arrive at the door .
you didn 't !
don 't do it !
look at that .
it 's beautiful !
she 's gon@@ na love it .
i-@@ i feel so great about this .
she 's here . she 's here , guys .
m@@ wa@@ h . okay . okay .
what ?
left .
what is it ?
is it a pu@@ ppy ?
babe , what am i looking at ?
surprise !
it 's your new din@@ ing room table .
we stayed up all night making it for you .
- that you didn 't pick out .
- and i helped .
that 's so sweet .
so , do you like it ?
well ... it doesn 't match our other things .
it 's not exactly what i would 've picked out .
oh , well , i mean , if it 's ... not something you want , i mean , i guess i ...
you could take it apart and give it back ?
josh , you are so smart .
that 's a great idea .
give me a kiss .
i got to go back to class , you guys , but thank you so much .
oh , and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table .
yeah ? okay . bye .
she scar@@ es me so bad .
look , paula ,
i know your marriage is crap .
i get it .
and i get that you 're about to have the ho@@ tt@@ est sex of your life .
m@@ mm .
right . so why are you stopping me ?
because it 's not real .
it 's a band@@ -@@ aid .
you know that .
remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality , right ?
and i didn 't get it ?
now i get it .
you 're doing the exact same thing .
you need to face your real problem , and your real problem is that your marriage is dead .
and you need to fully feel that , and you need to face it , because this is just a tempor@@ ary fix .
it 's like a p@@ ill you found on the bathroom floor .
who would take a p@@ ill they found on the floor ?
look , look , i 've spent my whole life num@@ bing myself , okay ?
i have spent my whole life escap@@ ing to far@@ -@@ off places , and it 's only rec@@ ently , like , now , like , liter@@ ally this second that i realize , like , i can 't do that !
i can 't do that .
i have to feel my feelings .
it 's okay to feel , paula .
it 's been five years since i made love without the tv on .
and ten years since somebody held my hand .
i-@@ i miss my dead wife .
come here .
liter@@ ally the most entertain@@ ing day of my life .
rebecca , making a spe@@ ech like that in front of a potential client , that ... was brave .
also a bit fool@@ ish .
in most cas@@ es , clients would run in the opposite direction .
and i understand if this means you don 't want to work with me ...
look , let me finish .
you have the kind of no-@@ non@@ sense honest@@ y and raw emo@@ tional in@@ sight that i look for in a commercial real estate law@@ yer .
you are a wonderful woman ,
this weekend has been so special .
but marriage is a preci@@ ous thing .
if i could hold my wife for one more second ...
oh . don 't make me cry again .
is this al@@ pac@@ a ?
it 's so soft .
my dead white wife loved al@@ pac@@ a .
what did you say to calvin ?
he was so im@@ pressed , he 's not even seeing other people .
i mean , how did you swing that ?
i just was honest about ... about all the great work you do ,
i just made him see what you wanted him to see , that we 're a group of kick@@ -@@ ass law@@ yers and we 're a family .
feel your feelings .
everyone should feel their feelings .
everyone should always feel their feelings .
well , i , for one , am feeling pe@@ eved , because this copi@@ er ...
cor@@ k it , karen !
but this copi@@ er ...
cor@@ k it !
rebecca , i 'm very glad you 're wel@@ coming the opportunity to work on yourself .
i am so grateful to be here , and i 'm excited to face my problems head@@ -@@ on .
i know it 's gon@@ na be hard work , but it 's work that i am prepared ... it 's work ...
i 'm sorry .
i know i should just ... work ,
i should make sure this isn 't an emergen@@ cy .
one second .
_
you know what , i 'm feeling better already , actually .
so i '@@ m-@@ i 'm gon@@ na go to this very important thing , but i want to let you know that this is not over .
i 'll see you next week .
what ?
get out of here !
a rice cook@@ er ?
that 's perfect !
because valencia is mexic@@ an and i 'm filipino and rice is a stap@@ le in both of our ...
cultures . yeah . right .
uh , oh , sorry it took me forever to return your call from friday .
oh , my gos@@ h , you ... you 're so busy .
don 't even think about it .
hey , can i ask you something ?
anything .
is this a nice table ?
it 's a perfect table .
that 's what i think .
thanks .
no problem .
uh , hey , um , do you want to come over some@@ time , just check out the new place ?
there 's not a lot of fur@@ nit@@ ure , so there 's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our so@@ cks like in ris@@ ky business .
oh , my god , that sounds amazing .
yes .
when ?
now ?
just , like , don 't tell valencia , ' cause she thinks it 's stupid .
well , valencia 's stupid .
sorry . i 'm sure she 's smart in her own way .
but anyway i have the perfect sli@@ pp@@ y-@@ sli@@ de@@ y so@@ cks .
number 31 .
oh , no . don 't you start with me .
just keep walking , old man .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
get out of my life .
oh , my god , uh , dr. phil .
i 'm a huge fan .
- how you doing ? - oh .
i 'm s ... oh , my gos@@ h . i 'm sorry .
you 're actually dr. phil .
in the flesh .
it 's me .
even dr. phil has got to have his bo@@ ba .
i 'm ad@@ dic@@ ted to these things .
maybe you should , uh , get help for that .
you guys make a really cute couple .
oh . that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
no , no , no .
we 're just friends .
that 's so funny . he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny , but we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
yeah . g-@@ good luck to you , buddy .

market takes a tum@@ ble , here i am .
how about what happened today .
got up about 4 : 30 , hit the sno@@ oz@@ e button ... just the one time ... got up , sho@@ wered .
at work , sir .
what happened at work ?
let 's see .
i got to where i pick up the truck for deli@@ ver@@ ies .
finally .
i pull into the parking structure .
level " a " is full , level " b " is full .
level " c , " there was a comp@@ act spot , but i made it work .
what 's the name of the company you work for ?
golden gate fri@@ dge .
i am sick and tired of being sick and tired .
coun@@ cil@@ man dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s is air@@ ing out all of mayor perry 's dirty laun@@ dry .
is this who you want leading your city for another four years ?
he actually has some good points .
it 's too bad the old guy doesn 't have a shot .
he 'd need a miracle to win .
and what are the od@@ ds of two mir@@ acles in one month ?
not likely .
so , where are we on the body in the fri@@ dge ?
we 're waiting on schol@@ ls for an i.@@ d. and a cause of death .
i talked to someone at the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator company .
they 're gon@@ na send someone out to talk to us between the hours of 4 : 00 and 8 : 00 .
wow , that 's a huge window .
no ap@@ point@@ ments ?
you can get a specif@@ ic time , but you have to wait like three weeks .
okay , so i 'll have tan@@ ner wait around for the fri@@ dge guy .
you guys check in with schol@@ ls and see if she has a name for us .
will do , lieutenant .
so , i tried calling you this weekend .
yeah , i dropped my phone in the to@@ il@@ et .
total writ@@ e-@@ off .
and then i immediately got this new one with a different number .
but we 're still on for bow@@ ling tonight .
yeah , actually , i can 't .
i dropped my bow@@ ling ball in the to@@ il@@ et .
total writ@@ e-@@ off .
and then i immediately got this one .
but the guy told me to wait a couple days until the mar@@ ble sett@@ les .
ah , tri@@ be@@ ca , ge@@ ils .
come with me .
i want to show you something .
dis@@ gust@@ ing , isn 't it ?
- horrible .
- a cat did that .
anyway ...
how can i help you ?
we were wondering if you were able to i.@@ d. the fri@@ dge cor@@ pse .
ah , the very cold case , yes .
come with me .
i want you to see something .
the dece@@ ased 's name is charles michael bu@@ cket , and his finger@@ prin@@ ts match exactly those of a sail@@ or who 's been missing for three days .
- navy ?
- worse . coast guard .
dr. schol@@ ls , can you show the detec@@ tives what you showed me ?
trying to make me je@@ alous ?
- is that a whist@@ le ?
- in his wind@@ p@@ ipe .
and something tells me he wasn 't born with it .
although he did die with it .
we think someone shoved a whist@@ le down his throat after a strugg@@ le .
you can see the defen@@ sive wo@@ unds here and here .
why a whist@@ le ?
someone trying to send a message ?
don 't blow whist@@ les ?
someone 's telling him not to be a whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer .
but what was he blo@@ wing the whist@@ le on ?
no idea .
we examin@@ ed every other or@@ if@@ ice several times but found no evidence .
we 'll try and take out the whist@@ le and see if we can pull some dna .
mean@@ while , we 'll go pay a visit to the coast guard .
the commandant 's a very busy man , you know .
we appreciate you getting us in , pet@@ ty officer sn@@ ick .
chief pet@@ ty officer sn@@ ick , thank you very much .
and i thought you said you were coming at 2 : 00 .
isn 't it 2 : 00 ?
it 's 1 : 50 , which means i only got a 20-@@ minute lunch break , but whatever .
it 's fine . i 'll have a candy bar or something .
sorry , pet@@ ty officer .
we didn 't think it was a big deal .
detec@@ tives , commandant don van z@@ and@@ t .
come in , detec@@ tives .
that 'll be all , sn@@ ick .
you 're welcome .
first of all , i 'd like to thank you for finding se@@ aman bu@@ cket .
we are a bro@@ ther@@ hood , and when one of our brothers go missing , it hur@@ ts the whole coast guard family .
if there 's anything that i could do to ass@@ ist in your investig@@ ation , don 't be afraid to ask .
well , for star@@ ters ...
i 'm afraid that 's all the time that i 've got today .
c@@ po sn@@ ick will see you out .
we were really hoping to ask you some questions ,
commandant don van z@@ and@@ t .
i know you were , detective . i know you were .
you listen here , po@@ pe@@ ye .
this is a murder investig@@ ation , and we 're the murder police .
so start talking .
i think you 're outside of your juris@@ diction , detective .
this is an intern@@ al matter for the coast guard , thus to be hand@@ led intern@@ ally by the coast guard with no outside help .
all due respect , commandant , this base is in l.@@ a. county , so when somebody 's killed in l.@@ a. , it is very much in our juris@@ diction .
now , we 'd like to interview his bun@@ k mates . we want to talk to the last person who saw him alive , and we want to know why he ended up dead in a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
i don 't know how he disappeared or why he ended up in that re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator or how he got that whist@@ le down his throat , but if our investig@@ ation turns up anything of interest , i 'll be sure to call you .
c@@ po sn@@ ick will see you out .
we 'll see our@@ selves out .
okay . it 's my one job , but go ahead .
we need base access , we need to interview his ship@@ mates , but the coast guard ke@@ eps shut@@ ting us down at every turn .
because they know something that they don 't want to tell us .
it 's a classic case of keeping something secret .
if they want to get into a jurisdic@@ tional dick@@ -@@ me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing con@@ test , i 'm all for it .
it sounds like fun , and i like my chances .
go talk to the mel@@ anie bur@@ ke at the d.@@ a. ' s office and see if she can help us out .
got it .
- lieutenant . - ye@@ p ?
as predic@@ ted , the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator guy came as soon as i got in the shower .
damn it !
that 's so frustr@@ ating .
it 's like they know .
so i can either wait till tomorrow at the same time , or i can go to the ware@@ house in long beach and talk to them .
that 's a hell of a long drive , but i don 't think it can wait .
i 'll be all right .
there 's a dave bu@@ ster 's right next door .
tan@@ ner !
i 'm gon@@ na go with you .
this guy 's going to the chair .
as god as my wit@@ ness , he 's gon@@ na fr@@ y .
just back@@ ing up a bit , we don 't know who did it .
yeah , but we appreciate your enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
someone showed up to work today .
all right , what do you guys want , huh ?
just tell me what you want , and i 'm gon@@ na put it in your little hands .
all right ? you want a court order ?
you want a sub@@ po@@ ena ?
you want a grand jury ?
i 'm gon@@ na get you a grand jury .
we 're not quite there yet , mel@@ anie , but good to know we have you in our back pocket .
all right , so hit me . anything .
give it to me .
well , i guess we could start by getting sub@@ po@@ enas
- for some of bu@@ cket 's ship@@ mates .
- already done .
how about a search war@@ rant ?
check your in@@ box . already there . did it this morning .
- can i use your rest@@ room ?
- you just did .
- val@@ id@@ ate parking ?
- i would love to .
parking .
got here at 10 : 21 .
it 's 11 : 04 now , so that 's ... that 's ... that 's 28 ... 28 minutes .
no , that 's like 40 minutes .
sh@@ h . okay . these are 15-@@ minute increm@@ ents .
- there we go .
- we 'll just pay .
- i got this .
- please , just give us our tic@@ ket back .
can you just ...
'@@ cause i had it , and now i don 't have it .
- just give it back .
- this one is ...
you can stick it together .
ah@@ h ... oh . they 're not lic@@ kies .
it 's fine .
this is great . thank you .
come on , guys ! hurry up !
i told you . i don 't know anything about no body in no fri@@ dge .
so , no one looks into the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators when you take them off the boat ?
of course . every produc@@ t gets qualit@@ y-@@ control@@ led .
nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fri@@ dge ?
when my guys checked it , there was no body , okay ?
my guys know what they 're doing .
lieutenant , i 'm gon@@ na need you to look away for this one .
mr. ster@@ elli , let me ask you something .
how do you feel about dave bu@@ ster 's ?
it 's the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one destination for family fun .
- everybody knows that . - mm .
how about if i told you i had 5,000 tic@@ kets with your name all on them ?
i 'm listening .
have you had any inter@@ action with the coast guard ?
they come around sometimes , make sure the ship@@ ments get through with no has@@ s@@ les .
what ship@@ ments ?
they don 't tell me nothing , and i don 't ask nothing .
every once in a while , a ship@@ ment of app@@ li@@ ances comes off through the boat that i 'm not allowed to insp@@ ect .
they put it in a coast guard truck and take it off my hands .
that 's all i know .
anything else , you 're gon@@ na have to ask the coast guard .
thank you , mr. ster@@ elli .
thank you very much .
excuse me !
excuse me , se@@ amen and women !
we 're wondering if any@@ body has any information on the death of charlie bu@@ cket .
i got information .
but if you want me to talk , you got to beat me .
not you .
the other lady .
se@@ aman bu@@ cket was my bun@@ k mate .
we were closer than brothers .
i know this is difficult , but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him ?
no .
no idea .
he was a great sail@@ or and really popular , although , the last couple weeks , it did seem like he really had something on his mind .
i 'd say to him , " hey , charlie . you got something on your mind ? "
and he would say , " huh ? what ? "
like he had something on his mind .
you have any idea what happened to his stuff ... clothes , foot@@ lo@@ cker , deta@@ iled di@@ ary ?
yeah , i did find one deta@@ iled di@@ ary .
i didn 't think anything of it at the time .
you want to take a look at it ?
it might help .
yo .
" smas@@ h mouth " is two words .
a coast guard truck ? this late ?
we should go check it out .
we don 't have a war@@ rant .
oh , i think we 'll be okay .
what the hell was that ?
i can 't win@@ k .
tan@@ ner , hit the sir@@ en .
evening , detec@@ tives .
- is it ?
- how can i help you ?
how 's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look@@ -@@ see ?
i 'm afraid i can 't do that , detective .
i 'm on official coast guard business , so unless you want to take it up with the president of the united states ...
i 'll do that .
president obama , lieutenant pr@@ it@@ ik@@ in at@@ kins .
is it okay if we look inside a coast guard truck ?

vice president .@@ 45 says open the back of the truck .
hey , how 's it going , eh ?
are we in america ?
canadi@@ ans ?
what in the name of tim hor@@ tons is going on here ?
mr. president , we have a situation .
i didn 't know the coast guard de@@ als in the traff@@ icking of il@@ legal im@@ migr@@ ants .
there 's a lot you don 't know , detective , like how to ap@@ ply ey@@ el@@ iner or who won best picture in 1984 .
" am@@ ade@@ us . "
what were you doing with a tr@@ uck@@ load of canadi@@ ans ?
answer me !
okay , you want to play that game ?
well , we just found your dna on the whist@@ le inside of se@@ aman bu@@ cket 's throat , so you 're going down either way .
if you cooper@@ ate , maybe we can get the charges reduc@@ ed .
i don 't have to answer to you . i only answer to one man .
but there is one tiny bit of information you should know .
i have a horrible sh@@ ell@@ fish aller@@ gy .
- w@@ hoa , put down the shr@@ im@@ p !
- don 't do it , man . no .
put it down .
no . that 's no way to go out .
- nice knowing you , detec@@ tives .
- not like this !
- put the shr@@ im@@ p do ...
- oh , and an@@ gie ,
- ser@@ geant pe@@ pper says hello .
- don 't do it , man !
- dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s for mayor ! - no ! no !
this is great .
case closed .
we got our mur@@ derer , and we didn 't have to watch a jury scre@@ w it up .
who wants to see a fl@@ ick ?
this isn 't over .
we have to go after van z@@ and@@ t .
there 's a massive conspir@@ acy going on here .
officer sn@@ ick put a shr@@ im@@ p in his mouth just to protect it .
i don 't want to do 3-@@ d . it makes me diz@@ zy .
we can@@ not trust the coast guard to investig@@ ate itself .
i 'm not gon@@ na stand here and watch this get lost in the shu@@ ff@@ le .
tri@@ be@@ ca , the buck has offici@@ ally been passed .
it 's im@@ migration and ja@@ g cor@@ p 's problem now .
we all want to put the bad guys away and see the good guys get it all wrapped up nic@@ ely , which is why i 'm thinking we see " jack re@@ acher " at 8 : 15 .
i saw it .
brown stuff . rocks .
when did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good ?
sometimes i think we 'd make more of a difference without the bad@@ ge .
you 've just been so different lat@@ ely .
i 'm still incredi@@ bly at@@ trac@@ ted to you .
but something 's changed .
i 'm in a bad place , ge@@ ils .
you don 't want any part of this .
we 're doing good , an@@ gie .
we 're making a difference .
at the end of the day , you just got to leave the job at the job .
you 're right .
guess i 'm just having a bad year .
i 'm gon@@ na call it a night .
an@@ gie , promise me you won 't do anything crazy .
i promise .
set a course for dream@@ land .
relax .
i 'm not here to ar@@ rest you .
or sleep with you .
take me to pe@@ pper .
never .
ah@@ h , ah@@ h , a@@ ah ! your feet are fre@@ ez@@ ing !
okay , i 'll take you !
so , what are the canadi@@ ans for ?
are you putting together some kind of army ?
not soldiers .
vo@@ ters .
it 's right up here on the right .
- face forward .
- thanks , commandant .
i 'm done with you .
here 's your chap@@ stick back .
drive .
not until you tell me what the hell you 're up to .
you know what i see when i look out this window ?
no .
no more bull@@ shit .
you 're impor@@ ting canadi@@ ans to vote for dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s ? what is this ?
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
he 's gon@@ na win . he 's killing dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s in the pol@@ ls .
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
one way or another , he 's gon@@ na lose , and there isn 't a damn thing you can do abo ...
i 'm in .
oh . really ?
i thought that was gon@@ na be a lot harder .
great . good news .
where do we start ?
just act normal , and at a certain point , the commandant will contact you .
i 'm really happy you 're join@@ ing us , an@@ gie .
previ@@ ously on crazy ex-@@ girlfriend ...
whatever happened with you and your ex ?
ex ?
oh , greg , i 'm sorry .
- do you love her ?
- no .
you forgive me ?
of course , i forgive you , jo@@ sh@@ y .
love doesn 't work out for me , ever .
so you are un@@ happy .
yeah . du@@ h .
maybe it 's time you see what else is in your life , besides josh chan .
oh , my gos@@ h , you have changed my life ,
dr. dream ghost ak@@ op@@ ian .
you made me see past all of my del@@ us@@ ions that were holding me back .
josh , you don 't understand ?
you don 't see what this has all been about for rebecca ?
rebecca , are you in love with me ?

why do you have all these photos ?
ye@@ p , okay , so here 's what happened .
i had ... have ... had feelings for you , indeed , yes .
god , this is awkward , um , i came here to tell you that valencia ...
valencia and you are staying together .
- no ... i-@@ i-@@ i i gathered . - yeah .
i get it and that makes sense , yeah .
josh , i 'm actually very glad you 're here , because , um , i realized some things on my recent trip .
and , um , one of the things i realized is that i need to break my old patter@@ ns .
okay .
yes , uh , starting with ...
i 've been horrible to valencia , like , really horrible , and i really want to reach out to her .
- i really wouldn 't .
- i really think i should .
she really hat@@ es your gut@@ s .
under@@ stand@@ able , and i will just have to trans@@ cen@@ d that .
i am trying to break free of anything un@@ heal@@ thy or dam@@ ag@@ ing .
so , um , that starts with , uh , tras@@ hing these .
unless you want them .
no , no , that 's okay .
although , um , you know , some of those are great ang@@ les that you can 't get with a sel@@ fie , so , uh ...
- sure , yeah , yes . - yeah .
thanks .
okay , well , there it is .
that 's the last of the josh chan stuff .
there was stuff ?
no .
well , i guess i should go .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . of course , get out .
- get out of here . - yeah , yeah .
bye , josh .
can i get another beer ?
i 'm trying to study .
stud@@ ying and drinking at the same time : good decision .
i know , right ?
it 's easy .
it 's extension school .
i-@@ i don 't like to tell a lot of people this , but i got into em@@ ory business school .
it 's a pretty good school .
they call it like the harvard of the south .
i thought the harvard of the south was v@@ ander@@ bil@@ t .
no . no . no .
yeah , so i got into school , and then my dad got sick , so now i 'm working my way through school here .
you know ?
i can 't be s@@ ling@@ ing drin@@ ks to lo@@ ser@@ s until i 'm like 60 years old .
oh , boy , look at this .
just what i need .
- hi . - hey .
i thought you dr@@ ank at home base .
i drink anywhere , but i do my stud@@ y-@@ drinking here .
got it .
can i pull up a sto@@ ol next to you , or do you want to ... be alone ?
i could go home and drink some mou@@ th@@ wash .
mou@@ th@@ wash , wow .
that 's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself .
sad says the man with an open text@@ book ... next to an open contain@@ er .
this is fun .
i like this .
do you want to hang out for a while and insul@@ t each other ?
ah , what would your girlfriend think about that ?
um , heather ?
uh , yeah , no , we 're don@@ e-@@ zo .
oh , wow . i had no idea .
can i get you a drink ?
nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snar@@ k .
wait .
go back to the heather thing .
are you okay ?
let '@@ s-@@ let@@ -@@ let 's talk .
talk is not on the bar menu , but we could ask .
okay , so , yeah , here 's the thing .
old me would have been totally down for , like , an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned bar@@ b fest , but i 've decided rec@@ ently that i 'm trying to change my patter@@ ns .
so i 'm gon@@ na go .
no , come on . come on .
i 'm a glu@@ t@@ ton for pun@@ ishment .
stay . let 's do this .
we can make bad decisions together .
we could run in traffic .
no ?
okay .
boy , she really dig@@ s you .
she 's in love with someone else , but i figure ten , 11 years of me trying ,
i 'm a lock .
okay , what is happening ?
why are you throwing out all this josh stuff ?
i told you , i 've gone cold tur@@ key on the chan .
i 'm done .
it 's not good for me , and you know that .
d ... oh , g ... you have to keep the macar@@ oni portrait .
that took two weeks .
no , no , paula , i 'm breaking my old patter@@ ns .
break old pat ... i ...
what does that even mean ?
did you go to a bum@@ per st@@ ick@@ er store ?
no , i just realized a lot of things on my trip to new york , while i was in a bum@@ per st@@ ick@@ er store .
okay , but you 're right about this , actually , it has a lot of dry go@@ ods on it , it actually could be use@@ ful for my ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake kit ,
- so i will keep this .
- that 's my girl .
but everything else goes in the tras@@ h .
- h@@ mm , h@@ mm . - oh , come on .
not chann@@ y bear .
i for@@ bid it .
fine , maybe i 'll just put chann@@ y bear on a high shel@@ f in case of a ... be@@ ar-@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy .
but the rest of this is going , bye .
- oh , come on ... - bye , letters to josh .
first dr@@ af@@ ts , second dr@@ af@@ ts .
- in the tras@@ h .
- no .
- ye@@ p .
- that 's ...
- that 's insan@@ ity . - no@@ pe .
no@@ pe .
good@@ -@@ bye , josh thong that i never wo ... i don 't wear th@@ ong@@ s .
why did i even get this ?
you have finally lost it .
you have left the reserv@@ ation and i-@@ i can 't ... i 'm not ...
i can 't watch it . i don 't care . i don 't care .
i 'm not suppor@@ ting this .
no , u@@ h-@@ uh .
hey ... i 'm so nervous , aren 't you ?
that last test ...
was pretty easy , at least for me .
wow , that 's impres@@ sive .
you must be smart .
yeah , well .
i-@@ i don 't like to tell people this , but , um ...
oh , you don 't have to tell me something you don 't like to ...
i got into the harvard of the south .
em@@ ory ?
you know it ?
em@@ ory ?
the harvard of the south is duke .
no .
no , no .
em@@ ory . google it .
so , everyone , over@@ all there were some nice efforts , but , uh , some of you , i 'm sad to say , fell short .
i 'm really not sure what rub@@ ric you 're using to grade these , but ...
doesn 't take much of a rub@@ ric to see that you didn 't put in much of an effort here .
oh , well , you know , i work ful@@ l-@@ time .
my dad is sick .
i work two jobs and my husband is dead .
i am very sorry to hear that , but i ... was not involved .
your next as@@ sign@@ ment is an es@@ say due friday .
you can do better , mr. serr@@ ano .
you got into the harvard of the south , after all , which you somehow managed to mention on your test .
a multiple choice test .
so , you 're bust@@ ing my balls about an in@@ tro class at an extension school ?
cool , yeah . makes sense .
look , i don 't know you very well , but from where i stand , it seems like you 've made the choice not to try or something .
oh , please , don 't you worry about my decisions .
i will decide about my decisions .
cho@@ os@@ ing not to try , greg .
you got into em@@ ory , greg .
i mean , du@@ h , i could have done better .
i could have gotten an " a " on that test if i 'd wanted to .

you 're an idiot .
oh , my god , this is nut@@ s .
okay , you can 't give up on josh right now .
you are so close .
paula , he picked valencia .
like , in front of my face .
game over .
what ?
no .
game has just begun .
okay , you have anti@@ bodies to his sali@@ va .
you can@@ not give up .
you have tr@@ action .
he@@ -@@ he touched the side of your bo@@ ob , i saw it .
- can you get whoever that ...
- yeah , i will get that .
and ... just ... let 's continue the con@@ vo later , okay ?
and if it 's the people across the street from that church , just tell them i don 't believe and will never believe .
rebecca .
hello , everyone in josh 's family .
hi .
oh , my gos@@ h .
i haven 't seen you since the last book club .
i haven 't seen you got engag@@ ed .
how does it feel ?
it feels like i 've been waiting seven years for phil@@ lip to propose , because i have .
let me see the rock .
oh , my gos@@ h , i mean ,
phil@@ lip said he was going for it , but ...
he said you were so hel@@ p@@ ful getting it .
oh , it was no problem at all .
i helped my client , mo@@ she , through a very complic@@ ated sub@@ division deal , and he said he could hook me up with non-@@ blood diam@@ on@@ ds at a dis@@ count .
and never pass up a good dis@@ count , right ?
i know what you 're thinking ...
like , diam@@ on@@ ds , dis@@ coun@@ ts , those are some like classic je@@ w moves , you know ?
what are you doing here ?
jay@@ ma has something to ask you .
look , i know that this is sudden , and we haven 't known each other that long ...
god , i feel like i 'm pro@@ pos@@ ing or something .
you 've been such a good friend to the family .
you wrote j@@ ast@@ en@@ ity that letter to get into harvard .
unfortunately the letter was better than her application , but she did get into cal state north@@ ridge , which is the harvard of north@@ ridge .
yeah , it is .
anyway , what i 'm trying to say is , how would you like to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id at my wedding ?
you mean , be an official part of the chan fam@@ -@@ bam ?
she 'd love to .
you want me to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id .
aw , you 're such a lovely girl , rebecca .
we would be so hon@@ o@@ red if you would become a part of our family wedding .
and you are the perfect he@@ ight to pair with phil@@ lip 's friend , daniel , who stopped growing after being a kid gym@@ n@@ ast .
um , actually , i-@@ i don 't know if i should .
okay , hey , why don 't we just ... ?
o-@@ one second , chan ladies .
come here .
one ...
one-@@ one second .
okay , this would kill valencia .
dead .
down in the ground .
like a bug .
legs in the air .
now she 's a ghost , bo@@ o .
okay , but , paula , what have i been saying ?
i need to dis@@ engage and dis@@ ent@@ angle from dis family .
know what i 'm saying ?
seriously , i-@@ i want to make am@@ ends to valencia , and this is like the opposite of that .
yeah , okay , well , who says no to being a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id ?
you can 't do that .
i mean , who does that ?
monster people .
- i have a question .
- no .
is valencia a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id ?
uh , not exactly .
by that she means no .
like , ew , no .
here 's the thing , i-@@ i 'd love to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id , but i don 't think it would be fair for me to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id and for valencia not to be .
i guess you 're right .
and josh has asked for valencia to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id about 50 times , so ...
great , so you get what i 'm trying to say .
so you can both be in the wedding .
sorry , what 's that ?
you and valencia can both be bri@@ des@@ ma@@ ids .
that way you don 't have to worry about her not being inclu@@ ded .
very wise , jay@@ ma .
it 's settled , then .
yeah , it is !
i know you , from sp@@ ider 's .
you were the sour@@ pus@@ s fighting with the girl in the shin@@ y dress .
hey , i 'm , i 'm not a sour@@ pus@@ s .
i 'm pen@@ sive and deep .
are you dust@@ ing po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
i like to look busy .
well , you 're out of dark ro@@ ast .
i can 't study without dark ro@@ ast .
could you get on that ?
oh , yeah , sure , uh , no problem@@ o .
thanks .
she 's cute .
are we being pleasant now ?
sorry , i don 't know your rules .
so , you two an it@@ em ?
me and ally ?
oh , i wish .
she quit her job as a manager at a whole fo@@ ods , came to work here .
i could not figure out why for the long@@ est time .
and then i realized ...
hey , i know that guy .
♪ gro@@ cer@@ y cler@@ k with half an ey@@ el@@ id . ♪
his name is bro@@ dy .
i can 't com@@ pete with him .
he has the flat@@ top of a gre@@ ek god .
this !
w@@ hoa , you are so good at magic .
how do you do it ?
u@@ h-@@ u@@ h-@@ uh . a true mag@@ ic@@ ian never reve@@ als his secrets .
come on , bro@@ dy .
so you like her .
yeah .
i don 't have a shot .
i mean , look at her .
i should give up .
i know that 's the right decision .
are you sure ... she doesn 't like you ?
watch this .
ally .
ally , though .
that 's my type , too .
oh , that 's so hot .
okay , bro , i got@@ cha .
i know exactly what you need to do .
so , you and valencia are friends ?
uh , kin@@ da .
i 'd say we share a history of common interest@@ s .
of course , she 's late .
she 's the kind of person that has to make an entrance .
you know what ? i don 't think that 's fair .
i wouldn 't stere@@ oty@@ pe her as someone that ...
oh , sorry i 'm late .
i just had some pictures taken for my hom@@ et@@ own hot@@ ties sub@@ mission to max@@ im .
we ready to try on some dres@@ ses ?
jas , come on .
let 's go pick out the first round of dres@@ ses .
this is beautiful .
- hey . - w@@ hoa !
hey , valencia , hi , oh , uh , this is going to be so fun .
are you ready to be , like , bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id bud@@ dies ?
i want to make myself very , very clear .
i know what happened .
i know about the kiss .
and if it were any other situation , i would take off my ear@@ rings , my exten@@ sions , and my wings , and cur@@ b-@@ stom@@ p you .
got it , that 's fair .
but , for some reason , you 're the one that got me into this wedding party .
josh told me it was all you .
- he did ? - ye@@ p .
i mean ,
i don 't know why you did it , but i don 't care .
just stay out of my way and don 't make me look bad to these people .
hey , valencia , i can do better than that .
i can make you look good .
yeah , yeah , like , by the end of this , they 're going to want to adop@@ t you .
but maybe that 's not , like , precis@@ ely what you want , but ...
oh , just shut up .
how about this ?
this seems like a style that would work on everyone .
well , most of us .
valencia 's right .
uh , you know , uh , two-@@ piece , halter , mes@@ h dress might work well for you very lean ladies , but , yeah , not for this festival of back fat going on .
okay , well , what about ... this ?
oh , my god .
those are such beautiful nip@@ ple covers .
yeah , those would definitely cover most of my nip@@ ples .
yeah , guys , let me re@@ mind you , i eat bag@@ els at night ...
valencia knows .
she knows all about my night bag@@ els ... tell ' em , v .
here 's what you didn 't know .
for my midnight bag@@ el , i eat it with but@@ ter , cream che@@ ese , and ... bac@@ on .
seriously . s-@@ r-@@ s-@@ l-@@ y .
like , true story .
okay , so why don 't we try different styles in the same color ?
that 's a great idea .
that 's so ni ...
you know what ? i 'm gon@@ na go out on a lim@@ b and say that 's , like , really grac@@ ious .
it is , actually , a , a good idea .
so you kids can go crazy with your hal@@ ters and your she@@ ath@@ s and your cu@@ tou@@ ts , and i will wear a dress fit to u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster a chair .
and i will wear it with pride .
rebecca , come on .
yeah , you 're not that dis@@ gust@@ ingly fat .
aw , thank you , valencia .
thank you .
paula .
what have we said about standing places , quietly waiting for people ?
i forgot .
okay , so how did it go with valencia at the dress shop ?
did you find any weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
i was thinking that we could use your role as bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id to really mess her up .
my first thought was po@@ ison oak in the dress .
ras@@ hy nip@@ s , instant classic . paula .
what ?
we 're not doing any of that .
- we 're not .
- no .
we 're just acting like normal people .
i 'm going to be like any other teen@@ age ex-@@ boyfriend 's sister 's last@@ -@@ minute bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id .
yeah , so just be cool .
understood .
i have my orders .
where can a person buy po@@ ison oak , and what is the ras@@ hi@@ est kind ?
richard kind is a 5@@ 9-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old actor , best known for his role in spin city .
no . po@@ ison oak , ras@@ hi@@ est kind .
jim ras@@ h is the a@@ war@@ d-@@ win@@ ning writ@@ er of the descen@@ dants .
come on .
you 're sure this is a good idea ?
du@@ de , she doesn 't like you .
she 's sho@@ wn no interest .
she 's way into someone else .
why give up now ?
this is the right move .
um , can i have everyone 's attention , please ?
hey , someone 's trying to let it rip here .
- thank you , greg .

let 's see how it looks with some nice b-@@ cup action in there .
no . i couldn 't .
valencia , you 're going to make a really beautiful bride .
josh is really lucky .
i hope .
i hope some day it is josh and me , i really do .
it will be .
and i 'm so sorry if i did anything to del@@ ay that dream .
i appreciate you saying that .
do you mind taking a picture of me ?
just for me .
i want to remember how i looked .
of course .
oh , i got nothing to work with here .
i mean , i 've already h@@ acked into valencia 's e-@@ ma@@ ils and her tex@@ ts .
o@@ oh , wait a minute , what 's this ?
a photo stream ?
oh , again .
you with the face .
what do you mean , how did i get valencia 's pas@@ sword ?
you know me .
let 's see what we 've got here .
valencia 's photos ... chocolate cake ... fried chicken ...
oh , she just likes to look at food .
oh , wait a minute , what is this ?
i think that 's jay@@ ma 's wedding go@@ wn .
you know , i 've ... i 've pr@@ ayed to god my whole life , and i , and i never knew if she was listening , but ... thank you , big mama .
uh , no wr@@ ink@@ les .
- yeah , or bub@@ bles .
- thank you .
we got this .
it says i have a new like on a photo .
i-@@ i didn 't take a photo , what is this ?
you ru@@ ined my wedding .
yeah , bitch .
- how could you ?
- what 's wrong with you ?
# hot@@ ter@@ than@@ the@@ bride ?
i-@@ i-@@ i didn 't do anything .
i didn 't post a photo .
and my has@@ h@@ tag@@ s are always positive .
like , # girl@@ boss or # fit@@ sp@@ o .
someone must be fr@@ aming me or something .
what kind of psy@@ cho with no life would do such a thing ?
oh , god , paula .
you must have done it .
when i went to the bathroom .
this is why women don 't go to the bathroom alone .
excuse me , miss , i have a bone to pick with you .
i 'm sorry , sir .
can i help you ?
yes , you can .
by helping yourself .
stop chas@@ ing after the car@@ tw@@ he@@ eling mag@@ ic@@ ian idiot boy , and start pay@@ ing attention to the guy with the boun@@ ti@@ ful , beautiful hair , who happens to really care about you .
oh , you 're friends with mar@@ ty .
i pre@@ fer men@@ tor .
ah , well , i 've already told him i 'm not interested .
him continu@@ ing to chase after me is a terrible decision , which makes me respect him even less .
i mean , maybe if he backed off and let me come to him , maybe i would think about it .
otherwise , can you tell him to stop with the songs and the tex@@ ts and the sky@@ writing ?
what did you sky@@ write ?
ly@@ ric@@ s to the song .
cost a fortune .
oh , and it was so win@@ dy .
i bas@@ ically paid for a cloud .
so what 's next , coach ?
what do i do ? what 's my next move ?
i don 't know .
i kind of think we do nothing .
i like that .
like for a day ?
we slow@@ -@@ playing ?
no .
i actually think forever .
i think we got to call this one .
go back to dust@@ ing po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
you laugh , but who likes a dust@@ y po@@ tat@@ o ?
mar@@ ty , ally 's right .
chas@@ ing someone who isn 't into you is a terrible move .
trust me , i feel you .
i 've been there .
you mean you and rebecca bunch .
your friends come in here all the time talking about it .
god , i hate my friends .
yeah , mar@@ ty , that 's right .
i did that with rebecca .
but watching you do it , i see what a bad call it was .
actually , i 'm realiz@@ ing , i make a lot of bad calls ...
in everything .
yeah , me , too .
and i think we 're the same .
i mean , i work here in a gro@@ cer@@ y store , even though i went to harvard .
the harvard of what ?
just harvard .
in boston .
your decisions are just the worst .
look , i already de@@ let@@ ed it , so don 't worry .
and we only got one like and it was from ...
om@@ g , it 's from max@@ im 's hom@@ et@@ own hot@@ ties .
i 'm telling you , it was rebecca .
she 's been " single white fem@@ aling " me since she got here .
valencia ...
you take one step closer , and i 'm getting a restr@@ aining order ,
jennifer jason leigh .
what i was going to say was , um ...
you were right .
ye@@ p , it was me .
yeah .
it was my idea for valencia to put on the wedding dress , and then when i saw her in it , i-@@ i got je@@ alous .
and so i , uh , i st@@ ole her phone and i post@@ ed the picture .
i 'm sorry .
i don 't believe you .
only someone crazy and sad would do that .
um , yeah , and i 'm both those things , so i 'm , um , i 'm sorry .
valencia , i 'm sorry we acc@@ used you .
rebecca , you should go .
ye@@ p .
good@@ -@@ bye , ch@@ ans .
before you start , you don 't have to buy me champagne or a fur coat ; just a simple thank you will suff@@ ice .
paula .
valencia 's pas@@ sword was so easy .
valenci@@ a1 .
i mean , come on .
paula !
just get in my office .
i told you not to do anything .
wait , what ?
i mean , why didn 't you listen to me ?
oh , my god , why didn 't i listen to you ?
because if i listen to you , nothing would ever happen with josh .
no than@@ ks@@ giving , no camp .
no kiss .
you , you didn 't do all that by yourself .
and every time you said , " no , paula , don 't do anything . "
and then i did anyway , and you were happy .
wow , yeah , you 're right .
okay , that 's the way it used to be , but it 's not like that anymore , okay ?
no .
paula , listen to me .
i 'm done with josh .
oh , come on , i saw you .
you can 't even throw away the macar@@ oni portrait .
- i threw it away .
everything 's gone . - even chann@@ y bear .
yeah .
chann@@ y bear sle@@ eps with the f@@ ishes .
no@@ pe .
i can 't give up on josh .
he 's not yours to give up on .
why are you so hung up on this ?
it 's for you .
it-@@ it 's to make you happy .
no , it 's not , because i just told ...
it 's because ...
if we 're not chas@@ ing josh , then you 're not going to want to hang out with me anymore .
i know it .
what ?
no .
paula , no .
that 's not true .
yes . yes , it is .
he 's our glu@@ e .
he 's what holds us together , and ...
i 've barely seen you this week at all .
paula , i love you .
okay , you know that .
but we have to stop .
it 's not good for me .
you and i will always be friends , okay , i promise .
but we don 't need josh chan .
because i don 't need him .
hey . hi . i 'm sorry , i , um , i needed somewhere to drink , and i thought , i thought you 'd be at school .
you 're here .
what 'll it be ?
it 's last call .
i guess , i don 't know , i 'll take some alcohol .
do you know any alcohol names ?
yes .
i will take a pe@@ ach sch@@ nap@@ ps on the rocks ?
no , never mind .
never order drin@@ ks again .
i 'll make you something .
that 's a lot of books you got there .
yeah , i 'm trying this really new radical approach to stud@@ ying ...
it 's called stud@@ ying .
wow . is it working ?
really well .
this is perfect .
what is this ?
it 's this really ex@@ otic drink called the gin and ton@@ ic .
well , i 've never heard of a gin and ton@@ ic before , but i think it 's gon@@ na be really big .
i 'm sending in the pat@@ ent .
hey , what are you doing after this ?
do you want to , like , i don 't know , go to another bar , get a drink , or hang out at my place , or ...
what happened ?
did you and josh get in a fight ...
is that what 's going on ?
and you need a shoulder to cry on ?
so you come to greg , ' cause that 's what i do .
no , that 's not what this is .
rebecca , i would really love to hang out with you ,
i would , but i know what that lead@@ s to for me .
and i can 't .
i can 't be in second place again with you .
great .
um , good to know .
i 'm ... i 'm gon@@ na go .
i 'm gon@@ na go .
greg ?
oh , josh , i thought you were someone else , i ...
what did you do ?
y-@@ y-@@ you h@@ acked into valencia 's phone ?
y-@@ you said you were trying to keep your distance from me , a-@@ and then you do this ?
this is how you make it up to valencia ?
okay , josh , it 's a long story , but all that matters is
valencia is now bel@@ o@@ ved by your family
- and i 'm out of the bri@@ dal party .
- yeah , but ...
josh , focus on your girlfriend and on your family , okay ?
and the next time you want to come and talk to me , don 't just show up at my door .
oh ... okay .
yeah , okay , cool .
um , so could you go ?
i-@@ i-@@ i have something i need to do .
are you k@@ icking me out ?
lil ' bit .
bye , josh .
i 'm sorry , chann@@ y bear .

wa ... you did what ?
it doesn 't matter .
no , good god , stop , woman .
greg , listen to me .
this isn 't about anyone else but you .
you 're not second choice .
i promise .
listen , if this is going to happen , - you need to know something . - okay .
this isn 't going to be like a roll in the hay and you go home .
this is going to be like three days of you and me just ru@@ in@@ ing each other .
and not emo@@ tion@@ ally .
is that what you want ?
when do we start ?
i 'm so glad we 're finally doing this .
me , too .
i mean , there 's so many girls i could have brought here , like a whole bunch , but i chose you , ashley .
- it 's ally .
- don 't care .
can we have sex now ? y@@ ay .
oh , my god .
you 're an idiot .
and you 're horrible .
why do i always make the same mistake over and over again ?
i make terrible decisions .
i go for the low@@ est form of man because i 'm afraid to be with someone i might actually connec@@ t with .
you know what ? scre@@ w this .
i 'm going back to nur@@ sing school .
wait , do you want me to do another car@@ tw@@ heel ?
i '@@ m-@@ i '@@ m-@@ i 'm good at those .
whatever .
she 'll be back .
they always come back .
and now behind the wall , the making of colon@@ y ...
my fellow colon@@ ists , welcome to day 341 of our occupation .
our choice is clear .
res@@ ist or die .
- roll sound !
- take mar@@ ker .
action !
colon@@ y , usa network 's block@@ bu@@ ster original series , is one of the most anticip@@ ated new shows of the year .
we came up with this idea of setting an occupation
- in modern day los angeles .
- it 's current .
it 's as if this happened now .
legen@@ dary television , part of the studio that produc@@ ed god@@ z@@ illa and pacific rim , and universal cable productions , the studio behind the ac@@ claimed original series , mr. robot , have te@@ amed up with cre@@ ators , carl@@ ton c@@ use ,
emmy a@@ war@@ d-@@ win@@ ning produc@@ er of lost and writ@@ er of the hit film , san andreas , and ryan con@@ dal , scre@@ en@@ writ@@ er of hercul@@ es , to bring you this comp@@ elling story of resistance and collaboration .
to be here , bringing it to life , and to see the scope and scale , it 's the most aw@@ esome part of the process .
over the next half hour , you 'll get an inside , behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes look at this intr@@ igu@@ ing new series , including inter@@ views with the cre@@ ators and cast ...
i tend to like a big story that i can 't even figure out myself .
... exclus@@ ive foot@@ age from the set and a sne@@ ak pe@@ ek at the unique and amazing world imagined by the cre@@ ators and crew .
they don 't know this yet , so just between you and me , you know , and whoever is wat@@ chin ' , we 'll let them know .
this is colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall .
get down !
you , come here !
what is this ?
what are you doing ?
- come here !
- i haven 't done anything !
you can 't do this , please !
colon@@ y is a story about occu@@ pied los angeles .
it 's about family .
it cent@@ ers around my family and our strugg@@ le to survive .
there 's been this myster@@ ious invasion by this very advanced outside party , and we don 't really know who they are , and they 've put up these giant 30@@ 0-@@ foot walls .
it 's kind of a family esp@@ ion@@ age thriller , but with some science fiction elements .
what would you do , put in this situation ?
what would you do for your children ?
what would you do for human@@ ity ?
who com@@ e-@@ who comes first ?
colon@@ y is the br@@ ain@@ child of cre@@ ators and execu@@ tive produ@@ cer@@ s ,
carl@@ ton c@@ use and ryan con@@ dal .
ryan and carl@@ ton are this kind of amazing dynam@@ ic duo .
carl@@ ton and i are both huge sy@@ fy fans , but we 're also big fans of history .
and one of the things that we both were fascin@@ ated by was paris , during nazi occupation .
we looked at a bunch of photos , and you would see these par@@ isi@@ ans , well-@@ dressed , sitting in side@@ walk caf@@ es , si@@ pping es@@ pres@@ sos , while nazi stor@@ m@@ tro@@ oper@@ s were going by in the street .
we thought that was a really interesting and incon@@ gru@@ ous image , that people were trying so hard to kind of keep the normal@@ cy of their lives under this incredi@@ bly re@@ pres@@ sive regime .
it just fascin@@ ated us , and we wondered ,
" well , what would that look like in-@@ in our city , wh@@ ere-@@ where we both live ? "
and we talked to legen@@ dary about it .
they loved it .
we set it up with usa .
and then we made the pilot last year .
and now , here we are , making a series .
legen@@ dary makes their first for@@ ay into television drama , with colon@@ y , and br@@ ings together a stell@@ ar cast , led by josh hol@@ lo@@ way of lost .
carl@@ ton called me , like ,
" i have an offer you can 't refuse . "
and sarah wayne cal@@ lies of the walking dead .
it 's a story i believe in .
it 's a character that i 've never seen before .
the ac@@ claimed cast also inclu@@ des thre@@ e-@@ time emmy win@@ ner , ka@@ thy baker , of pick@@ et fen@@ ces ,
peter jacob@@ son of house ,
amanda righ@@ etti of the ment@@ alist ,
true detective 's tory kit@@ t@@ les ,
carl we@@ ath@@ ers of rocky fame ...
apollo cre@@ ed !
... and paul guil@@ fo@@ yle of c@@ si .
we feel like we 've really got some great ac@@ tors on our show .
we were kin@@ da just with the charac@@ ters .
we 're sort of seeing the world through their eyes .
you have this world in which these people , who maybe were neighbor@@ s at one time , find themselves at od@@ ds with each other .
let me go !
one of the things about reading the script , it made me think about , how far you 'd be willing to go to res@@ ist .
it was a pilot that was about family , and about people making really , really difficult cho@@ ices .
for people to come back , week to week , it all beg@@ ins and ends with the charac@@ ters .
everything has suddenly been he@@ igh@@ tened , and the cho@@ ices that you make , who you side with , who you choose to trust , who trust@@ s you , become massi@@ vely important for your day@@ -@@ to-@@ day surviv@@ al .
it 's a polit@@ ical environ@@ ment .
everything you do has a polit@@ ical compon@@ ent .
thro@@ ugh@@ out human history , we 've either occu@@ pied someone , or been occu@@ pied by someone else .
it 's sho@@ cking what human be@@ ings will do in these situ@@ ations .
what would you do to survive ?
what are the comprom@@ ises you would make ?
what are the things that you would be capable of doing ?
good morning .
good morning .
you stin@@ k .
and you , you stin@@ k .
at the center of the show , is the bow@@ mann family .
will is a former fbi agent , forced underground by the occupation .
all the people who were police , and authority figures , military , was wiped out during the arri@@ val , and will was smart enough to go underground .
he and his wife , katie , must navig@@ ate this new world , where freedom no longer exist@@ s , and the consequences for dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence are dead@@ ly .
get up !
let 's go .
their relationship is already complic@@ ated .
they have true love at the core .
yet , they 've lost a child .
will and katie have three kids , but only two of them are living with them right now , ' cause their son , charlie , was caught on the other side of the wall when these myster@@ ious inv@@ ad@@ ers showed up .
and that 's frac@@ turing the family in various ways .
it 's bad enough he 's gone , but to see you every day hat@@ ing me for it .
i don 't hate you for it .
will and katie are desperate to get their kid back .
and so , will hi@@ red this guy to s@@ mug@@ g@@ le him into santa monica , to res@@ cue charlie .
you 'll be my 38@@ th run .
you got no@@ thin ' to worry about .
hop in .
you have entered the exclus@@ ion zone .
remain inside your vehicle until otherwise direc@@ ted .
my box kil@@ ls x-@@ ray and ther@@ mal .
they 'll never know we were here .
fre@@ eze !
hands where we can see them !
- get ' em up !
- move , now !
- stay where you are !
- on your knees !
keep ' em up !
put your hands behind your head !
medi@@ c !
get me a medi@@ c , now !
coming up , on colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall ...
find out how the show 's cre@@ ators built the world of occu@@ pied los angeles utiliz@@ ing fir@@ st@@ hand ac@@ coun@@ ts ...
juan , our director , grew up in argentina , under a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship .
... state of the art effec@@ ts technology .
story always comes first .
the visual effec@@ ts are a way to aug@@ ment and help tell that story .
... and good , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned hollywood magic .
hey !
where is my phone call ?
- let me out !
- i want my phone call .
- step back !
- i need to call my wife .
agh !
occu@@ pied los angeles is a world very much like our own ...
there 's blue sky .
there 's palm trees .
there 's good weather .
... with some e@@ erie differ@@ ences .
there 's an un@@ scal@@ able wall that surro@@ unds the city .
show cre@@ ators , production design@@ ers , and visual effec@@ ts speci@@ alist@@ s com@@ bine with cast and crew to bring this incredi@@ ble world to life .
colon@@ y is this kin@@ da wonderful bl@@ end of-@@ of elements that give you a-@@ a really unique look on what life in los angeles would be like if we were actually occu@@ pied .
this world 's just that ten per@@ cent different enough to really kind of make you sit back and say , " w@@ hoa .
what@@ -@@ what 's happened here ? "
the show p@@ icks up nearly a year after the arri@@ val .
a cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic invasion that changed everything .
every defense appar@@ atus was wiped out within eight hours .
all of a sudden ,
los angeles and its millions of cit@@ iz@@ ens , their lives were completely turned up@@ side down .
many were killed , many were taken away .
one of the first things that happened after the arri@@ val is , pretty much all the cars went away .
so , this is a very different los angeles .
a lot of people are on foot or riding bic@@ y@@ cles , so it has this very kind of paris@@ ian feel to the city .
we tried to kin@@ da come up with this idea that beauty and op@@ pression could co-@@ ex@@ ist .
you know , los angeles could look pretty and invit@@ ing , but , at the same time , it 's clearly now a host@@ ile environ@@ ment .
what 's great about what carl@@ ton and ryan have done in the concept , is just that idea of isol@@ ating it , fen@@ cing in group@@ s of people , cre@@ ates this tension .
slowly , but surely , you 're feeling what it is to be op@@ pressed .
i 'm a st@@ ick@@ ler for the-@@ for the logic of , uh , of the occupation , and of a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship , and how this ment@@ ality works .
i grew up in argentina , uh , during the ' 70@@ s , where we had a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship .
a ver@@ y-@@ - a-@@ a pretty rough one , but that a lot of the society was for it .
and i can see that happening very easily in america .
was an explosion at the santa monica gat@@ e@@ way , yesterday .
it was the resistance .
- those terror@@ ists wo@@ unded at least ten people .
- thank you .
who knows how many more they killed ?
we were going for a look that had a much more document@@ ary style .
we really wanted to make it look and feel very real .
that this could really be happening .
it 's very hand@@ held , and , you know , many times , we@@ -@@ we stag@@ ed the scene , without any specif@@ ic instruc@@ tions to the camera oper@@ ators .
and then we just put , you know , the three camer@@ as , as if they were a news team that are co@@ vering the scene for the first time .
uh , so it feels very immedi@@ ate , very real .
the production designer is in charge of the look of the tv show .
i 'm responsible for all of the things in front of the camera .
from building the sets to decor@@ ating the sets .
the sets are beautiful , which , right away , for an actor , that put@@ s you in a good place .
so , the yon@@ k is my bar .
this bar .
the yon@@ k is short for yo@@ kn@@ ap@@ at@@ aw@@ pha , which took me some time to learn how to say .
- thank you , ryan .
- i love the yon@@ k .
it 's kind of a bar that has a southern vi@@ be to it .
it definitely feels real .
oh , well , look who made it after all !
oh , you think i 'd miss the opportunity to drink public@@ ly for the first time in 11 months ?
as a designer , i was kind of excited about all of the kin@@ da graphic qualit@@ ies to it .
resistance poster@@ s , and poster@@ s that are more like pro-@@ occupation .
by the visu@@ als of what we put on the screen , we 're telling the audience where you are .
the visual effec@@ ts are a huge part , uh , of this show .
we have this tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous visual effec@@ ts partner , in ghost , who is our , uh , visual effec@@ ts studio , out of , uh , copen@@ hagen , in denmark .
they visu@@ aliz@@ ed an amazing pilot .
our walls , the 30@@ 0-@@ foot walls that sur@@ round los angeles , are an entirely digital creation , as are the dr@@ ones that pat@@ rol the ski@@ es .
yeah , the dr@@ ones ar@@ e-@@ - th-@@ they are little charac@@ ters of their own right .
th-@@ they are , essenti@@ ally , acting .
they 're in pat@@ rol mode , in se@@ ek and destroy mode .
in mo@@ des that we don 't know what they 're really thinking .
even though they 're mechan@@ ical , and they 're just w@@ hiz@@ z@@ ing around , you 'll actually see , they have different person@@ alit@@ ies .
ryan ge@@ eks out on all the science fiction stuff .
like , he was showing me pictures of dr@@ ones , and we were jum@@ ping up and down like children .
you know , it was like , yes !
i 've always wanted to be in battle@@ star gal@@ ac@@ tica , and , like , star wars , and all these amazing shows , and we get to do stuff like that .
the most difficult thing for ac@@ tors is trying to imagine elements such as dr@@ ones that they 've never even seen .
and my role is to ass@@ ist them to imagine this world .
we need to make sure that eye lines are correct , and they are actually looking at a dr@@ one that is somewhere that we 're not seeing in real life .
so , it 's especially challen@@ ging on a blue screen , or a green screen as well .
the tou@@ gh@@ est thing is , really , it 's the cars .
los angeles is a very busy city .
well known for , uh , its greatest ex@@ port ,
- which is traffic .
- to clean up these roads , and to make it look like we 're in a no-@@ car environ@@ ment , is really , really difficult .
so , we lock down lan@@ es of traffic as much as possible .
we pick off little pieces from our plate sho@@ ts that don 't have traffic in them , and it 's a really pain@@ ful process of painting them out .
- fire in the hole !
- action !
today is probably the@@ -- one of the big@@ gest sho@@ ts .
we 're gon@@ na have bullet hits .
uh , alien dr@@ ones w@@ hiz@@ z@@ ing in from the background .
next week , we 're , uh , blo@@ wing up an entire house .
each week , we get more and more excit@@ ing effec@@ ts .
coming up , on colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall , we 'll expl@@ ore occu@@ pied los angeles , and disco@@ ver the challen@@ ges faced by its cit@@ iz@@ ens .
if you 're re@@ sour@@ ce@@ ful and cle@@ ver , you can survive this occupation .
both the collabor@@ ators ...
there 's no victory to be had against these people .
what there is , is com@@ promise .
... and the resistance .
there 's a lot of fear and con@@ ster@@ nation go@@ in ' on .
that 's a good word , " con@@ ster@@ nation . "
con@@ ster@@ nation in-@@ in the colon@@ y .
i like it .
as you dig deeper into colon@@ y , you 'll disco@@ ver the op@@ pres@@ sive new world under which the cit@@ iz@@ ens of los angeles are forced to live .
there 's no communication .
there 's no internet .
there 's no cell phone service .
there 's no information that goes outside of these walls .
i 'm look@@ in ' for will bow@@ mann .
are you will bow@@ mann ?
sullivan .
ah@@ h !
not anymore .
los angeles is now under marti@@ al law .
a giant wall separ@@ ates the city into three blo@@ cks , each administ@@ ered by a prox@@ y government .
there 's santa monica , there 's the los angeles block , and there 's the san fernando valley block .
- where are you taking me ?
- green zone .
in the la block , where our charac@@ ters live , you either live in the flat@@ s or you live in the green zone .
the green zone is the more privil@@ eg@@ ed area , where the people that collabor@@ ate with the transit@@ ional authority live .
the hollywood hills and bel air , all those houses have been taken over and are occu@@ pied by the new elite .
they 're leading very nice , lux@@ ur@@ ious lives , wh@@ ere@@ as the regular cit@@ iz@@ ens are not .
they 're subject to r@@ ations and re@@ pression .
the show sort of explo@@ res that dich@@ otom@@ y .
i 'm the prox@@ y gover@@ nor of our little block here .
why am i here ?
to turn crisis into opportunity .
i take question with the fact that he 's a bad guy .
he collabor@@ ates with a clean conscience because i think that s@@ ny@@ der belie@@ ves truly that he is a force for good change .
wait@@ -@@ wait@@ -@@ wait .
hold on .
you can '@@ t-@@ - ah@@ h !
after the arri@@ val , the occupation government estab@@ l@@ ished their own police force , which the cit@@ iz@@ ens re@@ fer to as the red house .
they run ads , just like army ads . they 're tr@@ yin ' to re@@ cru@@ it people to control other people .
there 's a military cur@@ few in effect every night .
the things that you used to take for gr@@ ant@@ ed , like walking down the street to go get a cup of coffee , are not so easy anymore .
you don 't know , at any given moment , whether you might get ha@@ ul@@ ed out of your house and taken away , never to be seen again .
my brother got sent up .
the factory .
what is the factory they keep talking about ?
is it a concentration camp ?
nobody really knows what the factory is , or what it 's making , but what we do know is , is that people who go to the factory don 't ever come back .
in opposition to this new total@@ it@@ arian regime , stands the resistance .
a shado@@ wy group of figh@@ ters led by the myster@@ ious ger@@ onimo .
the resistance wants very much to end this occupation .
these are just every@@ day men and women whose lives have been turned up@@ side down .
people are willing to risk their lives to make change .
- a revolution .
- down !
how big is the resistance ?
who runs it ?
what 's their grand plan ?
how organiz@@ ed are they ?
those are all myster@@ ies that are a part of the show .
our host@@ s are tired of the insur@@ gen@@ cy .
you want me to collabor@@ ate .
in@@ filtr@@ ate the insur@@ gen@@ cy and bring us their leader .
does he agree with resist@@ ing ?
yes , but they 're going about it in the wrong way .
they 're getting innocent people killed .
am@@ id@@ st these war@@ ring fac@@ tions ,
will and katie strugg@@ le to keep their family safe .
they try to live their life the way they had before it was ripped out from under them .
family in a world like this takes on a new prim@@ acy .
ma@@ del@@ ine 's living with them , her sister .
and hudson , ma@@ del@@ ine 's son .
for mad@@ die , finding insul@@ in for her son is-@@ is one of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges .
certain conditions are de@@ em@@ ed un@@ wor@@ thy for treat@@ ment .
diab@@ etes is one of ' em .
this has to be kept cold .
it 's way too hot in here .
what do you think you 're do@@ in ' ?
- i 'm not bu@@ ying insul@@ in .
- a trade is a trade !
whether it 's trying to buy something on the black market , or whether it 's being out at the wrong place after the cur@@ few sir@@ ens sound , the world is full of all these per@@ ils that never exist@@ ed before ,
and our charac@@ ters are trying to navig@@ ate their way through this and survive .
if you can 't help me , then you and your wife , and your children , you 'll all be sent to the factory .
the most important day in human history is coming .
i just want you and your family to be on the right side of it .
the audience will learn more about who these myster@@ ious inv@@ ad@@ ers are , what they want , what they 're up to , what their powers are .
there are all these sort of lay@@ ers to the show that will be explo@@ red over time .
coming up , find out how the cast answers the question , collabor@@ ate or res@@ ist ?
i don 't know if i would have the courage to risk my children .
and the cre@@ ators give us a special sne@@ ak pe@@ ek of a scene from the premiere episode .
- don 't tell him .
- yeah .
don '@@ t- - just because he asked nic@@ ely doesn 't mean
- you 're gon@@ na tell .
- keep watching .
camer@@ as and mar@@ ker .
actor number two , action !
colon@@ y , usa network 's new original series , is a high-@@ st@@ akes drama about survi@@ ving in a new world .
it 's an old human story , but this is un@@ like any enemy we 've faced before .
these charac@@ ters , they come up against all sor@@ ts of dil@@ em@@ mas about , what are some of the comprom@@ ises that we need to make in order to survive ?
who are you , deep down ?
what kind of character do you have ?
and what would you do for your family ?
the charac@@ ters in colon@@ y must walk the fine line between collaboration and resistance .
nothing and no one is what they seem .
you don 't know who to trust .
we lie to everyone .
we lie to protect our@@ selves .
why are they collabor@@ ating ?
what is at st@@ ake for them ?
and that is the beauty of this show .
it 's a charac@@ ter-@@ dri@@ ven study of perspec@@ tives .
and now , here 's an exclus@@ ive sne@@ ak pe@@ ek at a scene from colon@@ y .
please , no !
no !
get off me !
get off !
usa network , legen@@ dary television , and cre@@ ators and execu@@ tive produ@@ cer@@ s ,
carl@@ ton c@@ use and ryan con@@ dal , have created the next great television drama .
all great stories are , at their core , human stories .
we get to take a fantast@@ ic universe and use it to ex@@ amine the contempor@@ ary issues of our own world .
it 's about humans batt@@ ling humans .
it 's about the things we 're capable of doing to each other .
it foc@@ uses on that un@@ break@@ able family bond .
big , heavy , moral decisions .
revolution .
we 're not telling you who 's right and who 's wrong .
there 's no black and white hat@@ s .
there are red hat@@ s .
kind of end up with this bit of a cas@@ ablanca story .
it 's this cross@@ roads of the world , where different people from all walks ,
occupation , and resistance .
and then the people that are just caught in between , trying to survive .
hope@@ fully , it 'll put yourself in the shoes of our charac@@ ters and our show , and you 'll wan@@ na ask the fundamental questions .
like , would i collabor@@ ate ?
would i be in the resistance ?
what lies outside the la block ?
is the world destroy@@ ed ?
it 's all a mystery , and that 's the fun of the show .
these are things we 'll have to disco@@ ver .
all of this , it 's tempor@@ ary .
once they 've satisfied their needs , they 'll leave .
what needs ?
colon@@ y premieres thur@@ s@@ day , janu@@ ary 14@@ th , at 10 / 9 central , only on usa .
the time has come to make your choice .
do you collabor@@ ate or res@@ ist ?
that 's a heavy question .
it 's easy for any@@ body to sit and say ,
" i 'd do this " or " i 'd do that . "
- i res@@ ist . - i might collabor@@ ate , if i got to make television shows .
i would like to think that i would res@@ ist .
i would really take my time to make that decision .
i may be a huge co@@ ward .
i have no idea .
when ya can 't beat ' em , join ' em .
collabor@@ ate and die .
i would do whatever it took to save my family .
anything .
finding a job where you get to work side by side with your friends can be the best .
it can also be the worst .
i came in with two friends !
thank you !
my name is cooper bar@@ rett .
my friends and i are here to mess up our lives so you don 't have to .
_
- yeah !
- yeah !
- to our succes@@ s .
- mm .
ah .
- hey .
- hey , how 'd you know i was here ?
what are you talking about ?
you 're always here .
what 's the occasion ?
oh , uh , their hang@@ over cure was just named " best new speci@@ al@@ ty bever@@ age "
because of us , everyone from your cas@@ ual char@@ don@@ nay si@@ pper to your har@@ den@@ ed alco@@ hol@@ ic is wak@@ ing up to a better american morning .
this is how dr. pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin must have felt when he created the what@@ -@@ cha@@ -@@ ma-@@ cal@@ l-@@ it .
there are so many things wrong with that statement .
- who are you looking for ?
- i was hoping my girl kelly would be here so we could hang out , ' cause , you know , we have a thing .
oh , like a pat@@ ty from college thing ?
no , there can never be another pat@@ ty .
that thing was like a po@@ w@@ der ke@@ g .
kelly and i are just , you know , we 're best@@ ies .
- hi .

i would like to introdu@@ ce you all to my new girlfriend , ram@@ ona .

" hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett . "
i sound like opti@@ mus prime ?
you are not to sleep with her .
what ?
'@@ cause of ... ' cause of this .
this ?
there 's no this .
- so i can sleep with her .
- no !
listen .
solid girl@@ friends do not come easy to me , and i don 't want you and your pen@@ is mes@@ sing it up .
okay , first of all , she hasn 't even expres@@ sed any interest .
and second , if she did , and i went through with it , i hope you know i respect you enough to never tell you about it .
fine , i won 't sleep with her . thank you .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .
- hi .
- there it is .
_
pretty great , right ?
can 't buy public@@ ity like that . free samp@@ le .
oh , thanks . this makes it seem like you run the company by yourself . yeah , you don 't even mention us one time in this whole thing .
" barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure , " not cooper 's .
your grand@@ ma hasn 't been hun@@ go@@ ver a day in her life !
come on , guys , let 's focus on the big picture , all right ?
that company , hang@@ ender , won this award three years in a row , and we just beat them . it 's not about individual credit . plus , i would have sung your pr@@ aises
- if i was given the opportunity .
- " when asked how he was able
" to accompl@@ ish so much , he cre@@ d@@ ited the inspiration of steve jobs and a good night 's sleep . "
yeah , you 're right . that was my window , i blew it .
- i 'm sorry . i ...
- " and later , he wished to thank
" his two best friends : hard work
- and determin@@ ation . "
- oh , guys , i mes@@ sed up .
but it was a phone interview . i mean , you guys know i value you and your ideas .
yeah , hold that thought .
get your free samp@@ le .
barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure ?
- i 've heard that stuff 's made in an apartment , and you can taste pi@@ g fec@@ es .
what ?
where 'd you hear that ?
" barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure is made in an apartment with pi@@ g fec@@ es . "
that 's simply un@@ true .
i mean , he hasn 't had an accident in weeks .
i mean , if they would have said pi@@ g ur@@ ine ...
there 's comm@@ ents from this cooper@@ su@@ cks person all over the net .
obviously , the person who 's post@@ ing this has inside information , so they can do serious damage to our business , if they haven 't already .
okay , so how do we find out who this cooper@@ su@@ ck@@ s@@ 69 is ?
i 'm one step ahead of you , sir .
i 've trac@@ ed the ip address , and it looks like it 's someone ... in our apartment building .
- what do you want ?
- hey , vir@@ gil .
uh ... someone 's been trol@@ ling barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure online .
uh , you wouldn 't happen to know anything about that , would you ?
what is ... trol@@ ling ?
uh , it means people are making fun of us on the internet .
o@@ oh . which site do i do that ?
we 're not telling you to do that .
oh , i 'll find out .
i have so many " barry 's grand@@ ma 's so fat " jo@@ kes .
what ?
!
do you really think mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly is our trol@@ l ?
she 's , like , 90 years old .
well , we have to cross everyone in the building off our list .
you know what ?
i haven 't seen her in a few weeks . come to think of it , neither have i .
well , at least she led a good life .
actually , i think she collabor@@ ated in the armen@@ ian gen@@ oci@@ de . but still , ne@@ at lady .
i don 't get it . we 've checked every apartment .
well , not every apartment .
i can 't believe it .
i never would 've suspected it .
what are you guys doing in my apartment ?
welcome home ...
kelly .
or should we say , cooper@@ su@@ ck@@ s@@ 69 ?
wait .
were the first 68 cooper@@ su@@ cks already taken ?
this is impossible .
had anyone else in your apartment rec@@ ently ?
- any male visit@@ ors , perhaps ?
- or pol@@ ter@@ geist@@ s ?
i seen this episode of ghost h@@ unter@@ s where this one ghost went into this one du@@ de 's account and mes@@ sed up his credit . spo@@ ok@@ y .
no guys or ghost@@ s have been in my apartment .
i 'm the only one who uses this computer .
oh , and ram@@ ona .
wait , wait , wait , hold up . say ram@@ ona 's last name is miller .
- right ?
- you 're already for@@ getting her name .
you slept with her , didn 't you ? !
- you said she was a trainer ?
- yeah . so ?
because ram@@ ona miller is not a personal trainer .
she is the president and ceo of hang@@ ender , our main compet@@ it@@ or .
what ?
she clearly saw us as a threat , posed to be your friend , just to get in@@ fo about us to try to take us down !
to think , i almost slept with her .
come to think of it , she was asking a lot of questions about your company .
why the hell you tell her about our pi@@ g fec@@ es ?
why are you living in an apartment with pi@@ g fec@@ es ?
it 's stin@@ king up the entire building .
i think that smell was mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly .
what happened to mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly ?
honey ,
- i 'm so sorry .
- oh , my god !
i lose two of my best girl@@ friends in one day ? i 'm gon@@ na punch ram@@ ona in her lying , f@@ law@@ less face !
best plan is to get even .
i have an idea how to do that .
so do i , so what we do is ...
we all listen to ne@@ al because i value his ideas .
- really ?
- m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
thanks , co@@ op .
okay , kelly , first , you 're gon@@ na take ram@@ ona out to brun@@ ch .
but don 't let on that you know who she really is .
sorry . you 're doing great .
just pretend like it 's a normal brun@@ ch . and then i punch her in the face .
no . you make wit@@ ty conversation .
so , tell me about all that personal training
- that you definitely do for a living .
- oh , you know ,
- lots of bur@@ pees , that sort of thing .
- oh .
will you excuse me ?
i have to go to the bathroom really quick .
and then when she 's not pay@@ ing attention , you take her computer and pass it off to barry in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
- f@@ ake must@@ ache and tu@@ x@@ edo ?
- no !
cooper , be suppor@@ tive . yes , barry , like that , but , you know , something better .
got it .
barry , you 'll go to the kitchen where you 'll find me and cooper waiting .
- what is he doing here ?
- i 'm meeting leslie next door for lunch . i heard you guys were hiding in the kitchen .
- by the way , it 's me , barry .
- i know .
- you look like neil de@@ gras@@ se ty@@ son .
- interesting .
- just like the mil@@ ky way .
- come on , ne@@ al .
hurry up ! got to get it before she gets back from the rest@@ room .
she should really up@@ date this thing .
- i mean , os 7 ? total no@@ ob .
- ne@@ al !

unless josh 's wife comes by , notic@@ es kelly , and ru@@ ins the entire plan .
welcome to my life .
- kelly !
- leslie !
i thought i saw you .
hey .

i was just walking by , saw you ladies chat@@ ting it up .
uh , look at that . sho@@ el@@ ace is un@@ tied .
- dangerous . there it is .
- yeah .

... go through her data , can@@ cel her orders , and later , cooper will call to contact her clients .
well , i am sorry to hear that they cancel@@ ed , but we have a vehicle in your area which can get our produc@@ t to you within the hour .
all right , thanks so much .
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
- oh , yeah .
- mm . can you believe it ? your plan worked .
yeah , cooper , i can believe it .
can you believe that our near@@ est star , alpha cent@@ a@@ uri , is only four light years away ?
can i just say , i am really enjoying your neil de@@ gras@@ se ty@@ son .
it is fun and informat@@ ive .
you know what else is fun ?
the mil@@ ky way .
no , you already used that one .
plu@@ to is one-@@ third water . there he is !
this fan@@ cy hotel looks a lot like a b@@ iker bar .
it 's like an episode of sons of anarch@@ y that doesn 't end well .
i 'm pretty sure there is no episodes of sons of anarch@@ y
- i 'm telling you , this is the address list@@ ed on ram@@ ona 's work order .
this is cooper .
hey , cooper .
this is ram@@ ona miller .
- i 'm actually ...
- the president and ceo
- of hang@@ ender . i know exactly who ...
- who i am ?
i know that you know , but here 's something you don 't know .
that order you took from me was a f@@ ake .
- what order ?
- mor@@ on , give it up . i 've been one step ahead of you this whole time .
you may be easy on the eyes , but that doesn 't mean that you know how to run a business .
first rule is , don 't ever work with your friends .
second rule is shut up .
you 're obviously fla@@ iling here . let me put you out of your mis@@ ery and buy your company from you .
you didn 't listen to the second rule .
h@@ mm .
we 've been set up .
let 's get out of here before we get our@@ selves killed .
ye@@ p .
that was a close one .
okay . hi . there 's so many of you .
okay .
- hi , guys . hi .
- uh , okay .
hey , guys .
what are you doing ?
they gon@@ na kill us anyway .
- he 's not with us !
- sorry !
my must@@ ache fell off when they threw me through that window .
mercury has ...
damn !
all my space fac@@ ts are gone , ne@@ al !
okay .
tell me everything .
did you ru@@ b it in ram@@ ona 's face yet ?
uh , things didn 't exactly work out .
ram@@ ona tr@@ icked us into going to a b@@ iker bar , and ...
come on , cooper .
tell everybody what you 're really thinking .
what am i really thinking ?
" uh , the reason i don 't listen to your ideas , ne@@ al , is " because the one time that i do , we get ou@@ ts@@ mar@@ ted by a rival " and thrown through a window .
" maybe , ne@@ al , instead of compl@@ aining " that you don 't get enough credit , you should acknow@@ ledge
" that i 'm the br@@ ains of the operation . just sit your ner@@ dy face down in front of a computer ! "
- easy , cooper .
- " and you , you big bastard , get your ass back in the kitchen and handle the produc@@ t ! "
you know what , cooper , you 've gone too far !
i 'm out !
- i hope you 're happy .
- i didn 't even say anything .
okay , i don 't even know who 's y@@ elling at who here , but we need to focus on ram@@ ona .
so there 's no truth to what i said ?
- well , it was your plan . but ...
- oh , my god .
some words you can 't take back , cooper !
you have to go after ne@@ al .
don 't you see ?
divi@@ ding you guys like this , this is exactly ram@@ ona 's plan .
okay .
i think you 're giving her a little too much credit .
- hey , ne@@ al .
- oh , my god .
i heard you 're un@@ happy with cooper .
mm . yeah , it 's not going well .
you should 've heard the things he said to me .
you know that i think you 're incredi@@ bly impres@@ sive and that i value what you do .
thank you .
what is it that i do ?
the vir@@ al marketing .
your web site . the entire dat@@ ab@@ ase you set up was brilli@@ ant .
your idea for paj@@ ama tu@@ es@@ days .
full dis@@ clo@@ sure , i just didn 't feel like wearing clothes that day .
we could really use your skil@@ ls at hang@@ ender . and ... this would be your starting sal@@ ary .
i 'm sorry , is this some sort of joke ?
i mean , cooper and i are best friends .
i 'm not gon@@ na let one little pet@@ ty f ...
this is hang@@ ender .
- you 've reached ne@@ al f@@ iss@@ ley 's office .
- oh , louise ?
can you confir@@ m my mas@@ sage will be on a table and not one of those airport chairs ?
and , uh , i 'm out of lol@@ lipo@@ ps , so ... thank you .
i can 't let her get away with taking ne@@ al .
i 'll help you get her back , but it could get ugly .
she pulls a knife , you pull a gun .
she put@@ s one of yours in the hospital , you put one of hers in the mor@@ gue .
oh , i 've been dying to use that line from the un@@ touch@@ ables since ' 87 . may not have been worth it .
it 's not about reven@@ ge , okay ? it 's about business .
and if i want to succe@@ ed , i got to beat ram@@ ona at her own game .
well , what are you prepared to do , cooper ?
- that 's not hel@@ p@@ ful . - welcome to the rock .
- hello , ram@@ ona .
- hey , cooper .
if you 're looking for a job , i 'm afraid ne@@ al 's
- already hi@@ red an assistant .
- that 's not why i 'm here .
oh , good , because the girl who got the job
- is way more quali@@ fied than you .
- if you 're done ,
i have a little pro@@ pos@@ al for you :
you give me ne@@ al back , and i 'll forgive the attack on my company and i promise
counter@@ pro@@ pos@@ al :
i keep ne@@ al , ban@@ krup@@ t your company , and you come back to my place and we get rid of the sexual tension between us .
interesting idea .
let me consider / fantas@@ ize about that for a second .
not gon@@ na lie , that was amazing . but i still have to rej@@ ect your offer .
that 's too bad .
i have lots of mir@@ r@@ ors , and i had a terrible chil@@ d@@ hood .
listen , ram@@ ona , you have no idea what you 're up against .
i think i have a pretty good idea .
you may have ne@@ al , but i have a better produc@@ t .
and i still have barry san@@ del .
hi , barry .
i wanted to discus@@ s ... look , i know why you 're here and i 'm not interested .
but if you could just hear me out for one second , i think ...
it 's my grandmother 's sweat and tears in this cure , okay ?
liter@@ ally . that 's the two main ing@@ redi@@ ents .
look , i know cooper likes to ho@@ g all the credit and he called me a big bastard , but at the end of the day , we are still friends .
our break room has a mil@@ k@@ shake machine .
this is hang@@ ender . barry san@@ del 's office . hang@@ ender rules !
totally .
louise !
why am i seeing the bottom of my lol@@ li@@ pop jar ?

what 's going on ?
just whi@@ pping up tons of the cure for be@@ v con .
it 's a bever@@ age conference .

" our company " ?
you 're the only one left in your company . okay , i don 't need those guys . i was doing everything anyway .
i can 't read barry 's writing . does this say " cin@@ nam@@ on " or " cyan@@ ide " ?

- it 's barry 's process , so ...
cooper , the reason you got into this company is so you could build something great with your friends .
maybe you should go and apologi@@ ze .
it 's too late .
they made their choice .
i came here because cooper is too stub@@ born ...

i came here because cooper is too stub@@ born to tell you how much he needs you guys .

hey , kelly .
nice to see you .
oh ...
that 's the spirit .
ram@@ ona , kelly seems to you think that we 're just pa@@ wns and that you actually don 't value our ideas . that 's ridiculous .
okay , name one of them .
um ...
like the commercial we did about the girls in bik@@ inis talking to girls in bik@@ inis . bik@@ ini-@@ bik@@ ini .
no . that 's terrible .
- i worked two days on that .
- that was cream of the cro@@ p .
okay , fine , you 're pa@@ wns .
but you 're well-@@ paid pa@@ wns with offic@@ es and assist@@ ants .
kelly .
due to recent events , this mil@@ k@@ shake has become less del@@ icious .

barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure is made from an ag@@ e-@@ old reci@@ pe .

everyone .

as you all know , hang@@ over cu@@ res are becoming a bil@@ lion dollar industry , and we 've got the best one in the business .
my wonderful team has worked ti@@ re@@ lessly to bring you this incredi@@ ble video that will introdu@@ ce you to our brand . a video ?
oh , come on .
hang@@ ender was fo@@ unded by president and ceo ram@@ ona miller in 2011 after a bach@@ elo@@ rette party gone wrong in las vegas .
oh , yeah , they 're happy .
- she looks good .
- hang@@ ender is made from only the fresh@@ est and natural ing@@ redi@@ ents .
fresh ber@@ ries , fig@@ s , pu@@ bic hair , fil@@ th from humans and pi@@ g 's po@@ op .
what ?
wait .
what 's going on ?
ew !
ram@@ ona miller does not care about black people .
no !
i love black people .
what ?
oh , that 's not okay .
turn it off . turn it off ! and ...
hang@@ over cu@@ res for life .
move out of the way !
get out of here .
- it 's the best .
- that 's right .
who came up with that ?
what are you talking about ?
we did .
of course you did .
- that was a great idea , man .
- that was amazing .
all right , let 's get back to work . let 's get back to work .
- all right .
let 's go .
- y@@ ay !
- oh , hi . come on , come on , come on . - ga@@ ther round , ga@@ ther round .
this has no pu@@ bic hair in it .
no po@@ o .
hey , guys .
i just wanted you to meet my new best girlfriend , ren@@ ee .
my name is sha@@ w@@ na .
we have tons in common and we 're pretty much in@@ separ@@ able best@@ ies .
uh , you must be josh .
no . no that one . kelly .
did you meet ren@@ ee ?
look at her .
you 're so lucky .
ram@@ ona turned out to be , like , a ru@@ th@@ less shar@@ k , but she got hers .
so you and ram@@ ona aren 't friends anymore ?
you 're free to hang out ?
- yeah , of course .
- oh , cool .
ren@@ ee , i 'm going to have to ask you to leave .
it 's sha@@ w@@ na .
why are you still here ?
girls can be so cl@@ ing@@ y .
so , working with friends ... it can be hard but it can be done .
all you have to do is admit when you 're wrong and more import@@ antly than anything , admit when they 're right . and don 't let your pi@@ g ba@@ the in your hang@@ over cure . and maybe don 't own a pi@@ g .
ram@@ ona .
are you , uh , here to ap@@ ply for the bar@@ tender position ?
no , i came to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you guys on be@@ v con and to ask how you 'd feel about join@@ ing forces .
- absolutely not .
- what ?
- she 's crazy .
- welcome to the rock .
the bottom line is you guys have the better produc@@ t but you don 't have the re@@ sources to get it out there .
i do and i think together we 'd be un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
what do you say ?
i don 't know .
i have to ask my part@@ ners .
so don 't be afraid to team up with the people you love the most , because when it comes to work , it 's always wise to keep your friends close ...
let 's do it .
good call . ... and your enem@@ ies closer .
episode 1 war of empire japan , during the yon@@ gs@@ ama syndrome , went crazy for the kore@@ an entertainment industry . and its effect on the kore@@ an econom@@ y was 1.@@ 196 tr@@ illi@@ on won . ( about us $ 1 bil@@ lion )
the effect on kore@@ an econom@@ y that lee young ae , a top star in 60 coun@@ tries , made is 3 tr@@ illi@@ on won . ( a little less than 3 bil@@ lion dollars ) ms. lee young ae , even if she 's now married with kids , she 's still beautiful , of course . they may imagine " what if ba@@ e y@@ ong jo@@ on , who is still single , was my man "
but the women are not going crazy because of his fine si@@ x-@@ pack . the central reason is hal@@ ly@@ u - because kore@@ an dram@@ as ex@@ ist , he is receiv@@ ing love . as per one book which is written by one exper@@ t of the kore@@ an broadcasting system , even if young people in vietnam don 't know the name of their chief secre@@ tary of the commun@@ ist party , it 's said that there is nothing they don 't know about hal@@ ly@@ u star j@@ ang dong geon .
through hal@@ ly@@ u , the ye@@ arly ex@@ port sur@@ plus on general mer@@ chand@@ ise is 27 tr@@ illi@@ on won .
this inclu@@ des , of course , ex@@ por@@ ted dv@@ ds of our dram@@ as and ost music , the local hand@@ phones which appear in dram@@ as , the cos@@ met@@ ics in dram@@ as , even up to the cars they drive in the dram@@ as .
money . everything is turned into money .
the@@ d@@ duk@@ bo@@ k@@ ki@@ we ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ ye@@ at onth@@ estre@@ et is@@ enjo@@ yed@@ lik@@ e@@ afir@@ strat@@ e@@ itali@@ an@@ past@@ aw@@ hi@@ chis@@ ordered to eat .
at the moment they put the d@@ duk@@ bo@@ k@@ ki , a top star ate in a drama , into their mou@@ ths :
( in japan@@ ese ) it 's del@@ icious !
( in japan@@ ese ) it 's aw@@ esome , isn 't it ?
they have fallen for korea now .
i can 't be in love with you ( french )
look at this !
i 've never seen something like that .
they are in love with our kore@@ an tv dram@@ as .
( in japan@@ ese ) you 're in the way !
even japan , the country which gave the degrad@@ ation of colon@@ iz@@ ation for 36 years .
the country that consider@@ s the land of ko@@ gur@@ yeo as their land - china .
the country of gh@@ eng@@ his khan , who succe@@ eded in win@@ ning the larg@@ est territory in world history - mongol@@ ia .
( in mongol@@ ian ) got it !
dram@@ as of no other country but korea !
they are crazy about our dram@@ as .
cut scene !
did you just sp@@ it on me ?
!
sorry , sorry .
director , i can 't work like this .
to catch just one per@@ cent in the vie@@ wer rat@@ ings ...
just a bit .
our dram@@ as , which the whole world is watching .
money !
anthony kim empire production represent@@ ative
because they turn into money .
m-@@ o-@@ n-@@ e-@@ y .
money .
to make a drama that turns into money we need to use a writ@@ er who makes money .
of course we have to use ac@@ tors who make money . right now , " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge , " produc@@ ed by our empire production company , including its writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o , the money that was paid for the script for the last 7 years in my company ?
the cost for the cast@@ ings is only 86 bil@@ lions , 950 millions and 41 won .
with ro@@ unding it up , it 's 87 bil@@ lion won ( us $ 87 million ) . and out of a total of 29 dram@@ as that were ai@@ red i made 27 a succes@@ s .
i 'm moving within the ac@@ cur@@ ate probabil@@ ity .
and that probabil@@ ity is exactly made by my hand .
everyone , can you tell me what a drama is ?
a drama is a war with numbers .
over there !
represent@@ ative , you said that out of your total 29 dram@@ as , 27 succe@@ eded .
then , what is the reason why the other two dram@@ as failed ?
that means that the dram@@ as you will make in the future can possibly fa@@ il too .
ah , of course , you 're right .
the thing that made those two dram@@ as fa@@ il ... unless , in 2002 , the world cup which made all people in korea go crazy with red devil f@@ ever and mad@@ -@@ co@@ w disease be@@ ef contro@@ vers@@ y of may , in 2008 , happens again !
i 'll absolutely never fa@@ il .
there@@ fore people call the ring i 'm wearing " lord of the rings , "
and they call me the " king of dram@@ as . " everybody , the thir@@ d-@@ class people change the world , and the fir@@ st-@@ class ... enjo@@ ys that world .
represent@@ ative , what is the secret of your succes@@ s ?
represent@@ ative !
you 've already extended the term of the loan for 10 million won ( us $ 10,000 ) four times .
yes .
your address is still the same , right ?
you 're a drama writ@@ er ?
yes .
lee go e@@ un " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge , " a secon@@ dary writ@@ er .
i really like dram@@ as .
what have you written ?
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge .
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge ?
!
wow ! it 's the last day , today !
i 'm a huge fan !
i had no idea such a young person was the writ@@ er of that drama .
i 'm ... just a secon@@ dary writ@@ er .
by secon@@ dary writ@@ er , you run er@@ rand@@ s ... well , i also run er@@ rand@@ s , but the real work i do ... anyway , i think you wrote your job in@@ correc@@ tly .
huh ?
stric@@ tly speaking , you 're not a writ@@ er .
no , but being a secon@@ dary writ@@ er is a tou@@ gh job .
anyway , fix it .
this is wrong , too .
you have to write " jo@@ bl@@ ess . "
excuse me .
excuse me !
a secon@@ dary writ@@ er is also a job . for 365 days per year , sleeping bit by bit , doing all little cho@@ res like cle@@ aning and laun@@ dry , we 're also writing each word to get paid !
there@@ fore , i 'm not jo@@ bl@@ ess !
what ?
i 've paid that dirty expen@@ sive interest without missing even once , and made your bank gain profit !
i got the loan from the bank , not from you , aj@@ umma ! i don 't have much time now , so before pulling out my dirty tem@@ per , process this one . quickly !
except for the last 10 minutes of this final episode , we 've sent all the rest of the tap@@ es to be ed@@ ited .
manag@@ ing director oh jin wan empire production 's # 2 person the shooting team is now standing by at sam@@ che@@ ok , gang@@ won@@ do .
and 10 hours ...
there are only ten hours left until the broad@@ cast !
writ@@ er je@@ ong said she can 't write .
can 't write ?
she said she can 't write about that orange ju@@ ice as pp@@ l ( produc@@ t placement adver@@ tis@@ ement ) , so the script for the last part isn 't done yet .
so , how much per@@ cent ?
par@@ don ?
so how much per@@ cent of the probabil@@ ity to miss the broadcasting time ?
well , i 'm not so good at math ...
i ma@@ jo@@ red in liter@@ ature , so ...
there 's not enough time .
je@@ ong hong jo@@ o eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 's main writ@@ er , a career 20-@@ yr vet@@ eran .
[ mad dog in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong ] yes , writ@@ er je@@ ong , you 're working hard even in this situation that the time is exactly money .
working hard ?
well ..
i 'm writing this , not even eating a proper meal !
that 's why i sent 10 pack@@ s of fresh , excep@@ tional orange ju@@ ice .
haven 't you ta@@ sted it yet ?
represent@@ ative kim ... it 's a clas@@ sy and suit@@ able ju@@ ice for you , a writ@@ er getting paid 20 million won per episode .
this is the scene that our main character will die eleg@@ antly after fin@@ ishing his reven@@ ge .
so does it make sense for him to drink orange ju@@ ice there ?
writ@@ er , you know the hit@@ ter with a legen@@ dary rate , yang jo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ok of the samsung lions .
when there was a ru@@ mor about trad@@ ing him to another team , he said ;
" in my body , blue blood is running ! " ( samsung lions uniform 's color )
this is a sent@@ ence of faith for him to keep his lo@@ yal@@ ty to the team .
writ@@ er je@@ ong , right now , in my body , yellow blood is running . ( without honor@@ ific@@ s )
is it so difficult to make the main character drink orange ju@@ ice ?
what ?
!
did you just talk down to me ?
would i only talk down to you ? i can kick you out too , writ@@ er je@@ ong !
how dare you kick me out ?
hey !
i 'm ...
i 'm je@@ ong hong jo@@ o !
dram@@ as may be art to you for all i know , but to me they are business .
and with that one pack of orange ju@@ ice , 300 million won is on the line . if you 're not going to give up my preci@@ ous 800 million won , which you 've been paid so far for the script , then right now , add orange ju@@ ice into the script !
what if i don 't ?
this isn 't a request .
this is the order from the ow@@ ner who hi@@ red you .
orange ?
orange ju@@ ice my ass !
i 'm back !
you , seriously ... !
go e@@ un , does this make sense ?
huh ?
the main character who is about to have a hero@@ ic death dies after drinking the orange ju@@ ice of pp@@ l ( produc@@ t placement adver@@ tis@@ ement ) ? does it make sense ?
what kind of crazy guy would do this ?
-@@ who else ...
the che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong crazy dog .
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge final episode , the end .
go e@@ un ...
correct any ty@@ pos and send it to them .
yes .
oh , teacher ...
what did you do with that orange ju@@ ice ?
go e@@ un ...
the real artist should not com@@ promise for a dirty sho@@ ppy bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man .
you 've worked really hard , too .
then , i 'm leaving now .
teacher !
even so , what should i say if the production company calls ?
tell him that i 'm gone under the water .
( impl@@ ying " dis@@ connec@@ t all contact lines " )
i 'm leaving .
okay ... go carefully .
oh !
represent@@ ative , the ending has just arrived .
the phone you called is not avail@@ able now ... represent@@ ative , it 's already 1 : 30@@ pm .
why don 't you just tell them to feed that orange ju@@ ice to the ac@@ tors and shoot the final scene ?
where did that orange ju@@ ice come from ?
huh ?
before the main character dies , where did he get it from so that he drin@@ ks it ?
ah , well ... that ...
but , about that ... it was ex@@ posed 7 times , and one of them should be at least 10 seconds . for that , we got 300 million won ( $ 300,000 ) .
from the location to the description , di@@ alogue , entire scene needs to be correc@@ ted .
but ... now we have only 8 and half hours until the on-@@ air time .
if writ@@ er je@@ ong says she can 't write it , what else can we do ?
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
how did it go ?
according to chief moon , the ending tape hasn 't even arrived yet .
please don 't worry , tonight 's show will be ai@@ red without any problem .
at this rate , what if the broadcasting accident ( going blank ) happens ?
cha@@ ir@@ man ...
i am anthony .
that will never happen .
i worried for nothing .
i forgot for a moment that you are anthony .
after the show is finished , i will report back to you .
i 'll talk to you later .
represent@@ ative , what should we do ?
what is the secon@@ dary writ@@ er 's name ?
lee go e@@ un .
represent@@ ative !
that 's right , i 'm anthony kim .
teacher isn 't here .
i already know that .
represent@@ ative ?
actually , a moment ago , writ@@ er je@@ ong had a car accident .
teacher ?
she was on her way back to here , as she promised to correct the script .
but at the inter@@ section right over there , she had a thre@@ e-@@ car re@@ ar-@@ end col@@ l@@ ison .
th ...
then is teacher ... okay ?
don 't worry , i 've checked on her getting rest and falling asleep at er with my own eyes .
which hospital is it ?
before writ@@ er je@@ ong fell asleep , she asked you , miss lee go e@@ un , to correct the script .
me ?
she said that you 're a very compet@@ ent writ@@ er , who is like her other half .
but ... what did she say to correct .... ?
what do you mean , " what " ? of course , it 's about the orange ju@@ ice .
that orange ju@@ ice ... she said i should write that ?
yes , right .
you need to correct that orange ju@@ ice scene .
there is no way that teacher told me to do so .
she also said that you would answer like that .
then , from the location to stage direction and di@@ alogue of the charac@@ ters ...
up to the scene that the character dies after drinking the orange ju@@ ice .
you 're saying she said that i should correct all of them ?
that 's why i came here person@@ ally , not just called , although i 'm so busy now .
really ?
!
do you ... think i 'm telling a lie ?
n-@@ no .
we don 't have much time ...
start writing !
the time ... time 's running out .
writ@@ er je@@ ong said that there is a pretty good one among your practice scrip@@ ts .
ah , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong " ?
that 's right !
the touching story with the background of the japan@@ ese occupation era .
y-@@ yes .
writ@@ er je@@ ong told me to see that right away .
please bring that to the company tomorrow .
if you finish this one well , you can debut with the next show .
i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
let 's go !
debut ...
let 's go .
while we 're going , you should write the scene and send it to the team .
here ...
then ... now ...
that 's right .
we 're going to the film@@ ing location in sam@@ che@@ ok .
let 's go .
think well , how we can make the story that the main character drin@@ ks the orange ju@@ ice and die .
the issue here is where he gets the orange ju@@ ice from .
that 's right .
bu@@ ying the orange ju@@ ice doesn 't make sense , and receiv@@ ing it from someone else is also ... on top of that , you should manage as little change of what we 've already film@@ ed as possible .
then ...
ah !
the construction site !
the last reven@@ ge place for the main character is happening in the construction site , scene # 68 .
action scene in between the orange ju@@ ice box@@ es ...
- orange ju@@ ice bott@@ les rolling and falling down !
- picking up the orange ju@@ ice ?
- so then the ending ...
- drink it .
bang ! -@@ okay , we 'll go with that .
oh , director hong ! leave the camera ra@@ ils as they are , we 've just sent you the correc@@ ted script for scene # 66 and # 67 .
ah , you send the script for scene # 66 and # 67 ?
the main character 's phone scene at the hospital , cut it at the phone bo@@ oth nearby .
the hospital and cut ? yes . move , move , quickly !
orange ju@@ ice box@@ es and the distribution center , i 'm working on it now .
once the shooting is done , move from the beach ..@@ ... and take the road , 5@@ 20@@ m to the north from where you are .
road ?
i told you the distribution center .
there is one deser@@ ted stor@@ age unit .
hurry up to rent that place and set up that place as close to the distribution center as possible and shoot there .
how much time to get there ?
yes , we 'll arrive at 7 : 0@@ 4@@ pm .
we 'll be there in 2 hours and 35 minutes .
check the script in 3 seconds .
manag@@ ing director oh , call the broadcasting station and let them send a helicop@@ ter .
- a helicop@@ ter ?
- yes .
also ar@@ range a quick service motor@@ bike from the shooting site to the helicop@@ ter .
ah , y-@@ y-@@ yes !
scene # 69 is done !
send it first by e-@@ mail and move on to the next scene !
well , hurry up , please !
we don 't have much time .
be careful !
it 's the end !
prepare it quickly !
yes !
hey ! isn 't the smoke too much , huh ?
- the script is here !
- okay , okay ! okay ...
action !
cut !
okay !
let 's move !
everybody !
we 'll move to the next location !
here is the next script .
what ... ?
the final ending ?
we still don 't have it .
then what are we supposed to do ?
!
what time is it ?
yes , it 's ... 5 .. 5 : 27@@ pm .
hey !
move , move , quickly ! go !
go ! hey , move all the equip@@ ment and go !
represent@@ ative , the final ending ... so , how many minutes for its running time in m broadcasting ?
it 's 65 minutes and 20 seconds .
m broadcasting engine@@ er anthony 's plant@@ ed sp@@ y .
just now , director je@@ ong went to the control room with the tape .
alright .
let 's make one more scene .
huh ?
the drama of m broadcasting ( impl@@ ying " mb@@ c " ) has 65 minutes and 20 seconds until the ending , and k broadcasting ( " k@@ bs " ) one is already finished . so , we should make it 1 minutes and 30 seconds longer than m broadcasting 's drama , so that the rat@@ ing can be over 30 % .
isn 't it too f@@ ake ?
yesterday 's rat@@ ing was 24 % , but how can it be over 30 % even if i write one more scene ?
the possibil@@ ity that vie@@ wers will change the channel to another drama after watching their favorite drama is usually 5@@ 2.3 % .
more@@ over , our drama will have it 's final episode today .
the possibil@@ ity that vie@@ wers will watch our drama at the moment of one and half minutes when other dram@@ as are finished ?
8@@ 2.7 % .
but ... after killing off all charac@@ ters , there is only one scene left , where the main character will die alone , so what story can i make more ... ?
so , that 's your job anyway . in this situation when we don 't even have time to shoot the addit@@ ional scene , if we have to add one more scene ?
then ...
should we go with flash@@ back scene ?
that 's correct !
yes , represent@@ ative . among the scenes we 've film@@ ed before , please edi@@ t one flash@@ back scene quickly which possibly comes in mind of the main character , right before he dies .
flash@@ back ?
it will be inser@@ ted right before the ending scene .
running time should be about one and half minute .
yes , i got it !
represent@@ ative , look at this .
" main character , walking with a pack of orange ju@@ ice ... " " drinking orange ju@@ ice , " " orange ju@@ ice "
okay , let 's go with that .
the last script arrived !
move , move !
the rest , get out !
good , good , the last scene . once we 're done with this , it 's done !
from now on , the war is started .
read@@ -@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ y !
action !
the represent@@ ative came .
they are doing the final scene .
cut !
hey !
orange ju@@ ice clo@@ se-@@ up !
let 's shoot the clo@@ se-@@ up of the orange ju@@ ice !
cut !
okay !
the end !
good job .
hurry , hurry , hurry !
good job .
i 've film@@ ed it as you told me to do , but from here to seoul , it takes at least 4 hours .
there are less than 3 hours till the on-@@ air time .
don 't worry , the helicop@@ ter will be used .
excuse me , represent@@ ative . i 've just got a message , but because of the bad weather in seoul , the helicop@@ ter can 't come .
you us@@ eless bastard !
what about the quick@@ -@@ service motor@@ bike ?
well , he 's over there .
pd park , wrap it one more time .
yes .
how much are you ear@@ ning for a month ?
about 2 million won ( $ 2,000 ) .
why ? to s broadcasting station ( " s@@ bs " ) in seoul , not in kang@@ won@@ do , if you arrive there in an hour , i will give you 10 million won ( $ 10,000 ) . if you 're late by 10 minutes , 5 million won , if you 're late by 10 more minutes again , 2 million won , after than , not even a penny .
think you can do it ?
director park , len@@ d me that motor@@ cycle .

represent@@ ative ?
ah ... yes .
from here to seoul , 29@@ 3.8 km . ( about 160 miles ) the possibil@@ ity that b@@ iker goes in 300@@ km per hour and arri@@ ves there alive is 36.@@ 2 % .
if he and i , two of us go ... it 's 7@@ 2.4 % .
represent@@ ative kim !
it 's dangerous !
you can die !
anyway , life is 50 : 50 .
i can 't ru@@ in my life because of that half . what i 'm afraid of more than death , it 's fail@@ ure .
what are you doing ?
yes ?
the script is here , here ( in your brain ) , so to edi@@ t the scenes , you should come with me !

writ@@ er :
lee go e@@ un .
[ funeral home ] represent@@ ative , no matter how much i think over and over , i think you 'd better not go in there ....
thank you .
by the way ... how do you know my brother .... ?
at the accident site , i was there with him .
then , the person who repor@@ ted to 911 ... ?
and ...
i 'm also the one who re@@ quest@@ ed the last deli@@ very of the dece@@ ased .
the last deli@@ very .... ? the dece@@ ased accepted my request to make a deli@@ very within an hour for the distant taking three hours , and the reason he accepted that impossible request was because i offered to pay 10 million won .
that 's why the accident happened un@@ inten@@ tion@@ ally .
then , you are .... the reason why my husband died ... ?
you bastard !
what 's the reason you came all the way here and say such things ?
after killing my brother , how dare you show up here !
?
please calm down , please !
if it were you , do you think you can calm down now ?
yes , yes , yes .
i thought it 's the right thing for me to tell you the exact situation why the dece@@ ased passed away .
and this .
what 's the use of such money ? my husband is dead now , so what 's the use of it !
? even so , don 't you think you gave them too much ?
it 's from your personal account .
well , i feel sorry for them too , but actually you don 't have any legal respon@@ sibil@@ ity .
and he chose it on his own too .
i don 't think there is any reason for you to do that much ...
some one died while working for my drama .
and i 'm in charge of that drama .
is there any other reason needed ?
ah ... no .
but , are you really alright ?
don 't worry . the drama is finished , and starting tomorrow , for another drama ,
i will become a bad jer@@ k again .
what can i help you with ?
i came for an ap@@ pointment with represent@@ ative kim .

hello !

yes , you told me before .... oh , you did a good job before .
yes .
i came here because you told me before to bring my practice script .
oh , that 's right .
i 've prepared this one for 3 years .
it 's a histor@@ ical drama with 20 episodes , and i wrote the script and syno@@ p@@ sis up to 4 episodes ...
i got it .
i will contact you after reading them .
yes .

" teacher je@@ ong ... " ?
i mean writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o .

- i told you he 's not in the office now .
oh , she 's here now .
teacher !
so , it was you ? i was wondering which bastard dar@@ ed to touch my script , but it was you !
teacher , what 's wrong with you ?
what 's wrong with me ?
hey ! i brought a country girl from bus@@ an , and taught and raised for 5 years , but now you dare to put your knife on your teacher 's script ?
ah , wait !
wait !
what do you mean " put my knife " ?
i did it because i was told that you asked me to do it !
who , who , who told you that ?
i know , right ?
who told you that ?
you told me so ! you came to the studio person@@ ally , and told me that teacher je@@ ong had a car accident while she had to modi@@ fy the script ! that 's why teacher asked me to modi@@ fy it , so you said that the orange ju@@ ice scene must be inclu@@ ded !
i was atten@@ ding church . you came to me person@@ ally and offered to modi@@ fy the script , and in return , you brought your own script and asked me to read it .
but how come you blame me now ?
what did you say ?
so , your go@@ al was to debut , i see .
no , that 's not true !
no , teacher ! i 'm really w@@ ron@@ ged now !
hey !
here is the obvious evidence , but how can you say it 's mis@@ understanding ?
teacher !
i 'm going to bury you in this drama industry field .
let go of me !
ah , teacher !
no , it wasn 't me ! i 'm saying it wasn 't me !
why on earth are you doing this to me ?
what do you mean ?
" what do you mean ? "
all my efforts with blood and sweat , built for the last 5 years , became nothing at once , but you 're saying " what do you mean ? "
i am sorry .
as promised , i will read your script and if it 's good , i 'll contact you .
do you think i will believe that ?
miss lee go e@@ un .
do you know what is really innocent ?
fo@@ cus@@ ing on the go@@ al .
whether it 's money or succes@@ s , i just focused on it inno@@ cent@@ ly .

i don 't care about other people , but at least you should trust me .
i 'm not saying i don 't know how you feel .
but shouldn 't i clean up the mess you made ?
you 're do@@ omed now .
what do you mean " do@@ omed " ?
who made " empire production " company as the number one in asia ?
how could you say i 'm do@@ omed ?

yes , mr. cha@@ ir@@ man .
i 'll definitely finish this . secre@@ tary kim , before anthony , put writ@@ er lee mi hun through , and transfer all the lines , which secre@@ tary choi put through to anthony , to me !
all of them ! immediately ! writ@@ er kim , you 've hit the rat@@ ing 50 % three times , but don 't you think the pay@@ ment of 30 million won ( us $ 30,000 ) per episode from " empire " is too little ?
if you come with me , i will give you 40 million won .
writ@@ er park is on the line 2 .
then , please don 't hang up , and think it through for a moment .
secre@@ tary choi , what about writ@@ er lee ( mi hun ) ?
i couldn 't reach her yet .
by all means , put her through .
yes , writ@@ er park , this is anthony .
40 million won ?
writ@@ er kim , anthony is fired now , so he 's calling the number without thinking .
what will you do with the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act with " empire , " then ?
ah , you don 't need to concern about the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act .
i will get the invest@@ ment and handle it right away . you know me well , i 'm anthony .
i admit that anthony is good and res@@ ou@@ ce@@ ful . yes , i admit that .
but , haven 't you heard about writ@@ er je@@ ong ?
" eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge " was mut@@ il@@ ated by anthony .
what do you mean " mut@@ il@@ ated " ?
it had the rat@@ ing 30.@@ 2 % and was placed as the top .
i will treat you as a national writ@@ er , writ@@ er park .
what about 50 million won per episode ?
then , please don 't hang up , and think it through , yes .
secre@@ tary choi , what about writ@@ er lee ?
we didn 't request that side ... hey , excuse me !
ah , yes , yes , i got it .
i will give you more time to think about it .
writ@@ er lee is on the line 1 .
then , please don 't hang up , i will wait for your answer .
you .. you ... you !
what on earth are you ?
i 'm lee go e@@ un who scre@@ wed up in this field because of you !
[ pre@@ view ]
what i 'm mad the most is that such a kind like you is acting up with the power in drama production field .
you will be do@@ omed some day .
i 've always lived a fan@@ cy life .
of course , it 's not like that there was no shadow in my life .
by any chance , do you have about 3 million won ( $ 3,000 ) ?
the problem is that the shadow has been ...
are you in that much difficul@@ ty ?
continued since 3 years ago .
oh , i guess you have something to get some invest@@ ment from japan .
about 10 bil@@ lion won ... ?
- about 10 bil@@ lion won ... ?
- 10 bil@@ lion won ?
lee go e@@ un , lee go e@@ un ... yes , the name was definitely lee go e@@ un ... go e@@ un , don 't you want to make a drama ?
is this writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
be quiet , please !
king of dram@@ as , anthony can stand up again . to conqu@@ er the world again , i need you ,
lee go e@@ un !
episode 2 the@@ fal@@ lo@@ f thel@@ ord y-@@ y-@@ you ! what on earth are you ?
i 'm lee go e@@ un who is scre@@ wed up in the industry because of you ! this is the most crit@@ ical moment in my life . beat it !
because of money ... you scre@@ wed up what 's most important , my life ! what are all of you doing ? get her out of here !
please leave .
i 'll leave here when i 'm ready . what i 'm angry about the most is that my life has dis@@ integr@@ ated because of you , a thir@@ d-@@ rate bottom fe@@ eder .
what i 'm mad the most about is ... that such a person like you is acting up with the power in the drama production field .
you ... will be do@@ omed one day . by someone like you .
yes , writ@@ er lee . it 's me , anthony .
what are you looking at ?
!
if you , writ@@ er lee , is the top of " empire , " that means you 're the top nation@@ ally .
but the fact that the money you 're paid per episode was not the top level has always trou@@ bled me .
i will make you the most .
how about 60 million per episode ?
represent@@ ative kim , i get your meaning .
i 'm driving right now .
let 's talk about it later .
ah , i need to go to a meeting .
instead of just hanging up , can you consider it ?
i 'm beg@@ ging you , writ@@ er lee .
alright , then please give me 15 minutes .
yes , i got it .
let 's do that .
writ@@ er park , have you thought about it ?
i 'm sorry , represent@@ ative kim . no matter how i think about it , i can 't do it because of the bre@@ ach of contr@@ act penal@@ ty .
i told you i 'll take care of it at my end .
hello ?
writ@@ er kim , have you thought about it ? represent@@ ative kim , i appreciate what you said .
let 's do it together next time .
there is no next time for my pro@@ pos@@ al .
also , 40 million won per episode means total 800 million won ! ( $ 8@@ 00,000 ) . rather than getting 800 million won for working like a dog ,
i 'd rather take 600 million won and work like the prime minister .
hello ?
writ@@ er kim ...
shouldn 't you apologi@@ ze first before talking about nothing but money first ?
hey , represent@@ ative kim , because of you , i 've been rec@@ ently living by taking sleeping pil@@ ls .
how can you do that ?
since when did you respect me ?
i 'm hanging up .
represent@@ ative kim , haven 't you been ax@@ ed ?
ax@@ ed ?
i left on my own two feet .
hello ?
h@@ el ...
that !
[ name # 15 ] je@@ ong hong jo@@ o
[ name # 1 ] lee mi he@@ on
it has to be lee mi he@@ on .
only lee mi he@@ on .
writ@@ er lee , it 's me , anthony .
writ@@ er lee ?
what should i do , represent@@ ative kim ?
je@@ ong ...
writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o ?
that 's right .
it 's je@@ ong hong jo@@ o .
were you expecting writ@@ er lee min he@@ on ?
right now , she is beside me .
writ@@ er je@@ ong , right now , i 'll apologi@@ ze to you .
i 'm really , really sorry .
actually , i tried to immediately phone ...
you need@@ n 't apologi@@ ze .
you already know .
everybody wished to see you crash and burn .
anthony , you 're completely washed up .
um@@ m ...
represent@@ ative ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man said you should vac@@ ate the office right now .
3 years later ...
the represent@@ ative has arrived !
you are here ?
i 've always lived a brilli@@ ant life .
in the brilli@@ ant life , there can be both the light and shadow .
of course , it doesn 't mean in my life , there are no shadows .
the problem here is that shadow has been contin@@ uo@@ usly with me since three years ago until now .
however , i never felt un@@ happy . despite being ax@@ ed from the company , despite the company 's ban@@ krup@@ t@@ cy for which i would have to shell out 30 bil@@ lion won to start an@@ ew ; i was fine .
because i 'm not a kind of person who is ob@@ ses@@ sive about the past .
and i dre@@ amed my come@@ back again .
however , in the industry , i notice everyone quietly avo@@ ids me .
after that , even the invest@@ ments have been blo@@ cked and work has not gone well . even when i had no office , even moving again like that , even to the ex@@ tent of s@@ elling my home , it was not bad .
but ...
even if my mother were to die , i am not a person who cri@@ es .
i don 't want to cry . i can@@ not fa@@ thom why thro@@ ugh@@ out the past three years , without a regular fixed pat@@ tern , it 's like this .
i don 't think it is the case that there is no pat@@ tern .
whenever you feel anxi@@ ous , you 're touching your finger .
three years ago , what is the story associ@@ ated with that ?
although you are brus@@ hing it off with those words , it 's not so within your mind .
please , give me medicine . because we 've stopped your medi@@ cation , we could find that ( pat@@ tern ) out .
but because i 've stopped the medi@@ cation , i 'm crying again , aren 't i ?
i don 't have any more medi@@ cation . please give me some more .
re@@ lying on medi@@ cation can@@ not cure the disease .
you want to find out what causes mental inst@@ ability fundament@@ ally ...
so what is the per@@ cent@@ age ?
what ?
!
i 'm asking what is the per@@ cent@@ age of probabil@@ ity that i wouldn 't cry without the medicine .
the probabil@@ ity that i wouldn 't cry by taking the medi@@ cation is 100 % .
please give me medicine .
psychi@@ at@@ ry
welcome .
i will write a pres@@ cription for you .
but promise me , you will accept reality and over@@ come it .
that will be 50,000 won . ( appro@@ x . $ 50 )
it was dec@@ lined .
you 've arrived ?
yeah . nothing really happened , right ?
there is something that happened .
the land@@ ow@@ ner said if we didn 't pay rent by the end of this month , she 'll kick us out . next . if we don 't pay the gas bill on time , they 're going to cut the gas .
i really hate to tell you this , but ... it 's been months since i 've last been paid .
i couldn 't pay my credit card bill , so i 'm getting the push call from the card company .
i hope you will pay me by this month .

[ e@@ un yi 's gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el ]
i 'm going .
the order is ready .
mister ! we 're watching that , but how come you changed the channel ?
oh , please ... you women ...
what did you say ?
oh , seriously !
i was watching it too .
this isn 't right .
change it to a drama .
ah@@ jus@@ si , it 's 3 : 1 , you 're the minor@@ ity .
please just have this del@@ icious gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el , and con@@ cede the channel to them .
oh , the moment is gone !
i wonder what happened .
the fact that he was their son must have been reve@@ aled .
how do you know that ?
look at his expression .
it 's the hospital and she is shocked from looking at the test resul@@ ts .
probably , the doctor would say , " as per the test , it 's 99 % mat@@ ched . "
as per the test , it 's 99 % mat@@ ched .
then , at this moment , the mom would cry out the name of the son ..@@ ...
ji wan !
that 's right , the son 's name is ji wan , ji wan .
you 're aw@@ esome .
how ?
how come you figure even the di@@ alogue ?
i know right .
you could become a writ@@ er .
you could really become a writ@@ er .
that 's right , she 's much better than the actual writ@@ er !
- that 's right !
- why are you serv@@ ing the gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el here ?
ge@@ ez . i think we must send her to the broadcasting station .
why do you have so much to say if you came to eat some gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el ?
have you read that article ?
i have . it was really epic .
move the camera up@@ wards and bam !
and camera # 2 is coming in ... director hong , long time , no see .
have you been well ?
ah ... hello .
are you here to see represent@@ ative oh ?
i heard your contr@@ act with " empire " is almost up .
you should work with me soon .
but promise me .
you must accept reality and over@@ come it .
that 's a joke !

wat@@ an@@ abe group ?
when is the ap@@ pointment with writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o ?
i 'm sorry about the wait .
what are you doing that 's making you that busy ?
we were looking for some writ@@ ers .
there are count@@ less writ@@ ers , but what have you done for the last 3 years , not making connection with them ? well then sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , what br@@ ings you here without notice ?
yeah .
do you have about $ 3,000 on you ?
are you having that much of a difficult time ?
huh ?
do you not have even $ 3,000 ?
no .
while i was coming here , i just hit another car slightly .
but the other person wanted to sett@@ le it in cash .
i was planning on giving him about $ 3,000 but i forgot my wal@@ let at my company .
he must be waiting right now so just len@@ d me the money since it 's not that big of an amount .
ah !
what should i do ?
i too , forgot my wal@@ let .
why don 't you just call your insur@@ ance company ?
otherwise , you can get in trouble later .
of course .
there must be some invest@@ ors from japan right ?
huh ?
i saw that a minute ago while i was waiting .
i 'm having such a hard time because of this .
why ?
are they str@@ ict ?
they say this kore@@ an-@@ japan@@ ese is a pretty succes@@ s@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man in japan , but he says that he wants to inv@@ est about 10 bil@@ lion won ( $ 10 million ) to a kore@@ an drama .
10 bil@@ lion won ?
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ...
this is 10 bil@@ lion won project .
since we 're a big company , a pro@@ pos@@ al in such scale comes .
who would want to deal with a tiny company for this project ?
whatever .
if you are interested , you might as well try out for it .
the condition is simple .
the background of the drama should be japan@@ ese occupation era .
japan@@ ese occupation era ?
yes .
he 's saying that the drama should de@@ pic@@ t the fier@@ ce life story of a man , who 's bet@@ ting his destiny in the swir@@ ling sad history of the japan@@ ese occupation era .
but how could we find a script like that all of a sudden ?
i 'm chec@@ king with the writ@@ er 's group and also searching famous writ@@ ers too , but all they wrote were not really satisfac@@ tory , so ...
ah , ais@@ h . represent@@ ative ?
oh !
are you okay ?
represent@@ ative kim !
are you okay ?
japan@@ ese occupation era , in the whe@@ els of sad history , ...
it 's fine .

you had said that it was good that i quit when you were pay@@ ing off my de@@ bt of ten million won . now that we are making a dec@@ ent amount of money , if you want to go back to writing , you may do so .
i enjoy living my life ear@@ ning money with you better .

we were looking for a script for our next drama , and we happened to read your " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
yes ...
just a minute .
everyone , be quiet for a minute !
yes , you were saying ?
do you happen to be bound by a contr@@ act or production company ?
no , thats not a problem .
that 's good .
our company would like to make your " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " into a drama . what do you think ?
my " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
yes , if it 's ok with you , i would like to meet with you today .
today ?
where do i need to go to ?
no , i will come to you .
um@@ m ... miss lee go e@@ un , it 's been a while .
have you been well since the last time i saw you ?
get out right now .
miss lee go e@@ un .
i said to get out .
writ@@ er lee ...
i told you to get lost , you jer@@ k !
will you not let go ?
i know that i made a mistake back then .
" writ@@ er lee " ?
after k@@ icking me out of the field of drama writing , you 've got some ner@@ ves to call me " writ@@ er lee . "
because of you , i 've been called a sell@@ -@@ out who back@@ stab@@ bed her men@@ tor and other har@@ sh names .
because of you , my future as a writ@@ er was ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly crus@@ hed and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy@@ ed .
three years have passed , and you just show up and want to produce my drama ?
i 'm sorry . i sin@@ cer@@ ely am .
that 's why i 've come here to apologi@@ ze .
three years ago , you seemed to think that my work was a wor@@ th@@ less piece of crap .
what happened ?
do you suddenly like it ?
because it 's sin@@ cere .
who are you trying to fool ?
just tell me the truth .
yes , your script is cr@@ app@@ y and medi@@ oc@@ re at best , but it has some potential .
i 'm after that potential .
i told you not to talk rub@@ bis@@ h , just tell me the truth !
i got a rich ge@@ ez@@ er hook@@ ed on your script .
you ...
you ... are really low .
get lost .
before getting lost , i 'll just say one thing .
i don 't know if you 've heard , but i 'm completely broke .
all i have is an over@@ drawn bank account and that cr@@ app@@ y old car over there . i 'm behind on my rent pay@@ ment , too .
however ...
i can rise again .
the king of dram@@ as anthony can rise again .
to conqu@@ er the world again , i ... need you , lee go e@@ un .
i ...
don 't need you .
so get out .
didn 't you hear what my kid said ?
i guess making the daughter of me , park k@@ ang ja , miser@@ able three years ago wasn 't enough for you .
if you don 't want to die by my hand get out right now .
i 'll say one more final word .
i told you to get out right now ...
hey ... that guy said he would say just one more thing and then go .
let 's hear what he 's got to say !
yes , let 's hear him out .
fine , i 'm a col@@ d@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , re@@ pul@@ sive jer@@ k . but what does that have to do with you ?
what does me being a jer@@ k have to do with you giving up your dream instead of pur@@ su@@ ing it ?
so you want to spend the rest of your life here serv@@ ing mac@@ ker@@ el ?
just be content with telling your child one day , " your mother also used to have a dream once . "
dreams aren 't there to be remin@@ is@@ ced , but rather , to be ful@@ filled .
and the only chance to ful@@ fill this dream will be gone after tonight .
okay .
it 's okay if you hate me .
but don 't do something you 'll be sorry for , for the rest of your life .
what are you looking at ?
just stuff your faces with mac@@ ker@@ els !
good night .
good night . mr. kim , you had too many drin@@ ks tonight .
what ?
another bottle of so@@ ju , please .
ah , yes .
please visit again !
the food was good !
drive saf@@ ely !
oh , hello !
this was my last ray of hope after everything else has failed .
will it all end this way ?
two more dis@@ hes of gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els , please .
two more gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els .
do you plan on living your entire life gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els like this ?
and then are you going to tell your children that you had a dream at one point of your life ?
dreams aren 't something to look back on when you grow older .
dreams are there to be pur@@ su@@ ed .
it 's fine if you hate me .
but just don 't do something you will regret for the rest of your life .
mom ...
i 'm sorry .
i want to go .
that 's fine .
you must pur@@ sue your dream .
don 't worry about mom .
go .
any@@ ways , you ...
had no s@@ kill at gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els .
this is for the best .
mom ... silly girl , i just fired you !
fine , i can 't back down like this .
you 've made the right decision . i 'll tell you two things . first ,
i really hate people like you .
nast@@ y , dirty , gre@@ edy , soul@@ less sell@@ -@@ ou@@ ts .
you should keep that in mind .
thank you .
i 'm going to kill you for real . as long as you don 't kill me pain@@ fully , please .

if you make me cry one more time , she 's going to sli@@ t your throat .
this is quite a tou@@ gh family .
fine . now , it 's my turn to talk .
you 've got to watch your language , young lady .
mind your tongue if you want to work with me .
i understand , represent@@ ative .
what would you like me to do ?
pack your bags and get in this car .
and then ?
we 're going to the airport .
don 't forget your pas@@ sport .
why the airport ?
why do you think ? to take a plane , of course !

i hope this will be a comfortable trip for both of you .
do you think i 'll sign a contr@@ act without a contr@@ act fee ?
why don 't you have a contr@@ act fee ?
it 's written right there .
that i will give you the money after i rece@@ ive the invest@@ ment fee .
you know my situation well enough .
then why did you get on the plane ?
because i 'm a vil@@ lager from bus@@ an who has never rid@@ den a plane before .
why ?
what is that for ?
it 's your contr@@ act fee .
there 's nothing more i can do even if you glar@@ e at me .
that 's all i have .
if you can 't trust me , then don 't believe me , believe se@@ j@@ ong ( king on cur@@ ren@@ cy ) .
let me take that .
where is your hotel ?
j@@ ae gu@@ k hotel please .

turn off the lights .
it 's already 8 o '@@ clock .
wake up now .
what kind of writ@@ er sle@@ eps so much ?
being a girl , you grin@@ d your teeth and snor@@ e .
good morning .
the president is waiting .
he 's prepared a y@@ acht and a car .
what kind of a person is cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe that he wants to fully fund the drama production ?
i told you .
he 's a kore@@ an-@@ japan@@ ese business man lo@@ aded with money .
so you 're saying he looked at my script and liked it ?
you wish .
you wouldn 't even be here if i hadn 't fu@@ d@@ ged the fac@@ ts .
what do you mean ? all you 've got is 5 years of experience as an assistant writ@@ er , with no publications , not even a debut experience , not to mention the fact that you were ex@@ communic@@ ated from the field and wast@@ ed 3 years away .
then ...
what did you tell him ?
i told him to meet you in person .
ne qu@@ id nim@@ is ( nothing in exces@@ s ) .
too much fu@@ d@@ ging can back@@ fire .
the only reason he 's invest@@ ing on this project is his trust in me , so don 't make any mist@@ akes and do well ! so don 't make any mist@@ akes and do well !
fine .
he 's a man after all ,
the president has arrived .
this person is the writ@@ er ?
yes , she is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
reading your work brought back long-@@ forgotten memories of my hom@@ eland and my days of youth .
as he read your work , he wondered whether this in@@ experienced ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er would be worth his invest@@ ment .
the whole time i was reading your script , i was so moved by it , that i just had to see the writ@@ er in person .
the whole time he was reading , he saw p@@ lot hol@@ es here and there , but because he trust@@ s produc@@ er anthony he has decided to inv@@ est in our drama .
did you conce@@ ive the idea for the script yourself ?
he asked whether the story was your own idea .
answer him .
though i didn 't experience this pain@@ ful era of our history myself , because she didn 't experience this pain@@ ful era of our history herself ,
i wanted to write about the life of a man whose destiny was ent@@ win@@ ed around that trag@@ ic period .
she had a writ@@ er 's block , but it was fate that led her to a cru@@ cial men@@ tor , which would be me , and i gave her some ad@@ vice and that 's how she was able to finish writing her script .
ah , so anthony kim is the writ@@ er 's sa@@ vi@@ our .
then , i will trust you anthony kim and your writ@@ er .
i will sign a contr@@ act with you .
what did he say ? that based on his trust on the produc@@ er , anthony , he will sign a contr@@ act with us !
really ?
oh , thank you !
( in japan@@ ese ) thank you .
i have one condition though .
thi ... this year ?

for this year , the drama broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been decided , so ... is that it needs to come out within this year . for this year , the drama broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been decided , so ...
do you have a particular reason for wanting it to come out this year ? i can 't tell you that .

the opportunity is already in my hand .
this is my destiny !
born to be the king of dram@@ as , my destiny ! to the people who have mis@@ understood me until this day to the bastar@@ ds that have looked down on me my ear@@ nest sin@@ cer@@ ity with a bloody , migh@@ ty rule ,
i 'll show them ! i 'll get my reven@@ ge !

( in japan@@ ese ) i am fine .
aig@@ oo .
who 's there ?
is someone there ?
( in japan@@ ese ) stop !
( in japan@@ ese ) please ... spar@@ e me ..
( in japan@@ ese ) i won 't do it again ... ever !
the person who break@@ s his promise dies .
just what in the world are you doing ?
it is human nature to break a promise .
but the person who break@@ s his promise to me definitely dies .
who 's there ?
thank you for watching king of dram@@ as with us .
please follow our channel .
have to air it within this year .. !
there 's no question that the big@@ gest productions get sched@@ ul@@ ed first .
people only know k@@ ang hy@@ un min as a big star , but he 's in fact the big@@ gest idiot there is . mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
get up and put your hands up if you don 't want to die .
did you fall for anthony 's decep@@ tions again ?
why don 't you sign a contr@@ act with us ?
we 'll make the best offer ever made to a ro@@ o@@ kie .
do whatever it takes . get her !
episode 3 the return of the king but the person who break@@ s their promise to me definitely dies . who 's there ?
it 's me , ak@@ iko . it 's late , are you not going to sleep ... ? since you weren 't beside me , i couldn 't sleep .
let 's go home . please don 't make any noise . y-@@ you speak kore@@ an ...
i 'm a kore@@ an drama fan . of course , i know some kore@@ an .
could you have possibly heard earlier ... ?
oh , your trans@@ lation with lies ?
don 't worry .
i didn 't say a word to my husband .
were you that surprised ?
my husband doesn 't kill people often , though .
then ... cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe ...
he 's the best yak@@ uza ( gang@@ ster ) in ky@@ us@@ hu area .
wat@@ an@@ abe finance with 40 years of history , he 's the boss of that yak@@ uza .
my husband is a bit har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged and col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , but you don 't know how gentle and tender he is usually .
then ...
then the cha@@ ir@@ man of the wat@@ an@@ abe group is ... of course , it 's a " group . "
you can 't even guess how many " team lead@@ ers " he has .
as long as you keep the promise that you would show us the drama within this year , you won 't die , so don 't worry .
and you asked earlier why the drama must be on tv within this year .
this ... is a secret .
in fact , my husband has the last stage of stomach cancer .
so you must definitely keep your promise !
okay , i know what you 're thinking , but ...
low@@ -@@ grade ...
what do i do ?
should i tell him that i can 't do it now ?
no , how hard it was to get this opportunity ! if i lose this chance , i might not have any chance to come back , not only even in three years but forever !
but life is more important !
i can 't be killed by a yak@@ uza with last@@ -@@ stage stomach cancer !
wouldn 't it be better to tell him that i can 't do this , before it be@@ comes too late ?
what ?
you 've come here and now you say you can 't do it ?
if someone goes back on their word with me they die . whether being killed by a yak@@ uza 's boss , or dying later after fa@@ iling to come back forever , anyway it 's all the same .
i have only one life , so who car@@ es even if i use his money ?
the dice of destiny is already cast anyway .
represent@@ ative !
the japan@@ ese wat@@ an@@ abe group are on the line holding .
good afternoon , mr. tan@@ aka .
i 'm empire productions represent@@ ative oh jin wan .
how are you doing ? about that invest@@ ment you told me about earlier , is it okay to send a script over now ?
yes ?
i 'm sorry .
we have decided to sign with the world production agency .
world production ?
anthony , that jer@@ k !
it 's not like somebody is chas@@ ing us . please , let 's go together .
to put the drama on tv within this year , we have no time to lose , not a second .
within this year ?
yes , broadcasting the drama within this year is the condition of his invest@@ ment .
there are just a few months left this year , how can we get a broadcasting time s@@ lot ?
i can do that , so you 'd better focus on your script now .
the real war is just started from now on .
represent@@ ative , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
the de@@ pos@@ it is wi@@ red to our account .
as if it 's so new to us ..
why aren 't you coming in ?
oh , it 's writ@@ er lee .
you 've seen him before , right ? he 's jo@@ o dong se@@ ok , the produc@@ er .
you 're having lunch .
well , i 'm done now . come over , take a seat .
by the way , where is my desk ?
oh , it 's over there .
here , miss writ@@ er .
okay .
then , where is the room that i 'll be sleeping in ?
it 's over there . show her inside .
huh ?
yes .
over here .
over here , miss writ@@ er .
i 'm done .
represent@@ ative ?
shouldn 't you give me a minimum space so that i can work on my writing ?
what 's wrong ?
you 're not fat , but is that space too small ?
no , i mean , it 's not small , but it 's too l@@ acking ...
it 's too l@@ acking , i agree .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
i rushed to come here , so i couldn 't bring anything .
i heard you got the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe group in japan .
that 's really just amazing !
we were lucky .
and your help was great too , represent@@ ative oh .
what do you mean " lucky " ?
it was sol@@ ely because of your compet@@ ence .
oh , it 's writ@@ er lee .
it 's been a@@ while .
how have you been ?
i thought you two were having a bad connection , but i guess i was wrong .
like me , i thought writ@@ er lee also wished sun@@ ba@@ e 's business to be ru@@ ined , but i was wrong about that too .
like me ?
yes .
three years ago , when the quick@@ -@@ service b@@ iker died .
how could all the details of that accident be on the media mal@@ ic@@ iously ?
why ?
why were all those articles pour@@ ing out without giving us any chance to block them ?
haven 't you doub@@ ted that ?
perhaps ...
you ?
yes .
that ti@@ p-@@ off was done by me .
i mean ... why , you ?
why ?
you don 't know ? for 7 years , under you , i had done all kin@@ ds of work , but although i 'd cle@@ aned up all crap you made , you took all the credit .
did you think i would live forever as the second man of " empire , " the subor@@ din@@ ate of anthony ?
how could you ?
how could ... ?
how dare you ?
!
" how dare ... you ? "
i should be saying that to you .
the represent@@ ative of " empire " now is ...
me .
such a person like you who uses che@@ ap tr@@ icks to make just one drama . a loser like you who hit rock bottom can 't dare to con@@ front me , the most powerful man in drama production industry , the king of the empire is me !
drop that us@@ eless hope , please .
with the invest@@ ment contr@@ act which will become inv@@ ali@@ d if the show can 't be ai@@ red within this year , you can 't fight against me .
there@@ fore , please just stay broken quietly . if you still want to get that tiny bit of respect as sun@@ ba@@ e .
what are you watching so int@@ ently ?
what did i do ?
i 'm just cle@@ aning .
miss writ@@ er lee .
let 's talk for a little bit .
i have something to show you .
this is the writ@@ er 's room prepared by empire production for you , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
earlier , i was a bit too en@@ rag@@ ed , so i said ru@@ de things .
please understand .
why don 't you sign a contr@@ act with us , empire production ?
i signed a contr@@ act with world production 's anthony kim .
how much did you rece@@ ive for that contr@@ act ?
well , the contr@@ act ...
it doesn 't matter .
i don 't think anthony gave you a proper pay@@ ment for the contr@@ act because he came to me to bor@@ row $ 3,000 a few days ago .
and even if you received some , we will pay the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act for you and give you the best condition you can get as a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er . ten million won ( $ 10,000 ) per episode , the advan@@ ce pay@@ ment 100 million won for contr@@ act , and the rest of the pay@@ ment 100 million won , so total 200 million won ( $ 200,000 ) .
are you being like this to me in order to get your reven@@ ge on him ?
if you thought of me as such a small ( pet@@ ty ) person , then i 'm a bit disap@@ pointed .
oh , i heard that the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe of japan was done sol@@ ely because of your script , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
by any chance , were you dece@@ iv@@ ed by anthony , again ?
writ@@ er lee , even if you 're working with anthony , your script won 't be able to be ai@@ red .
as soon as you sign a contr@@ act with us ... well , was it " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
that script will be proce@@ eded right away and be ai@@ red , i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
but ....
this is the key for this apartment .
while staying here , please take your time to consider this offer .
tomorrow afternoon , i will come to see you with the contr@@ act .
don 't forget .
that anthony will never be able to make this drama .
did writ@@ er lee not say where she was going ?
well , when i was back from the rest room , she was already gone .
what about her phone ?
no matter how many times i try , she doesn 't answer her phone . but you know , director . since we got the advan@@ ce de@@ pos@@ it , can 't we have some del@@ icious food ?
our destiny depen@@ ds on how to use that money .
what about the new re@@ cru@@ its ?
they will come to work here by 3 pm .
are you not eating ?
you can eat the rest .
i heard that the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe of japan was done sol@@ ely because of your script , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
by any chance , were you dece@@ iv@@ ed by anthony , again ?
i will give you the best condition you can get as a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
10 million won ( $ 10,000 ) per episode , the advan@@ ce pay@@ ment 100 million won for contr@@ act , and the rest of the pay@@ ment 100 million won , so in total 200 million won ( $ 200,000 ) .
as soon as you sign a contr@@ act with us , that script will be proce@@ eded right away and be ai@@ red , i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
don 't forget . anthony will definitely not be able to make this drama .
mom ?
our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , are you writing the script well ?
by the way , mom , would it be important to keep the promise with a person i can 't trust ?
or would it be more important to choose the gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed future , not keeping that promise ?
is something going on ?
oh no . i 'm just saying .
this child ...
why are you thinking hard about such an easy thing ?
what 's so important about the promise with a person you can 't trust ? the future with the gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed succes@@ s is more important , of course .
i guess so , right ?
of course !
aun@@ tie ! please give the food quickly !
i 'm busy right now so i will call you later okay ?
alright .
this person is un@@ avail@@ able right now .
the signal is on , but she 's not picking up the phone .
anyway , i sent a text message that we will have a meeting at 3@@ pm today , so she will come by then .
director ?
we 're ready to have the meeting .
writ@@ er lee ?
miss writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
thank you for giving me such a good opportunity , but i wish my drama would be made to give hope to everyone , not to step on someone .
i can 't take this opportunity by breaking a promise .
i 'm sorry .
my first script , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be made by world production as promised .
we couldn 't even contact you . what in the world happened ?
i 'm late only by 3 minutes .
what ?
are you saying you ignored the calls on purpose ?
well , my friend told me to stay at her apartment if i don 't have any place to stay , so i went there ... you went there , and ... ? it looked great outside , but even the cell phone didn 't work there , and it was too lux@@ ur@@ ious for me to stay there .
the place where people live should be more hum@@ ane , don 't you think so ?
as promised , i sent the contr@@ act pay@@ ment to your account , so check it later .
hurry up and go in . everyone is waiting for you .
what do we do ?
what do we do ?
call writ@@ er je@@ ong .
what ?
" eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " will be ai@@ red this year .
for that , park shin yang ( a famous kore@@ an actor ) is going to take the main role next year ...
we can do the casting again .
director .
don 't you understand what i 'm saying ?
call a meeting immediately .
yes , sir .
this is han k@@ ang wo@@ ok , who new@@ ly joined world production as a produc@@ er .
yes , nice to meet you . yes .
he 's good at the produc@@ er work but not good at family matters , so he divor@@ ced two years ago .
and here is team leader park se@@ ok hy@@ un for finance .
i 'm still single , no need to worry about being divor@@ ced .
he 's single , no chance to get married , so don 't care about him .
and here is go@@ o yi j@@ ae , the young@@ est staff for er@@ rand@@ s .
please take care of me !
i 'm go@@ o yi j@@ ae of production team .
and this is ...
yes !
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
please take care of me !
so now we 've done our introduc@@ tions . everyone here who will share the destiny with our world production , as you can see , the level of our office is on the ground .
but ... remember this ...
the bank account with 67@@ 0,000 won ( $ 670 ) and this small , hum@@ ble office are the ground we will new@@ ly start , but with the advan@@ ce de@@ pos@@ it 100 million won , up there , we 'll head to the top . to do that , what you will do from now on is to win the broadcasting sched@@ ule so that this drama can be ai@@ red within this year .
ai@@ red within this year ?
air@@ ing it within this year is the condition for the invest@@ ment .
the rest of the invest@@ ment fund of 9.@@ 9 bil@@ lion won , a total of 10 bil@@ lion won ( $ 10 million ) worth drama , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
definitely needs to be ai@@ red within this year .
what will happen if it can 't be ai@@ red within this year ?
we die . cur@@ r@@ ently for mon@@ day and tu@@ es@@ day of the k broadcasting station ( impl@@ ying k@@ bs ) , " days of passion " is being ai@@ red now , and after this , a histor@@ ic drama with 50 episodes is planned . for wed@@ nes@@ day and thur@@ s@@ day , " heaven " with 20 episodes , and after this , the drama of director je@@ ong se@@ ong chan is planned , so this year 's broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been complet@@ ed .
what about m broadcasting ( impl@@ ying mb@@ c ) ? m broadcasting has already complet@@ ed it 's broadcasting sched@@ ule for this year , and the place which has the time room for this year is only november for mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day of s broadcasting ( impl@@ ying s@@ bs ) .
" top secrets ... "
wasn 't it casting the actor choi ta@@ e jo@@ on ?
this early morning , ta@@ e jo@@ on had a big accident during the first shooting , so he needs to rest for 8 week .
if he needs 8 weeks , the shooting will be cancel@@ ed soon .
yes . the media is talking about his " dis@@ playing the fighting spirit for the drama " in real time , but we should consider that his drama is actually going to be cancel@@ ed .
then , are you saying they 're rele@@ asing the fal@@ se information to the media ?
for the production company , they 've already lost hund@@ reds of million won , so we can say they are making a fran@@ tic last@@ -@@ dit@@ ch effort . for the actor , since he can 't keep acting for the drama , he 's just trying to main@@ tain his image , that 's all .
then the remained spot is only november for s broadcasting ...
fine .
make a list of ac@@ tors in their 30 's who can play for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ai@@ red in november .
let 's go with november , s broadcasting .
represent@@ ative !
even so , broadcasting it in november is ...
november in this year at s broadcasting .
this is the matter of life or death of our empire production .
no matter what it takes , we must get that time s@@ lot ! since the top ac@@ tors in our company are not avail@@ able anyway , make a list for top ac@@ tors of other compan@@ ies and call the meeting again .
the meeting is starting again .
tell them i 'll be there soon .
why did you come back again ?
huh ?
why did you come back again , not going to oh jin wan ?
how did you know ... ? you make a lot of fus@@ s for even a small matter , but you were out of reach after going out to dum@@ p gar@@ b@@ age , and came back one day later .
more@@ over , right after oh jin wan vis@@ ited .
and then saying all the non@@ sense about a friend and the lux@@ ur@@ ious apartment or what@@ not .
did you think i would fall for your lam@@ e acting ?
i guess the lux@@ ur@@ ious apartment part must be true . oh jin wan , not your friend , showed it to you , though .
why ?
why did you come back to me ?
is the reason really that important ?
it 's not that important , but i 'm very curious .
people like you wouldn 't understand , but there are princip@@ les and prom@@ ises to some people .
and there are some people who live to keep those things even if they don 't have much .
i just kept them , that 's all .
how grateful i am .
it 's not for your sake .
of course it 's for mine .
so it wasn 't anything special .
and i 've told you before .
it 's not " you . " it 's " represent@@ ative . "
s
k
k
m since you came from the movie industry , if i make an ex@@ ample in that side , if you made a movie , you need to release it through movie theat@@ ers .
yes .
but in our field , there are only three theat@@ ers .
so-@@ called " 3 compan@@ ies of ground-@@ wave . "
if you can 't get the time s@@ lot through these three , the drama production itself is impossible , far from rele@@ asing part .
then , the competition to get the time s@@ lot must be really fier@@ ce .
that 's right .
but the golden time for a drama is 10@@ pm !
the number of the drama production compan@@ ies which are desperately trying to get that time s@@ lot is 248 , coun@@ ting only kore@@ an compan@@ ies . even if we count only three writ@@ ers per each company , 248 by 3 .. 3 by 8 is 24 , and .... 248 by 3 .. 3 by 8 is 24 , and ....
it 's 7@@ 44 : 1 .
so , if we think about it 's probabil@@ ity ....
don 't you have the calcul@@ ator ?
0.@@ 134 % .
it 's just 0.1 % , no need to round it up .
you will see with your own eyes from now on how hard it is to get the time s@@ lot .
let 's start the casting .
yes , sir . yes , sir .
exclu@@ ding the ac@@ tors who bel@@ ong to our empire production , these are the ac@@ tors who can play for the drama which will be ai@@ red in november .
lee je@@ ong shi@@ k and oh ta@@ e ye@@ on , do you think they can be the top ( main role ) ?
exclu@@ de them .
re@@ move je@@ ong do jin too . he can be the top for a daily so@@ ap opera , but he doesn 't have the mask for a mini-@@ series .
about cha se@@ ung hy@@ un ....
isn 't he going to film a movie in dec@@ ember ?
cha se@@ ung hy@@ un can 't work with us because of the movie .
who do you think would be okay for the main role , writ@@ er lee ?
while writing the script , haven 't you considered any among these guys ?
how about yo@@ o ha ye@@ on ?
i think he 's the most similar one to the main role 's image .
he 's not good because he 's a jun@@ kie .
i heard he quit last year .
the most un@@ reli@@ able words in the world is that a jun@@ kie says he quit the drug and the gam@@ e-@@ ad@@ dic@@ t says he quit gamb@@ ling .
even so , he 's one of the top three in korea . that 's true , but although the new@@ sp@@ aper didn 't report it yet , the pro@@ secu@@ tor 's office already finished it 's intern@@ al investig@@ ation , so there is a ru@@ mor they would blow it right before the presidenti@@ al election .
tell him to blow the lunch box bom@@ b by himself .
how about se@@ o ta@@ e ha , director ?
but would he want to play the role for a " reven@@ ge " drama again ?
he has a sever@@ e depression issue , so as far as i know , he has been getting therap@@ y for months .
what a mor@@ on ...
acting must be done by acting ...
next actor .
is depression a sin ?
well ... i didn 't mean that , but ...
then should we go with se@@ o ta@@ e ha ?
ah , forget it .
who else is left ?
kim jin ho and k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
kim jin wo@@ o has a lot of female fans .
he 's very hot now , not only in korea but also in other coun@@ tries .
not only s broadcasting , but also all three stations can 't res@@ ist him .
let 's go with kim jin wo@@ o , represent@@ ative .
not him .
now what ?
if i say no , then no .
well do you have a reason to say no ?
you don 't need to know .
why are you leaving kim jin wo@@ o out and going with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why on earth are you saying we need to go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ? " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 , " november at s broadcasting , let 's go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min for its male main .
prepare for that .
yes .
excuse me , director heo ..
it has been only for a short while since you were s@@ cou@@ ted to our empire after staying in the u.s. for years .
so i guess you don 't know well , so that 's why i 'm telling you this .
kim jin wo@@ o really hat@@ es anthony .
why ?
back in the day , anthony st@@ ole kim jin wo@@ o 's woman .
so what ?
what does that have to do with us ?
of course it has something to do , with our represent@@ ative . among top ac@@ tors , kim jin wo@@ o and k@@ ang hy@@ un min who can be used for november , the one anthony can sel@@ ect is only k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
this fight can be defin@@ ed as the total war between anthony , who will put his life on the line to have k@@ ang hy@@ un min for the casting , and our represent@@ ative oh .
cur@@ r@@ ently , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is considering " getting married to my man , " and ...
by the writ@@ er g@@ ong ji young ?
represent@@ ative , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is doing a fan meeting at the diamond hall of ace hotel .
it ends at 5 o '@@ clock .
prepare a clean copy of the script . i 'm taking off .
yes .
what are you doing ?
i 'm making myself en@@ grave him in my mind . that way he can be alive in the script .
so have you en@@ grav@@ ed him well ?
the more i think about it , the more i like it .
he looks intellig@@ ent , with an air of melan@@ chol@@ y about him .
once you see him in person , you 'll find out in less than a minute how intellig@@ ent and melan@@ chol@@ ic he is .
what ...
you raise me up , so i can stand on mountains .
you raise me up to walk on stor@@ my se@@ as .
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be
you raise me up to more than i can be
long time no see !
yes , hello .
you should be holding fan@@ me@@ et@@ ings in japan and china besides this crow@@ ded seoul .
so i should .
i have a good drama in the mak@@ ings , you should work with me .
you 're still making dram@@ as these days ?
i got an invest@@ ment of 10 bil@@ lion won from japan .
good for you .
i 'll get the november broadcasting s@@ lot at s broadcasting .
i did hear that ta@@ e jo@@ on has been seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
i guess he couldn 't get up this time .
i 'll cut to the chase . this is my offer .
the best rate in the nation , 100 million won per episode .
100 million ?
20 episodes , so 2 bil@@ lion . once you sign the contr@@ act , you 'll be paid the total amount within 15 days .
yes ?
the total amount ?
i gu@@ aran@@ tee you the qu@@ ality of the drama .
more@@ over , as it 's being fun@@ ded by a japan@@ ese source , we can even try for a national broad@@ cast in japan .
then ...
it 's the birth of a new hal@@ ly@@ u star .
you 'll be rolling in dou@@ gh . to tell it like it is ,
i know that you need big money for the shopping mal@@ l business that you started beyond your means .
if you just sign the document you get 2 bil@@ lion .
what about the script ?
have a good look at it and meet me at the restaurant at the che@@ ong@@ dam inter@@ section .
i 'll do that .
read it fast , but pay attention .
it 's a vou@@ cher worth 2 bil@@ lion .
you 're really cool , represent@@ ative .
but do you think k@@ ang hy@@ un min will come there ?
there is one thing people know about k@@ ang hy@@ un min and one thing they don 't .
although they know that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a star , they don 't know that he 's the world 's big@@ gest idiot who only knows money .
he will come without question .
i 'm going !
i , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , am getting 2 bil@@ lion and going to the world !
go to hollywood , let 's go par@@ ty@@ time .
kw@@ ang so@@ o , turn it up !
empire 's represent@@ ative oh jin wan hey turn it off !
yes , represent@@ ative oh .
hello !
i 've heard that you were being bo@@ thered by some pa@@ the@@ tic scrip@@ ts lat@@ ely .
i 'm calling to disper@@ se your wor@@ ries a bit .
we 're planning to do je@@ ong hong ju 's project , how about it ?
if it 's writ@@ er je@@ ong hong ju ...
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ?
wasn 't shin yang hy@@ ung going to do that ?
it 's empire 's best drama , of course we have to go with korea 's best actor .
oh my god .
aren 't you just asking me because shin yang refused it ?
what are you talking about ?
to me , the best actor in korea is always k@@ ang hy@@ un min , no question about it .
please send the script , then .
in any case , it 's writ@@ er je@@ ong hong ju who can turn everything to gold .
that gu@@ aran@@ tees the qu@@ ality of the work .
what month is the broad@@ cast ?
november . at s broadcasting .
november at s broadcasting ?
why ?
no , it 's nothing .
ah , right .
you know the guy called anthony , don 't you ?
by anthony you mean ... ah , the person who was at empire in the past .
it looks like he 's trying to start again with a japan@@ ese invest@@ ment of 10 bil@@ lion .
didn 't he come look for you ?
no , he didn 't .
ah ...
i heard there 's a problem with the japan@@ ese contr@@ act .
at any rate , i 'll send the contr@@ act to your agency .
give me a call when you make up your mind .
i understand , have a good day .
yes !
dang , now i 'm confused .
hey , hurry up and turn around .
huh ?
hy@@ ung , what about the char@@ ity event for senior cit@@ iz@@ ens ?
listen , it 's a matter of bil@@ lions of money .
i can care less about those senior cit@@ iz@@ ens !
just turn around , now !
man , i 'm so confused .
anthony ...
i see that he got to talk to k@@ ang hy@@ un min before i did ...
what do you think ?
what did you think , hy@@ ung ? darling , if i had the br@@ ains to tell whether a script is good or not , would i ask you ?
i really like it .
i 've never seen any drama like this before .
it 's re@@ fresh@@ ing .
is it .. ?
but hy@@ ung , shouldn 't you be talking to the represent@@ ative ?
don 't worry , i can talk to him after making up my mind .
telling them too soon will only cause head@@ aches .
then , hy@@ ung , what are you going to do ?
this one or the empire 's ?
well ... honestly ...
i like this , but ... but i 'm not sure if anthony really got fun@@ ding from a japan@@ ese source or if he 's blu@@ ff@@ ing ...
hy@@ ung , if it 's not certain isn 't it better to go with empire ?
empire .
empire .
empire .
gos@@ h , this gives me a head@@ ache .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's manager just called .
his high@@ school teacher died , so he had to go to the funeral .
so he can 't come here today .
it 's oh jin wan .
par@@ don ?
the empire has tar@@ get@@ ed k@@ ang hy@@ un min and played some tr@@ icks .
se@@ on@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
it 's me .
i see that you talked to hy@@ un min already .
what the ...
why are you so ob@@ ses@@ sed with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why do you think i 'm doing this ?
do you think i really like that idiot who can 't even write his own name in chinese ?
his voice is pa@@ the@@ tic , he thinks acting is all about pos@@ ing , he 's such a stuck@@ -up who 's crazy about money .
why would i be ob@@ ses@@ sed with him ?
i 'm just ... using him to destroy you , se@@ on@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
is this ... a challenge ?
the one sitting on the thr@@ one of the empire is me .
and as long as i 'm empire 's represent@@ ative , you definitely won 't be able to make a come@@ back .
represent@@ ative , it 's a bad news !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min , confir@@ med casting for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2
seeing that they 've already publ@@ ished news articles about casting k@@ ang hy@@ un min for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 , i guess the empire has already taken action .
find out where k@@ ang min hy@@ ung is .
right now .
yes .
i 'm going to k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's house .
what are you doing ?
aren 't you going to see that intellig@@ ent actor with an air of melan@@ chol@@ y ?
me too ?
since we don 't have a director yet , we should at least introdu@@ ce the ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er to him .
should i go ?
where on earth do you think he went ?
that 's what i want to ask now .
yes ?
we found him , director .
today is an actor kim jin wo@@ o 's birthday and everyone is inside a vi@@ p room drinking alcohol .
thank you , thank you !
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
thanks .
hey . you 're really made the right choice . i just came back from china after film@@ ing some drama there , but anthony , that son of b * * ch , is acting up to come back , i guess .
he can 't come back . he 's a jer@@ k you should never work with .
why do you not like that guy ?
you don 't have to know that far .
it 's not just one or two people who hate anthony in this field .
oh , that 's right . thinking of that , the girl you dat@@ ed with a few years ago , anthony took her away from you , right ?
who did that ?
got it ? okay !
che@@ ers .
it 's been a long time .
wow , indeed , i can 't win over you , represent@@ ative kim .
want a drink ?
we should do introduc@@ tions .
this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , the writ@@ er of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong . "
hello .
director , you really ...
this there a reason for me to meet this person ?
how much do you want ?
did you not see the article ?
i will give you more ( money ) than empire . how much do you want ?
represent@@ ative , i 've decided to work for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 . "
okay , fine .
you can trust empire production .
but , you 'd better not trust oh jin wan of empire production .
what on earth is the reason that you 're so ob@@ ses@@ sed for k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why would i be ?
do you think i 'm doing this because i like that guy who is too ignor@@ ant to write his own name in chinese charac@@ ters ?
he has terrible vocal , and thinks his acting is the best .
that ru@@ de jer@@ k who is crazy about only money , why would i ob@@ s@@ ess about him ?
i 'm just ... using him to destroy you , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
hey , you guys , leave us alone .
i 'm going crazy ... represent@@ ative oh , that son of b * * ch !
ge@@ ez , how embarras@@ sing !
are you insan@@ e ?
did you have to turn it on in front of those guys ?
are you going to do it or not ?
i 'll do it .
but will just ask you something .
why are you two like that to each other ?
i will tell you tru@@ th@@ fully .
this is the war between me and oh jin wan of empire production .
and you 're now on board of my ship .
the war . it 's already started . during the first shooting of " top secrets , " the drama which was planned to be ai@@ red in november , because of some accident of choi ta@@ e jo@@ on , the main actor , he was re@@ commen@@ ded to have 8 weeks of rest and he 's now getting treated at the hospital .
production team for this drama decided that no more shooting is possible .
so the drama " top secrets " is cancel@@ ed . as for its re@@ placement drama , we 're looking into all possible op@@ tions with op@@ en-@@ mind , but so far , there is nothing decided yet .
director ! there is a ru@@ mor that " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " will re@@ place that , but is it true ?
please tell us more !
is it true that writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o 's drama will be ai@@ red ?
then , what is the best among those op@@ tions ?
director , it 's of course " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of empire production .
it seems that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is in the casting . well , it 's not like he has signed a contr@@ act , and there is only its title , not even the syno@@ p@@ sis , so how can we say if it 's good or bad ?
cp na , how could say that ?
if writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o heard that , she would 've been upset .
what na moon young said isn 't totally wrong .
even if it 's je@@ ong hong jo@@ o from empire , we don 't have to beg her first .
then , what 's the best among the dram@@ as with scrip@@ ts ? well , considering only the drama itself , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong " is the best .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is going to work with me for my drama .
yes , reporter park .
i 've met him in this morning and finished all the discus@@ sion .
he 's on bad ter@@ ms with his represent@@ ative , so he even asked me ( for this role ) .
what do you mean , empire ?
hy@@ un min said he hasn 't even met anyone from empire . [ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , didn 't even meet production team for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " ]
will he play in a drama which doesn 't even have a script ? [ will k@@ ang hy@@ un min play for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ? - no script is made yet . ]
that 's right , he said it was just one of all dram@@ as he was looking into .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min ' eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ' cast " no ! " ]
director !
right now k@@ ang hy@@ un min@@ -
so you 're trying to do some media play ?
in real time , the re@@ fut@@ ation news is being up@@ lo@@ aded .
what shall we do ?
what shall we do ?
contact the represent@@ ative of his agency .
aig@@ oo , seriously !
hey !
how could you decide such important matter without me ?
if you discus@@ s with me , will i take more commission from you ?
hy@@ un min , it 's empire , empire !
do you want to fight against represent@@ ative oh and finish your actor 's life ?
a@@ igo , seriously , you br@@ at .
hy@@ un min ! damn ! i 've lost my face in front of my friends , but if i work with repr@@ ent@@ ative oh , those guys will think of me a mor@@ on !
i will make represent@@ ative oh apologi@@ ze to you !
do you want him to apologi@@ ze in front of all those guys ?
oh , i don 't know !
i don 't know , i don 't know !
director oh a@@ igo , i could barely persu@@ ade hy@@ un min .
yes .
please don 't worry .
all those articles which anthony released are now removed .
i 've just received that report .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , recon@@ fir@@ med to act for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " ]
so , who finally got hold of k@@ ang hy@@ un min , repr@@ ent@@ ative oh or anthony ?
well , i can 't figure it out , either .
there are even some articles which dis@@ appear if you cl@@ ick them .
but if you go to some other sites , again you can find ... tell both of them to come to my office immediately .
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , i think i clearly warned you .
then , i will war@@ n you too .
i got k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
haven 't you seen all those articles getting removed weak@@ ly ?
i 'll get to the point . whether bringing the contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min to me , or bringing hy@@ un min in front of me , bring me something firm .
director , are you now doub@@ ting about me because of anthony 's media play ?
i 'm the represent@@ ative of empire .
represent@@ ative oh . even if you 're the represent@@ ative of empire production , the drama director here is me !
as you want , director , i will bring k@@ ang hy@@ un min in front of you . anthony , there is no one who would fall for your words , so just make sure to bring him .
by 11 am tomorrow , before our meeting for broadcasting sched@@ ule , bring k@@ ang hy@@ un min in front of me .
the person who br@@ ings k@@ ang hy@@ un min tomorrow will be the ow@@ ner of november time s@@ lot .
the number you called is busy now .
the number you called is busy now .
pd jo@@ o , what about k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
represent@@ ative choi , what about k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
what ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is under water ? ( impl@@ ying " hiding without any contact detail " )
even without road manager kw@@ ang so@@ o , he 's been out of reach for 8 hours .
out of reach ?
have you search@@ ed all possible places ?
are you sure he went under water ?
if k@@ ang hy@@ un min went under water , he wouldn 't go where he usually goes .
from now on , anyone who is close to hy@@ un min , whether it 's an actor , or a manager , find those people who are staying home today and visit all those houses .
their hom@@ es ?
don 't you know that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a video game ad@@ dic@@ t ?
you 're his road manager , but what did you do , not st@@ icking to hy@@ un min ?
well , i went to the rest room , but when i came back , he was gone ...
i 'm sorry .
where do you think he will possibly go ?
he 's not at j@@ ang ge@@ un se@@ ok 's house .
what about your side ?
he 's not at ji sung 's house , either . as k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's cell phone is still turned on , i was going to ask yo@@ on g@@ ye sang 's help , thinking he might answer to his call , but g@@ ye sang s@@ si isn 't not ans@@ wering my call .
i 've already tried that meth@@ od .
cell phone .... ?
i 've already tried that meth@@ od .
cell phone .... ?
long time no see , detective lee .
so you want us to track down the location of k@@ ang hy@@ un min using his cell phone ?
yes , that bastard 's cell phone is on .
you know , that 's il@@ legal .
i know it 's il@@ legal . that 's why i 'm asking you .
hello professor , this is lee go e@@ un .
i talked to you before about doing some background research for a drama . actually , there is something i 'm not quite clear about , actually , there is something i 'm not quite clear about , so i was wondering if i could meet with you again .
yes , mor@@ n@@ ings are fine with me .
of course .
then i 'll see you at the school .
thanks .
that k@@ ang hy@@ un min bastard , maybe he 's passed out somewhere drunk on purpose to anno@@ y us .
on purpose ?
would he have taken his game consol@@ e if he did it on purpose ?
how do you know that he took his game consol@@ e with him ?
well , actually , the thing is ...
just sp@@ it it out !
he said he 'd fire me if i talked !
i 'm your emplo@@ yer !

just wait a sec !
hey , lady !
represent@@ ative , i 'm here .

there is a car in the garage , so he must be inside ...
writ@@ er lee ?
what happened ?
what 's wrong ?
answer me , lee go e@@ un ! writ@@ er lee ? what happened ?
swe@@ ethe@@ art ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , i 'm from the world production .
you saw me the other day .
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
how did she know that i 'm here ?
i know you 're in there .
open the door !
man , i 've seen it already .
i saw what you were doing with that act@@ ress . i can spread the news !
i mean it !
just open the door !
who in their right mind would open the door when hiding ?
ye@@ e-@@ ha !
stop , stop !
i got you !
hold still !
you want to die ?
i 've got to get dressed !
if you don 't want to die , get up and lift up your hands . you , do you even know what kind of a gun that is ?
are you crazy ?
sure . i 'm completely crazy .
so you should get out of here if you want to live .
i 'd rather die than go out like this . lady , i have a wife and children .
i 'll give you back your money .
i don 't need it .
just spar@@ e me !
you just pay attention to the road !
yes , represent@@ ative .
i 'm on my way with mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
where ?
what ?
where ?
writ@@ er lee ?
writ@@ er lee !
let go ! let go of it !
i can 't die like this !
ah !
hey !
just turn the volume down already !
what an idiot !
writ@@ er lee ! lee go e@@ un , what happened ? !
let go !
i said , let go !
i can 't let you go !
threaten@@ ing with an um@@ bre@@ lla isn 't enough ?
let go !
if you don 't come with me , we can 't produce our drama !
what 's that got to do with me ?
do you really think you can make me come with you ?
just listen to me for once , then i 'll let you go .
what ?
i know that only you can make up your mind . that you call the sho@@ ts .
but just keep this in mind .
i will try my best to show how ser@@ o@@ ius , how mar@@ vel@@ ous of an actor you are .
that 's why you 're just a ro@@ o@@ kie . all the writ@@ ers write for me , the protagon@@ ist , the very k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
understand ?
yes , it 's me .
how did it go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
we 're bringing him with us .
just wait for a little while .
great ! represent@@ ative , even if neither of them get k@@ ang hy@@ un min , empire productions has far better conditions .
that 's correct .
plus , represent@@ ative oh is bringing k@@ ang hy@@ un min right now .
well then , it 's pretty much decided .
then , the mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day s@@ lot for dram@@ as in november shall go to the empire production 's eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ...
what are you doing ?
par@@ don me .
how dare you bar@@ ge in ? !
get out !
my name is k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i 'll do my best .
it 's not over yet .
i 'll turn the tables when they least expect it .
does living like that make you happy at all ?
in this world , those with power op@@ press the lo@@ ser@@ s .
the broad@@ cast sched@@ ule report is not avail@@ able ?
bring me the bank statement with proof of fun@@ ds for the production .
if you can only produce it by co@@ vering everything up with money , i don 't want that .
why don 't you step down ?
i mean , i 'm fir@@ ing you .
leave .
episode 4 the@@ ar@@ to@@ f war alright , i understand . represent@@ ative ,
anthony did end up with the broadcasting s@@ lot . k@@ ang hy@@ un min is with anthony right now . represent@@ ative oh , i 'm truly sorry .
this is so not like hy@@ un min ... why would he do this ? why would he ... ?
represent@@ ative choi , do you think that that is a vali@@ d excuse ?
don 't ever expect to see me again .
represent@@ ative , represent@@ ative !
i didn 't mean ...
represent@@ ative !
wow , seriously ...
i can 't win with you , represent@@ ative .
you even sent people all the way there to track me down .
this is incredi@@ ble !
at any rate , why did you change your mind all of a sudden ?
why did i change my mind ? from now on , i will write only for you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min . i will do my best to show in my writing what an ear@@ nest , pr@@ ais@@ e@@ wor@@ thy actor you are .
that 's why you 're just a ro@@ o@@ kie . all the other writ@@ ers are already doing it . writing for the protagon@@ ist , the star , me .
understand ?
by the way , did you mean it ?
what ?
that you will write for me .
that you will try to prove what an aw@@ esome actor i am .
do you really mean that ?
of course !
then listen .
if you don 't keep that promise , you 'll be in big trouble .
understand ?
yes .
i think you are mist@@ ak@@ en .
my decision has always been the same .
i just went away to study the script .
there was no need for such a fus@@ s .
so we were pan@@ icking for nothing .
i 'm a man of my word .
how can a man ever change his word ?
by the way , represent@@ ative .
about that writ@@ er , what kind of a person is she ?
does she stay true to her words ? represent@@ ative , as we had origin@@ ally planned , let 's s@@ late eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 for next year ...
it 's not over yet . director heo , go ahead with our prepar@@ ations .
yes . anthony , just wait for a little bit .
i will turn the tables on you when you least expect it .
have you lost your mind completely ?
hey , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ! no matter how good@@ -@@ looking you are , it doesn 't take much to lose your shine in this field .
if you 're going to call all the sho@@ ts at your w@@ him , do you even need me ?
are you suggest@@ ing that you don 't need me any more ?
that 's right .
to be honest , i don 't need you any more . whether i 'm good@@ -@@ looking or not , it 's thanks to me that you 're making money .
tell me , is it not ?
hy@@ un min , what i mean is ... if that 's not what you mean , just shut your mouth .
also , since i pro@@ cu@@ red this contr@@ act , i 'm not giving you a single penny for it .
got it ?
g@@ wang so@@ o , let 's go .
yes .
ar@@ gh , that ras@@ cal ... !
hy@@ ung , each time i see this team , they just brigh@@ ten my day .
aig@@ oo , she pl@@ ays co@@ y ...
no matter how you sl@@ ice it , when it comes to looks , our bit na is the best .
yes , her looks are the best .
bit na , is something wrong ?
i don 't know , i 'm just pissed .
why , why ?
even at our last concert , they wouldn 't let me say anything to the audience !
who the he@@ ck did that ? chief go , saying that if fans hear my voice , they will be completely put off .
that stupid chief go needs to learn a les@@ son .
what 's wrong with our bit na 's voice ?
it 's unique and sexy !
i don 't know !
bit na , you wanted a new car , right ?
why ?
i 'll buy you one .
a nice one .
are you serious ?
i 've got a big pay@@ ment coming in .
then i 'll buy you one .
op@@ pa ... i la la , i love you !
i suppose all your experience coun@@ ts for something , seeing that you managed to bring in k@@ ang hy@@ un min when the empire failed to do that .
you know , once i target an actor , i never let go .
i was wondering if you had lost your touch since you weren 't doing so well for 3 years .
so , what about the script ?
working on episode 5 now .
she 's done pretty well so far for someone without any publications or awards .
yes , indeed .
however , that ends here .
let her finish what she 's working on .
then switch to a more se@@ as@@ oned writ@@ er .
what ?
need@@ less to say , the production will go live soon enough .
you can 't do that with a new@@ bie like that .
i heard that all she 's got is some experience as an assistant to writ@@ er je@@ ong . is that right ?
yes , that is correct , but ...
just get a different writ@@ er .
i 'm telling you this as the director of the broadcasting station .
represent@@ ative , you 're back .
you 're back .
what 's all this ?
oh , represent@@ ative , you 're back .
why are you in such a good mood ?
my mom is here .
represent@@ ative , how have you been ? how have you been ? since my go e@@ un wasn 't coming home for nights working on the script ,
i 've come to make sure that you 're fe@@ eding her well . oh , mother ( of go e@@ un ) , you should come often .
the food is so good .
hadn 't had a hom@@ e-@@ cook@@ ed meal in a long time .
exactly , mother .
you should have some , too , represent@@ ative .
i have e@@ aten already .
oh , how fortun@@ ate that i pack@@ ed some extra .
keep it in the fri@@ dge so that represent@@ ative can have it later .
alright .
is my daughter doing alright ?
yes .
i trust you to take good care of her .
i shall excuse myself now .
have a safe trip back .
mom , you 're leaving already ?
yes , it 's already late for me to get ready for the evening rush .
i 'll see my mom to the bus station .
writ@@ er lee !
yes ?
i need to talk with you , why don 't you say goodbye now ?
yes ?
that 's right .
you just stay here and talk with him . i 'll get a taxi .
- bye , and please come again .
- thanks for the food !
what is it ?
i will cut to the chase .
in ad@@ dition to the contr@@ act fee , i 'll give you a bonus , so 30 million won ( ~ $ 30@@ k in usd ) in total .
yes ?
what does that mean ... ?
i would like you to step down now .
what do you mean by that ?
i 'm fir@@ ing you .
so leave .
on what gro@@ unds ?
if you want to know , i 'll tell you .
i used you to get the invest@@ ment , and now that i don 't need you , i 'm deser@@ ting you .
you asked me if i wanted to spend the rest of my life gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els .
seemed like your mac@@ ker@@ el business is going well , that 's not a bad way of spen@@ ding the rest of your life .
- you said , dreams ex@@ ist to be ful@@ filled , not remin@@ is@@ ced .
- i lied to convince you ... you can 't tell me to leave .
it 's my writing !
my baby !
i 'm sorry , but we 've already found a new writ@@ er .
what a s@@ cum .
yes , maybe not the world 's low@@ est , but the low@@ est s@@ cum in korea for sure .
so leave . i can 't !
i won 't !
i 'd rather die !
i 'll go to the drama department and tell them all about what a s@@ cum you are .
you would better not do that .
you 'll only face the reality of how pa@@ the@@ tic you are .
what ?
it was the drama department that asked for a new writ@@ er .
hey , you there !
hey ! hey !
we 'll have to see when the first draft ....
what , what is this ?
i am writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
so what ?
i know that i 'm being ru@@ de , but i just had to ask a question .
i just heard from the production company that they 're getting a new writ@@ er .
they said that a new writ@@ er was re@@ quest@@ ed by the drama department . is that true ?
yes , it is .
i know i 'm a ro@@ o@@ kie , with no publication or broadcasting experience .
however , didn 't you give us the s@@ lot based on my writing ?
please , give me a chance .
do you have any idea where you are ?
director ...
you said it yourself .
that you have no publications or broadcasting experience . as the final person in charge , i 'm telling you as the director of the drama department .
we can 't let a ro@@ o@@ kie with no publication or broadcasting experience go out to war .
it is better off not to start a war when defe@@ at is evi@@ dent .
then , i 'm ... in a nut@@ shell , as long as you 're not in the team , this war can be won .
if i 've made myself clear , go now .
if ... if i leave , can you gu@@ aran@@ tee that this war will be won ?
what ?
you probably can 't .
nobody knows for sure .
you can only exc@@ el if given an opportunity .
even if i have to leave the production , i just wanted to say this to you .
what the ... what a br@@ at ... how insol@@ ent ...
she may be fe@@ ist@@ y , but she 's right .
huh , what ?
yes ?
what did you just say ?
no , just ramb@@ ling . represent@@ ative , are you asleep ?
speak .
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ... will she be alright ?
she seemed to be in a lot of shock .
forget about it and just sleep .
i 'm trying , but i can 't sleep .
what did i tell you ?
to make a drama ...
one must leave even if it is his own father .
yes , so keep that in mind and sleep .
tomorrow , we 'll get the contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ready .
yes .
aun@@ ty , can you hurry up a bit ?
alright !
what are you doing ?
g@@ wang so@@ o , stop .
you 're here .
i told you to work out , not to show yourself off working out .
they 're all dying to see me though .
all these girls have come here to see this face and this body .
i guess it doesn 't hurt to sign the contr@@ act among flowers .
the ter@@ ms are as we had discus@@ sed before . as soon as you sign the contr@@ act , you 'll get 2 bil@@ lion won in 15 days , all in one lum@@ p sum .
g@@ wang so@@ o , my stam@@ p .
let 's break a leg !
just de@@ pos@@ it the money within the set time .
what do you mean ?
you can 't issue a certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot ?
we 've already signed a contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and changed the writ@@ er . you can 't issue a certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot ? we 've already signed a contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and changed the writ@@ er .
why can 't you issue us a certific@@ ate when you 've already given us the s@@ lot ?
who says i 'm not issu@@ ing you one ?
bring me the bank statement that has the fun@@ ds for this production .
what ?
not something you just type up on word , but an actual bank book that shows the money .
director ...
you know it , too .
how many drama productions bite off more than they can che@@ w , and end up in a w@@ rec@@ k with in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent fun@@ ds .
that hur@@ ts the reputation of the broadcasting station as well !
once you give me the certific@@ ate , i get the invest@@ ment from japan .
not just a couple bil@@ lion , but 10 bil@@ lion !
well then , show me the bank book with that 10 bil@@ lion .
director ...
a certific@@ ate of a broadcasting s@@ lot comes with my official se@@ al to re@@ present the broadcasting station .
if you want my se@@ al , show me the money first .
we have to de@@ pos@@ it the 2 bil@@ lion for k@@ ang hy@@ un min , too . what now ?
if he doesn 't get that 2 bil@@ lion , he 'll go with someone else for sure .
then , the whole drama is ..
what if we explained our situation to the japan@@ ese spon@@ sor ?
i 've already contac@@ ted the person in charge , it 's the same story .
an official document of the broadcasting sched@@ ule .
what the s broadcasting director wants is not bank books .
here , take a shot .
- che@@ ers - thanks for your hard work .
i heard that they 're swit@@ ching the writ@@ er for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
that lee go e@@ un , who wrote the syno@@ p@@ sis , came to the director and made a scene , i heard .
but it 's a new genre we 've not done before .
how much better could an experienced writ@@ er be ?
in the end , it is up to the production skil@@ ls of represent@@ ative kim of the world production .
and we all know that rec@@ ently , many production compan@@ ies start shooting , then run out of money , and end up not pay@@ ing the ac@@ tors and the film@@ ing crew .
we 've seen so many cas@@ es like that .
if you 're giving the s@@ lot to represent@@ ative kim , it would be good to make sure about the fun@@ ding situation .
i know , i already told anthony about secur@@ ing the fun@@ ds .
you have a visit@@ or .
good evening .
hey , represent@@ ative kim !
what br@@ ings you here ?
i came here to get dinner , and i heard that you were here , so i 've come to say hi .
oh , i see . come in , come in .
yes .
i was thinking about what you said earlier today , director .
and i admit that i was in the wrong .
as you had re@@ quest@@ ed , i will bring you a bank book showing the fun@@ ds and also draw up a budget plan .
of course , that you should .
here , have a drink .
huh ?
what are you doing outside ?
i have a favor to ask , director .
a favor ?
i heard that you play golf in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong lat@@ ely ... give me the combin@@ ation of your lo@@ cker , and i 'll prepare something for you by tomorrow .
represent@@ ative kim ...
it 's just a to@@ ken of my appreci@@ ation .
please take it .
appreci@@ ation for what ?
the certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot .
hey , anthony , are you still doing this crap ?
what about you , director ?
what ? last year , on march 24 and september 13 , k@@ j production sent you some to@@ ken appreci@@ ations .
watch your words .
i thought they were just rum@@ ors .
that 's right . totally sen@@ sel@@ ess rum@@ ors .
got it ?
yes , i 'm sure .
alright .
oh , would you check if my car is parked ok outside ?
it 's black , and the number is 89@@ 11 .
yes , i shall , director .
are you still doing things this way ?
what ... do you mean ?
i guess people never change .
since i had a drink , i 'll just say one thing as a man .
represent@@ ative kim , i ... hate you . ( dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s )
i especially hate those dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness of how you do your business .
yes , those dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness are exactly how i 've been doing my business , and i 'll continue to do so .
now , think about it .
how much longer do you think you 'll be in the drama department , chief produc@@ er nam ?
the way i see it , with all the promo@@ tions , 5 years at best ?
do you even have a plan for your reti@@ rement ?
that 's why you 're such a low jer@@ k , bastard .
thank you .
i 'm pay@@ ing for my own drin@@ ks .

oh , that ?
i 've found a few after some intern@@ al investig@@ ation .

so that he 'll never come near this field ...

get the money and deli@@ ver it right away .
i 'll go get the certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot .
yes , i got it .
where did they all go with the door open ?
writ@@ er lee ...
i just came to get my stuff ...
what is that ? yes ? oh , it 's nothing .
well , you know , miss writ@@ er , it is in@@ evit@@ able for the production to start , so ... it just happens this way .
i guess " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be the inaugur@@ al work of world production .
yes .
break a leg .
thank you .
and the writ@@ er ?
still in search for a dec@@ ent experienced one .
good .
alright , you may leave .
well , have a good day . one of my assist@@ ants just stopped by the oh@@ hy@@ ung golf course in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong , and says that it looks really nice , perhaps they 've renov@@ ated the interior .
you should go check it out .
so , has the fun@@ ding issue been resol@@ ved ?
yes , he got the money from a japan@@ ese spon@@ sor .
there 's nothing to worry .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
wow , represent@@ ative kim has done it in the end !
how impres@@ sive .
right ?
in that dirty way .
it 's all thanks to your concer@@ ns .
do you know how many har@@ d-@@ working profession@@ als in this field fall in desp@@ air because of people like you ?
yes , i 'm well aware of them .
i 'm one of those profession@@ als in this field as well .
excuse me .
yes , director .
hey , you bastard .
is this a joke ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
how dare you make a fool of me ?
that 's not possible .
why would the money be missing ?
hello , hello !
dire@@ c ..@@ .... produc@@ er jo@@ o , what happened ?
did you make the deli@@ very ?
well , that@@ is ...
represent@@ ative ...
hurry up and tell me !
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un has hid the money bag , so i couldn 't even leave the office .
what ?
represent@@ ative .
where did you put it ? you were acting as though everything will go smooth@@ ly if i wasn 't on the team , but in reality , you had to use such dirty means !
it doesn 't matter .
why doesn 't it matter ?
i didn 't leave just so you could do this !
you left on your own . just give it up .
where is that money ? the money is for produc@@ ing the drama , not for lo@@ bb@@ ying with bri@@ bes like that .
you don 't know anything , stay out of it .
then explain it then .
there 's no time for that .
just tell me , where is that money ?
i won 't say a word until you convince me completely .
without that money , this drama won 't happen .
are you happy now ? your writing will not be broad@@ cast . if you have to cover everything up with money to produce it ,
i don 't need it .
i 'm the original writ@@ er ,
forget about it then .
produc@@ er jo@@ o .
yes .
when , and how did she hide it ? while i was away for a sec , at least she didn 't leave this place . um@@ m , represent@@ ative , the golf putting range clo@@ ses in 30 minutes .
miss writ@@ er , represent@@ ative isn 't doing this because he wants to .
don 't just stand there like that , and say something !
won 't you ?
move .
why should i move ?
i said move !
aren 't you getting out of the way ? you keep ignoring me , you 'd better get a law@@ yer . even if you get the production going with bri@@ bes ,
i will make sure that it doesn 't get ai@@ red !
sue all you want .
you 'll be watching my drama as you wait for the proce@@ eding .
open it !
open it !
hey !
man , i keep missing the ball ! it 's not just the balls i 'm missing . my arms and legs feel like they 're not mine .
yes , it 's me , director .
there was a slight accident on our part , but i 'm just calling you now to tell you that i deli@@ vered it myself .
yes , sorry .
yes .
you 've still got something to say ?
you !
you know what ?
what ?
what an e@@ e@@ evil ( sl@@ ur@@ red spe@@ ech as she 's drunk ) nast@@ y , dirty , jer@@ k you are ?
do you know what a col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , cruel , in@@ fern@@ al s@@ cum you are ?
you called me to ask me that ?
sure , i 'll give you my answer .
i am aware of it . more than any@@ body in the world . living like that , are you happy ?
living stup@@ id@@ ly like you , how is that ?
what about you living so stup@@ id@@ ly , being tr@@ amp@@ led and tor@@ n apart ?
i am not un@@ happy .
because , despite the world being dirty like you , i am living .
your kind doesn 't understand the world .
the world has been very dirty from the beginning . by fair means or fou@@ l , emer@@ ging victor@@ ious through force , and domin@@ ating the lo@@ ser@@ s is the world .
i am going to trium@@ ph in this fil@@ thy world .
you are going to fall .
there 's something else you don 't know .
in my mind now , to be living here is hell .
hy@@ ung , you 're not coming back tonight ?
probably not .
hy@@ ung , it 's a guest .
guest ?
ap@@ ologies for coming so late at night .
i don 't know if you 've heard but i won 't be able to keep my promise .
i 'm really than@@ k@@ ful that you liked my work , but for un@@ avo@@ id@@ able circum@@ stances , i had to quit .
what ?
so are they changing the writ@@ er ?
you got fired then .
yes .
i got fired . i got fired because i don 't have any experience .
at any rate , although i won 't be working on it any more , the script still means a lot to me .
please , treat that script like a child that has lost its mother until the very end and ful@@ fill your role with affec@@ tion .
so ?
did you come to me to get you un@@ fired ?
no , i didn 't come for that at all .
i just ...
but , what do you mean by " no ? " you tried everywhere else , it didn 't work , so you 've come here , preten@@ ding to be nice , asking me to help you , right ? asking me to help you , right ?
no , i 'm not like that .
it 's no use .
come to think of it , i was a bit nervous about the writ@@ er being a ro@@ o@@ kie .
this is for the best .
don 't get your heart broken over this . it 's the nature of this field .
that 's not it !
what the he@@ ck ?
i put my everything at st@@ ake for my " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
though i 'm leaving , i want you all to take it seriously with affec@@ tion .
is that so hard , you idi@@ ots ?
! is she crazy ?
what are you doing ?
drag her out of here .
yes . leave .
you mor@@ ons !
- you 're so drunk .
- it 's mine !
- what 's yours ?
- just go !
- let go of me !
you can 't just get drunk and bar@@ ge in like that . living like that , does it make you happy ?
scre@@ en@@ writ@@ er : lee go e@@ un
hey , un@@ ni !
hey , watch your driving !
that was close .
wow , you 're pretty .
- no@@ on@@ im , how old are you ?
- how old are you ?
- un@@ ni , you see , we 're hungry ...
- ai@@ ii@@ ii@@ ish .... hey , get out all you 've got . hey , get out all you 've got .
stop staring like that and give us your money !
ah well , can 't be helped .
good evening , police officer . good evening , police officer .
i 'm on the back@@ street by hy@@ und@@ ai villa in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ -@@ dong .
three drunk high@@ scho@@ ol@@ ers are trying to do something to another drunk woman .
oh , i 'm just a ci@@ vili@@ an cit@@ izen .
one that pays a lot of tax@@ es .
please dis@@ pat@@ ch someone here quick . thanks !
well ...
i 'm ... really in a bad mood tonight ...
so .. could you guys just ... leave me alone ?
wow , did i just hear that right ?
hey , do you want to die ?
you 'd better let go of me .
honestly ...
what is she ?
you high@@ school br@@ ats !
aren 't you supposed to be stud@@ ying ?
dang , i should have avo@@ i@@ ded her eyes .
at any rate , is she really a writ@@ er ?
she 's like a gang@@ ster !
how scar@@ y .
jesus christ !
yes ?
well , do you know lee go e@@ un ?
so if i do ?
this is gang@@ nam police department . i understand that she was drunk , but what kind of a lady be@@ ats up three kids like that by herself ?
she passed out once she got here , and we didn 't know who to contact .
we checked her recent call history , and saw that she had made several calls to you .
at any rate , what is your relationship to her ?
she put you down as " yo@@ un@@ de@@ ung@@ po crazy dog " on her contac@@ ts list .
so i got curious .
three million won ( ~ $ 3@@ k usd ) for a sett@@ lement isn 't too bad .
is it ok if she sp@@ ends the night here ?
huh ?
um@@ m ..
hey hey ! today , on the olympic expres@@ s@@ way in seoul , a drunk truck driver cras@@ hed his truck and killed one person .
at the time of the accident , the blood alcohol content of truck driver kim had ex@@ ce@@ eded the level of 0.1 % , which means his license will be suspen@@ ded .
the police are still investig@@ ating the exact circum@@ stances of the accident , and plan to charge truck driver kim with du@@ i .
on another note , early this morning , the director of the drama department of a certain broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
it has been announced that moon is suspected of charges of accep@@ ting bri@@ bes relat@@ ed to privil@@ eg@@ es associ@@ ated with drama broadcasting slo@@ ts .
the police announced that they will investig@@ ate the matters further and will se@@ ek str@@ ict correc@@ tive me@@ as@@ ures .
addit@@ ional investig@@ ations are still going on .
this news was brought to you by mb@@ s , kim so ye@@ on .
does seeing someone get arrest@@ ed give you back some senses ?
huh ?
you should thank the person who paid your sett@@ lement money . you may go .
sett@@ lement money ?
who ? that " young@@ de@@ ung@@ po crazy dog " took care of everything .
... drama department of a certain broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
... announced that he is suspected of accep@@ ting bri@@ bes privil@@ eg@@ es associ@@ ated with broadcasting slo@@ ts ....
thanks for the good news , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
it 's rather surpris@@ ing that the cul@@ prit behind all this is not on the list .
we just got the search war@@ rant , so we 're going through all his office , house , and car .
one of those places should have it .
there 's one more place to check .
one more place ?
a personal lo@@ cker at oh@@ hy@@ ung golf course in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong .
personal lo@@ cker ?
it is a prefer@@ red venue for one of the bri@@ be don@@ ors .
yes .
keep up with your good work .
you 've caused director moon to fall in order to get to anthony ? director moon will probably conf@@ ess everything anyway , but once the money bag is found , that 's the moment of doom for anthony .
then , that broadcasting s@@ lot goes back to nul@@ l .
sched@@ ule a meeting for tomorrow morning .
yes . yes .
i like the news today .
yes .
i understand .
the search war@@ rant is out .
as soon as we get there , crack the door open and get the evidence right away .
ah , ais@@ h .
get the to@@ ols !
this way !
there 's a guy that 's just leaving the building .
get him ! yes , i understand .
this morning , the director of the drama department of a broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed .
moon is suspected of charges of receiv@@ ing bri@@ bes for privil@@ eg@@ es regar@@ ding broadcasting slo@@ ts .
isn 't he from the broadcasting station for your drama ?
is your drama going to be ok when someone big like him gets arrest@@ ed ?
i think it 'll be ... ok .
seriously .
he should have just e@@ aten gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els instead of stu@@ ff@@ ing his gut@@ s with other people 's money .
it 's me , produc@@ er jo@@ o . i just saw the news , is that money ok ?
oh , it was close .
fortunately , represent@@ ative saw the news and took immedi@@ ate action , so it 's all safe .
it was really close . we were so lucky .
then , there 's no problem with the drama ?
well , i 'm not sure , for the moment ...
hello .
miss writ@@ er , i 'm sorry , but i have to go to a meeting now .
if anything changes or gets decided , i 'll contact you .
now that the director has been arrest@@ ed , empire will try to shake up the broadcasting sched@@ ule .
how are things at empire ?
they sub@@ mit@@ ted the syno@@ p@@ sis of " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of writ@@ er je@@ ong yesterday through assistant director kim .
i heard that the syno@@ p@@ sis is 10 pages long .
you can get a s@@ lot even without a syno@@ p@@ sis , and this is " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 . "
what is writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o doing ?
working on the script for the first two episodes .
no@@ tif@@ y me as soon as the first dr@@ af@@ ts are done .
who are the potential candidat@@ es for the next director of s broadcasting ? based on the accompl@@ ish@@ ments from last year and the first half of this year , assistant director park is most likely .
have you e@@ aten yet ?
he started out as an open re@@ cru@@ it , and has the reputation of being a nice person with good skil@@ ls among the produ@@ cer@@ s , so many direc@@ tors support him .
however , based on school ties , some predic@@ t that assistant director kim , who went to the same school as the president of s broadcasting , will be the one .
also , assistant director kim 's wife is known for her influence .
she even moved their family residence so that their children would go to the same school as the president 's .
that says a lot .
assistant director kim ....
it was empire 's oh jin wan that caused the fall of director moon .
what ?
yesterday , the syno@@ p@@ sis of writ@@ er je@@ ong was given to a.@@ d. kim , and director moon was arrest@@ ed this morning .
to plan an ar@@ rest without a war@@ rant the very day of today ... means that they predic@@ ted that we 'd bri@@ be director moon .
you mean , the person who repor@@ ted director moon to the author@@ ities is ...
he wanted to get me arrest@@ ed .
the decision of cho@@ os@@ ing a new director is up to the president .
the most likely candi@@ date is a.@@ d. kim .
no@@ tif@@ y me as soon as s broadcasting makes the announ@@ cement of the personnel changes tomorrow .
yes .
you all go home .
yes .
the personnel changes have been announced .
[ announ@@ c@@ ements from the human re@@ sources department ]
- what is this ?
- what does this mean ?
the director is coming !
good morning .
well done .
let me count on your assistance .
i expect much gu@@ id@@ ance from you all .
let 's take our se@@ ats .
we would like to turn this un@@ fortun@@ ate event around and use it as a trig@@ ger to introdu@@ ce a revolution@@ ary change in the drama department of s broadcasting .
and i believe that the prior@@ ity is to en@@ sure that we produce high qu@@ ality dram@@ as , work with ac@@ tors loved by the public , and keep the production environ@@ ment clean and transpar@@ ent .
consequ@@ ently , the broadcasting sched@@ ule for november determined by the previ@@ ous director is going to be totally re@@ vamp@@ ed .
that is all .
i don 't accept con@@ grat@@ ul@@ atory messages .
i know how you hate me the most . i 've been doing business using the dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness that you hate so much , and i know how you think of me as a mor@@ ally devo@@ id person .
however , director , please give me this one chance .
i beg of you .
just one chance ?
however , that one chance might allow someone like you to control this whole field of dram@@ as .
i 've decided against it .
i won 't change my mind .
please leave .
- what 's going to happen to our s@@ lot ?
hurry ! that position should have been yours , assistant director .
show him who 's really in power in this department .
you 're not my superior !
i will get my work publ@@ ished and pro@@ udly present my name , lee go e@@ un on the script .
we 'll re@@ inst@@ ate writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
no one would write " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " better than her .
it 's not over yet !
why don 't you just can@@ cel your contr@@ act ?
- i 'll help you with that .
- this is all for our drama .
you mean , your drama . the weapon with which anthony , king of dram@@ as , will take back his real@@ m .
i 'll wait for you .
just don 't take too long to return .
episode 6 the division in front of enem@@ ies this is your writing contr@@ act . well , then ... sign here .
leave now . move ! - get out of my way !
- what are you guys doing ? let go . i said to move !
no , lee go e@@ un !
-@@ what is this ? !
drag him out of here !
you can 't sign !
fine , i 'll give you what you want .
i will leave its genre the same as the current one , noir .
and without the present day 's scene , i will keep the first episode same as your draft !
writ@@ er , it 's a lie .
just go ahead and sign .
what 's this ?
drag him out of here !
wait just a minute !
go on .
i 'll take out the supervis@@ or too .
writ@@ er lee , it isn 't once or twice that he 's fool@@ ed you !
because he 's desperate , he 's lying to get what he wants .
no , that 's not the case . you know how anthony works , it 's all the same as three years ago !
no , lee go e@@ un ! you 'd better be prepared for the law suit , because i 'll never lose it to you .
don 't trouble yourself about it .
you made a good decision .
yes .
we should go eat .
there is a really great japan@@ ese restaurant nearby .
next time . today i have another engagement .
ah , yes . if you were thinking of sig@@ ning from the start , what was your reason for calling me ?
do you know what you just did ?
you just tore my drama , no , my life to pieces .
didn 't know i was such an important person .
what ?
! why not ?
you get to do whatever you want to do but i can 't do what i want to do ?
that 's why i said we 'd do without the melo@@ drama as a noir , without a supervis@@ or , whatever you wanted !
exactly , so ful@@ fill all those prom@@ ises as you said .
what does that mean ?
director , you are amazing .
in the end , you really defe@@ ated anthony .
what did i say .
the one who laugh@@ s in the end is the win@@ ner .
director , what 's the matter ?
what ?
what did you just say ?
i didn 't sign .
lee go e@@ un !
next time ... so the reason you came here , was to get what you want under the pre@@ text of sig@@ ning ?
yes , so make sure you definitely keep your prom@@ ises .
since i have it recor@@ ded here .
ge@@ ez , where did you learn to do that ?
who do you think ? from you , represent@@ ative .
what ?
why are you so surprised ?
like an amateur ...
i heard this is what they usually do in the field .
do you have confidence you can do it ?
i 'm asking if you can take respon@@ sibil@@ ity for your decision .
what are you trying to say ? if in november we were to completely fa@@ il , the sun will shine as if nothing 's happened .
but you and i will be finished . i know , that it 's not just you and i , but all the people involved in this work .
we will either succe@@ ed or fa@@ il sol@@ ely on my decision .
that 's why i can 't give up .
we will win .
are you sure you can win ?
i mean , if you 're sure what 's the chance ( % ) of win@@ ning ?
you 've always told me , " believe in me . "
this time , represent@@ ative , it 's your turn to believe in me .
what is this ?
this is the key for that writing space you wanted .
my own writing place ?
so this is something you prepared ?
you thought i 'd make you write in that tiny place forever ?
we must win this war .
that ras@@ cal .
here .
over this way .
over this way .
did anyone see a cut@@ ter kn@@ ifer here ?
what ?
on that brick pil@@ lar , you shouldn 't paint with white !
not that one , but over there , please paint there .
everyone , enjoy your meal .
did you know ?
that the represent@@ ative picked this place ?
yes .
you already knew ?
yes .
- so only i didn 't know ?
! i found the place .
really ?
de@@ pos@@ it is 5 million won ( $ 5,000 ) and mon@@ th@@ ly rent fee is 300,000 won ( $ 300 ) . de@@ pos@@ it is 5 million won ( $ 5,000 ) and mon@@ th@@ ly rent fee is 300,000 won ( $ 300 ) .
where should we put this ?
just put it anywhere over here .
che@@ ers .
-@@ che@@ ers !
finally , writ@@ er lee gets her own writing space !
it was with everyone 's help .
to be honest , i never imagined director would ever get you your own place ! though director seems like a vic@@ ious man from the outside , he 's not like that on the inside .
but hy@@ ung , what kind of director will come ?
who knows ?
that ... is not going to be easy .
why ?
i think director kim hy@@ un min would be good for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
we 've done other works together , too .
you see , director kim is , uh .... difficult to get , it seems he 's already working on another piece .
then what about director je@@ ong ?
ah director je@@ ong !
.. will also be difficult .
difficult ?
uh , that 's because ...
why ?
do you possibly have another director in mind ?
no , it 's not like that !
just wait a little longer , we 're doing our best to convince ...
convince ?
there was a meeting of the regular p@@ ds that caused a problem with as@@ sig@@ ning a director for the drama .
i will never work with that jer@@ k , anthony .
when he was kicked out of this field , everybody ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ded in celebr@@ ation !
i still get upset whenever i think about the way he hum@@ ili@@ ated me ! and now , you expect me to work with him ?
yes , i understand your point . but what 's important is that this " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is not just anthony kim 's drama , but a drama of our s broadcasting . do you understand ?
you 're the one who 'd been insist@@ ing , director , that the broadcasting stations should not work with s@@ cum like him !
it 's not like he 's the represent@@ ative of empire , he 's just a represent@@ ative of a ro@@ o@@ kie thir@@ d-@@ rate ...
third rate ? !
director kim , your " paradise lost " had hit the rat@@ ing of 35.@@ 9 % .
also , director je@@ ong and director yo@@ on , you all had big hits after working with me and became represent@@ ative direc@@ tors of s broadcasting .
how can you , after ach@@ ie@@ ving your current fame thanks to me , call me a thir@@ d-@@ rate produc@@ er ?
! you call that fame ?
it was hum@@ ili@@ ation !
you were rul@@ ing the shooting sites as if you were the director .
i won 't take that again .
i took action only because you weren 't a good leader !
what ?
are you talking down to me ?
what do you think you are doing ?
this is a statement of the position of the regular p@@ ds . we 'd like to make it clear to you that every one of us , p@@ ds of s broadcasting ,
statement of refus@@ al to work refus@@ es to direct anthony 's production , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
let 's get out of here . you normally per@@ s@@ ist with your own decisions , why are you back@@ ing down this time ?
are you trying to get back at me ?
get back at you ?
get back at me for having my way with the s@@ lot .
represent@@ ative kim ...
do you judge all the people of the world by your own standards alone ?
just answer my question . i 'm the director of the drama department . reg@@ ard@@ less of whether i like the s@@ lot decision or not , once it has been decided ,
i have also put my life on the line for this drama .
happy now ?
oh , yeah ... and also ...
does it ever occu@@ r to you that your twisted ways of doing business cost you the trust of our pd 's ?
i trust vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings more than people .
also , i 'm one of .. no , more than anyone , have put my life on the line for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
if we can 't find one intern@@ ally , then ...
i 'll bring a se@@ as@@ oned vet@@ eran director from outside .
a se@@ as@@ oned vet@@ eran ?
like who ?
i think the situation will be the same outside , too .
this morning i saw this coming and i thought of someone .
director go@@ o ?
yeah .
if the intern@@ al direc@@ tors refuse to work with us , why not work with fre@@ el@@ an@@ cer@@ s like director go@@ o ?
he hasn 't done anything in a while , but he is a tried and true vet@@ eran .
he was the best at one point , with four dram@@ as that had over 30 % in vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing ...
but ... he 's a gon@@ er now .
gon@@ er ?
five years ago , when he left the field , he reti@@ red completely and lives out in the coun@@ try@@ side .
reti@@ red ?
why ?
i don 't know the speci@@ fic@@ s , but ... there are rum@@ ors that sug@@ gest that he 's become an alco@@ hol@@ ic .
well ...
i 've also heard that he 's become a dog s@@ eller in some remo@@ te place .
a dog s@@ eller ?
no way .
director go@@ o young mo@@ k is a serious alco@@ hol@@ ic who can 't even function as a person .
no way he can direct again .
no , that 's something you have to cre@@ ate .
also , wasn 't it you who had produc@@ ed the last drama of director go@@ o ?
you should know very well what a great director he is , then .
listen to me .
given our current situation , the best person for the job of direc@@ ting " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is director go@@ o young mo@@ k .
no one else will do . we 've asked other exter@@ nal direc@@ tors whose sched@@ ules are compat@@ ible , but they all said no .
it takes a dog to recognize a dog .
director ...
long time , no see ' che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong 's crazy dog . '
i don 't live in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong any more .
a dog is a dog no matter where he lives .
come inside .
what br@@ ings you all the way here ?
can 't just be to have a drink with me .
i want you to come with me to seoul .
seoul ?
that 's a real dog mess there .
what are you sch@@ em@@ ing ?
i want you to direct a drama .
drama ?
why ?
is there no one willing to direct for you ?
after not seeing you for a@@ while , you 're still making me laugh .
stop wast@@ ing your effort and go back .
i was done direc@@ ting dram@@ as 5 years ago .
that 's when my life ended , too .
first day of broadcasting is november 5@@ th , 20 episodes , period piece .
my contact information is inclu@@ ded , so give me a call after you read it .
crazy bas@@ t * * * .
you 're ru@@ in@@ ing my drink , get lost !
you 've been drinking for 5 years , haven 't you had enough ?
you 're the one that had said , the place for me to breathe and to stop breathing is the shooting site .
there 's not much time .
you have to give me a decision within 3 days .
get out !
before i stick the dogs on you !
represent@@ ative oh .
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
explain it to me .
i don 't know what you mean ... the japan@@ ese invest@@ or , the broadcasting s@@ lot !
how much longer are you going to let anthony have his way like that ?
i 'm sorry .
a ho@@ und that had been lo@@ yal to its master bit@@ es the master .
that guy ... what should we do about him ?
we must catch him .
no ...
catch him and kill him .
before he fin@@ ishes shar@@ pen@@ ing his fang@@ s in preparation of reven@@ ge .
if left alone , he 's going to attack me with those fang@@ s .
i understand .
you 'd better make sure that you do it right this time .
there are so many ho@@ unds out there to re@@ place you .
let 's go .
it 's been a@@ while .
yes . yes .
once more ... i 'll need your help .
when do you have time ?
hello everyone !
our guest today is south korea 's most popular , handsome guy , the prince in the drama industry . the top star , everyone who is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
korea 's best top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , come on out !
wow , seriously , your popular@@ ity is as high as the sky , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
oh , thank you .
everybody , as you see k@@ ang hy@@ un min in person , how do you feel ?
he 's so hot !
- he 's so handsome !
they say you are very good looking .
thank you .
when i see you here , seriously , the word " sculp@@ tu@@ re-@@ like handsome guy " used to describe you isn 't ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
oh , you over@@ pr@@ ais@@ ed me .
thank you .
wow , you 're even hum@@ ble .
indeed , you 're the top actor .
yes , yes , yes .
how do you feel about all these people coming out to see you ?
oh , well , of course , i 'm very than@@ k@@ ful .
is that so ?
yes , i 'm so grateful .
people who love k@@ ang hy@@ un min , scream !
thank you so much .
thank you , thank you .
yes , yes .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min s@@ si , i don 't think we can do an interview here !
i agree .
let 's go inside and do the interview .
shall we ?
because , in this crowd ... i just don 't think it 's possible .
i understand .
okay , everyone !
we 'll be going in now .
see you guys later !
look outside .
all your loving fans are still outside .
your popular@@ ity is incredi@@ ble !
thank you .
so , i heard you 're shooting a new drama .
yes .
the drama 's called , ' morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' and i am playing the role as ' kim wo@@ o jin . '
'@@ morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ?
' wow , the title 's very impres@@ sive .
so , is there a reason why you chose this drama over others ?
well , let 's see ...
reading the script made my whole body shud@@ der .
it gave you the shud@@ ders ?
i thought this was one drama i should never pass on .
i see ... reading the script gave you the chil@@ ls .
i 'm really looking forward to seeing this drama .
but , on another note ...
yes ?
there 's a ru@@ mor that you 're being paid the most among all ac@@ tors in the country .
that 's right isn 't it ?
that ... is not true . when i sel@@ ect a drama
i do not ever take into account how much i get paid .
i leave all that to my manager so , in truth , i have no idea how much i make .
a drama is a work of art .
i believe that exces@@ sive thought of money ... can be fat@@ al to an actor .
wow , ' exces@@ sive thought of money can be fat@@ al to an actor ?
' you are truly a great actor ....
what 's wrong ?
no matter how much i think about it , i 'm still angry .
does it even make sense that a drama is not made mel@@ o ?
this drama seems better that it 's not mel@@ o .
darling , do you think i like mel@@ o dram@@ as ?
mel@@ o is money ... money !
it has to be mel@@ o so people love the drama , and that 's exactly how i get cf off@@ ers !
ah , that 's right , the director can change that .
the director can change it towards a more mel@@ o drama .
what ?
who 's our film director , kw@@ ang so@@ o ?
who knows ?
has it not been decided yet ?
call anthony and find out .
right now .
who is it ?
who are you dating ?
it 's ...

you rot@@ ton excuse of a human being .
yes , i 'm listening .
where are you right now ? i 'll be there as soon as the sun 's up tomorrow , so you all better be prepared !

a@@ igo . director !
welcome back , director !
it 's been a very long time !
so you 're the broadcasting director dog now ?
ah , yes .
you 're still the same , director go@@ o .
speaking of which , you 're still here ?
ah , director ... please show me your enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m , just like you did when i first entered the company .
please take good care of the show .
ask that to the rat@@ ing .
both you and i will die or live depen@@ ding on that number .
it 's this way .
this is the place .
writ@@ er lee ?
nice to see you !
hello , director !
hello !
director of photo@@ graphy !
wow , how long has it been !
?
this is the ligh@@ ting manager .
wow ... how long has it been ?
this is the director of photo@@ graphy .
this set is impres@@ sive !
do you think ...
director go@@ o won 't have problems ?
there has to be problems .
par@@ don ?
we suppor@@ ted anthony to get his time s@@ lot and we now have some power ... now , we must take director nam down . wouldn 't it be easy to take director nam down , if his first drama , as the broadcasting director , fa@@ ils ?
how do you feel ?
i 'm so excited !
it makes my heart flut@@ ter that my own script will be made into a real drama !
keep that up with your script , too .
yes , director .
we should have dinner together with the team .
i 'll make a reserv@@ ation at a restaurant near the company .
i 'm already meeting someone tonight .
director go@@ o is a char@@ ming person .
yes , yes he is .
but don 't like him too much .
there 's no such thing as a conflic@@ t@@ less drama , but there 's no such thing as a conflic@@ t@@ less set either .
a@@ igo , director !
how do you do , director ?
i 'm k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i see , you 're hy@@ un min .
ras@@ cal , you are indeed handsome .
please make me look good on camera , too .
okay .
sit down , sit down .
i can 't tell you how glad we are that you are here , director .
i would especially like to talk to you about the genre of noir regar@@ ding this drama .
what are your thoughts on the genre ?
that 's what i like about it .
the fact that it is a fresh genre without the che@@ es@@ y melan@@ chol@@ y .
that 's why it really su@@ ited me .
that 's right .
you 're even good at selec@@ ting a good project ... i see why you 've become such a star , hy@@ un min .
yes . but even though i think that it 's okay , in general wouldn 't it be good to have a little bit of mel@@ o [ drama ] in it ?
don 't pay any attention to that anth@@ on@@ y-@@ like non@@ sense !
no , no , i don 't .
especially the ending scene of episode 1 ... is so full of the genre , it 's aw@@ esome !
exactly !
starting with the ending of episode 1 , we 're going to overwhel@@ m the screen ! hy@@ un min , your sharp eyes and your sculp@@ tured body will be cap@@ tured by 12 camer@@ as , action !
explo@@ de !
jump into the sea !
flames of fire everywhere . sp@@ las@@ hes of water can be heard as you sw@@ im across the tall waves .
close in on the sharp eyes of kim jin wo@@ o , and then ...
cut ! director , this is amazing !
the best scene ever in kore@@ an drama history !
what 's even more impres@@ sive is that we 're doing it for real without computer grap@@ hic@@ s .
g@@ wang so@@ o !
by the way , you do know how to sw@@ im , right ?
of course . i 've been training just in case .
do you know how to sw@@ im in the sea ?
excuse me ? the sea ? even though the weather is not ideal , it 's not winter yet , so the sea should be okay .
you can do it , right ?
eh ?
yes .
very good .
we should do this as we had origin@@ ally planned , - yes .
and if we need more , we can talk later as they come up .
- yes .
you go and show him .
what ?
you should look at this .
director go@@ o said to re@@ do the budget for episode 1 according to this ...
where is director go@@ o now ? five years is a long time , but " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has given me hope out of that desp@@ air . i , go@@ o young mo@@ k , will treat it as if it were my last drama , and leave my old , id@@ le ways of life and pa@@ the@@ tic attitude behind .
i will put my very best into this project ! there@@ fore , this project will be shot at a huge scale to match the qu@@ ality it de@@ serv@@ es , and we have a long , ar@@ du@@ ous journey ahead of us .
everybody , are you ready ?
!
yes !
though it 's not alcohol , let 's have a to@@ ast .
for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ! "
che@@ ers !
oh , represent@@ ative kim , good to see you .
have a seat . before that , let 's talk outside .
what ?
what do you want to say ?
what is this ?
what about this ?
you 're asking why ? twelve camer@@ as , a helicop@@ ter , 1,200 ex@@ tras , the cost@@ s for ac@@ tors , costum@@ es , and food for film@@ ing for 5 days , and even an explo@@ ding cru@@ ise !
you want to spend over a 1 bil@@ lion won ( ~ $ 1@@ million ) for just the last 5 minutes of episode 1 , are you for real ?
yeah , and so ?
what about it ?
there 's no way we can do that .
can 't do it ?
yes , can 't do it .
i want to pour every last drop of my passion into this , why can 't we do it ?
! why should i burn my money to fu@@ el your passion , director ?
this is the most important scene of this drama ! even so , over a bil@@ lion won for just 5 minutes is too much . i 'm prepar@@ ing a team that can work with a reason@@ able budget , so work something out with them .
and if i can 't do that ?
then i will be forced to use my last res@@ ort .
what 's that ?
you 're saying you will fire me ?
if you won 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
don 't play around .
you may be the one who brought me on board , but you can 't kick me off so easily .
that sounds fun .
oh it would be very fun .
really , what 's your personal problem ?
if people don 't do what you want , you thre@@ aten to fire them .
if you don 't know , but out since it 's not your concern .
represent@@ ative !
find another director .
i already told you .
there is no one else .
find one !
even if you have to search the whole country , or the whole world !
if there isn 't anyone , cre@@ ate someone !
yes , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
where ?
has it been 3 years ? enough with the formal@@ ities , you 're the represent@@ ative of the empire production .
but who is it this time ?
the one you want to te@@ ach a les@@ son ?
it 's someone you also know very well .
if it 's someone i know very well , who is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
actor k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
i 'm coun@@ ting on your help .
just like when you helped with bringing down anthony with the media re@@ ports 3 years ago .
just like bringing down anthony 3 years ago , huh ?
any@@ how , why is k@@ ang hy@@ un min your target ?
if i can 't cut off the head of the enemy , i shall cut off his hand that wiel@@ ds the sword .
me , go in the sea ?
even in the winter ?
does this make any sense ?
what kind of a director is he ?
he needs to learn to respect his ac@@ tors .
what if , while shooting the ending of episode 1 , something goes wrong like that ?
what about the rest of the drama ? i 'm ir@@ re@@ pl@@ ace@@ able for this whole business !
writ@@ er , are you listening to what i 'm saying ?
well , can 't you just go along and do it ?
no way ! they want to dun@@ k me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , the super@@ star , into the cold winter sea !
just do it ?
do you even know what the sea temperature is today ?
i even looked it up .
it 's 6@@ º@@ c ( 43@@ º@@ f ) !
six de@@ gre@@ es ! i can 't do this .
no , i choose not to !
you call yourself an actor , but the reason why you won 't do it is because it 's cold ?
yes , it 's because it 's cold !
i can toler@@ ate a lot of things , but not cold !
never !
su@@ ck it up !
i refuse to su@@ ck it up .
cut out that ending scene of episode 1 .
what 's that ?
or fix it so i won 't have to sw@@ im .
i 've got plenty of other min@@ d-@@ w@@ rec@@ king things right now , do you have to add to that , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
you promised .
that you would write for me .
how is that promise relat@@ ed to this issue ?
no matter what , i won 't go in the sea . either , talk director go@@ o out of it , or change the script .
i 'm leaving .
you 're impl@@ ying you 'll fire me ?
if you don 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
what is this ?
this is the budget list of episode 1 based on the w@@ ishes of director go@@ o .
and so ?
so ? !
it can 't be produc@@ ed this way !
i 'm going to change the director .
have you tried reason@@ ing ?
he 's very stub@@ born .
isn 't persu@@ as@@ ion one of the skil@@ ls of a produc@@ er ?
right ? if persu@@ as@@ ion doesn 't work , then you should incre@@ ase the budget .
so you 're a person without s@@ kill , produc@@ er kim .
in such a circum@@ stance , don 't we have to change the produc@@ er instead of changing the director ?
director !
represent@@ ative kim ...
right now all the direc@@ tors said that they can 't shoot a drama with you .
in such a case , what do you think will be our choice as a broadcasting station ? represent@@ ative kim , if you have no skil@@ ls , quit .
we will sign a contr@@ act with director go@@ o directly and make this drama on our own .
this person ...
writ@@ er lee ...
didn 't director go@@ o contact you perhaps ?
he didn 't .
and the represent@@ ative ?
well , that ... he went to the broadcasting station .
it seems like he 'll tell them that he 's going to fire director go@@ o .
writ@@ er lee ...
taxi !
you can come in .
you were looking for me ?
ah , yes .
yes , director nam .
about " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... " there is a possibil@@ ity that we will be produc@@ ing it our@@ selves , so please make prepar@@ ations for that .
but ...
in-@@ house production ?
yes .
yes ?
director , someone is here to see you .
okay .
oh , writ@@ er lee .
how ... is the scrip@@ t-@@ writing going well ?
yes .
as you may know , there is a bit of a problem between director go@@ o and represent@@ ative kim .
but you just need to focus on writing , writ@@ er lee .
i came because i heard that our represent@@ ative was here .
yes . you 'll have heard of it , our represent@@ ative and director go@@ o , neither of them are willing to give way .
it would be good if you could medi@@ ate between them .
please do us the fav@@ our . well , i gave a final notice to represent@@ ative kim and since you will find it out soon , i 'll tell you what 's going on .
if produc@@ er kim can 't clear up this situation , we have no choice but to produce " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " our@@ selves at s@@ bc .
in-@@ house production ?
yes , in-@@ house production .
so , that means world production will be exclu@@ ded from the production team .
do you really ... have to go this far ?
ah , nothing about your role will change , so please don 't worry too much .
i 'm sorry , but i think produc@@ ing the drama through world production is the right choice .
but , why are you on represent@@ ative kim 's side ?
are you trying to rep@@ ay him for rein@@ stat@@ ing you as the writ@@ er ?
huh ?
represent@@ ative kim rein@@ stat@@ ed me ... ?
what are you going to do now ?
i heard it from the director himself .
he said if it 's not director go@@ o they are going for in-@@ house production .
it 's not for you to inter@@ fere .
so are you going to pull out of the production ?
that 's not for you to worry about either .
i 'm asking because i 'm curious how you 're feeling .
you fired people whom you don 't like , but now you 're in the other side 's situation .
so i 'm wondering how you feel , probably it f * * * ing su@@ cks .
it feels dirty and pa@@ the@@ tic , right ?
that 's why people hate you .
don 't concern yourself .
that 's why there is no one left at your side .
i don 't need those bastar@@ ds .
but you said you wanted to make a succes@@ s@@ ful come@@ back .
to make that succes@@ s last long , you must not lose people . you don 't have any power now , not like when you were in empire .
what , are the things i said not correct ?
am i not correct ? that 's right . making this drama succes@@ s@@ ful and taking the re@@ ward from it for my come@@ back is the purpose of all of these .
and av@@ eng@@ ing on those people who took away my position and tr@@ amp@@ led on my power is the reason .
are they all like that ?
people born and raised in weal@@ thy hom@@ es and privil@@ ed@@ ged environ@@ ments ?
are they all like you ?
why can 't you just accept the reality of having fallen to the ground ?
is res@@ ent@@ ing the world your only option ?
so ? did i do anything wrong ? you , why on earth did you end up making dram@@ as ?
there 's no such non@@ sense as a reason .
you ... why on earth did you end up making dram@@ as ?
you jer@@ k , what did you say !
?
if you call me a fa@@ ther@@ less son of a b ... once more and you keep pr@@ att@@ ling on about my mother not being able to see , i 'll kill you !
what kind of kid is taught that ?
since you 're blind , i can 't tell you to look ( at my son 's face ) .
what are you going to do about my son 's face ?
!
i am sorry .
it 's my fault , because i 'm so l@@ acking .
why are you not apologi@@ z@@ ing ?
i didn 't do anything wrong .
what ?
i 'm spe@@ ech@@ less !
i 'm going to report you to the police !
the likes of this one should eat be@@ any rice .
e@@ un se@@ ok 's mother !
e@@ un se@@ ok 's mother ?
mother .
the exper@@ t already confir@@ med it .
this suicide doesn 't make sense ...
[ " the head of detec@@ tives " - a famous kore@@ an cop series in 1971 ~ 1989 . ]
the test res@@ ult came out .
stat@@ ure , age , blood type , they all did not match .
- what about the finger@@ prin@@ ts ?
- well ...
pay attention to the ... good job , you 're doing well .
did you find director go@@ o ?
yes , he 's in the bon@@ g@@ che@@ on@@ dong neighbor@@ hood .
i 'll send you his location .
if you don 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
give me a bottle of so@@ ju , please .
yes .
what business do you have here ?
are you going back to your cott@@ age ?
get lost .
you bastard , what the he@@ ck are you doing !
?
all in all , 1.@@ 05 bil@@ lion won .
this is the money you need to shoot the final scene of 5 minutes you want to shoot .
what game are you playing ?
!
those 5 minutes ... shoot them .
in exchange i 'll ask you one thing .
what is this drama to you ?
nothing will change . " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sang " is my last drama !
it 's not .
it 's the foundation for the next 10 years of your career .
i don 't care about your swe@@ et-@@ tal@@ ks about the future !
each episode is 60 minutes , so 1200 minutes in total . spen@@ ding 1 bil@@ lion on 5 minutes makes the remain@@ ing 119@@ 5 minutes a stret@@ ch .
no , this way your future 10 years dis@@ appear . for those moment@@ ary five minutes , please don 't throw away your glor@@ ious 10 years .
and five years ago don 't forget the day when you hit rock bottom .
hey you crazy bastard !
stop !
if i give up on those five minutes , what are you going to give me ?
the 5 lost years that you want to forget i will turn them into the joy of succes@@ s .
cle@@ an@@ ly , without a trace . hey punk ,
i told you to throw that blu@@ ff away first .
if it 's a blu@@ ff or not , you will see when the time comes .
director , about that director go@@ o and anthony ...
what about anthony ? director , about that director go@@ o and anthony ... what about anthony ?
well , looks like anthony has worked the kin@@ ks out with director go@@ o , so everything is in working order now ! in working order ?
yes !
sounded like anthony was able to persu@@ ade director go@@ o .
it seems like ... anthony has changed some@@ what .. he 's a different man now ...
what a strange world . alright , i see ... director go@@ o , huh ?
alright .
- see you .
what ?
really ?
yes , i decided to cur@@ b down my amb@@ itions . that is a great decision , director !
but what made you change your mind ? nothing special , it 's just 5 minutes , not worth throwing out 10 years ' worth of glory .
wow , i 'm so im@@ pressed !
im@@ pressed ?
whatever .
once you have enough experience , you 'll become more sensible , too , writ@@ er lee .
at any rate , i heard that hy@@ un min refus@@ es to do it ?
yes , he says sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea is too dangerous and difficult for him .
he asked me to change the script if we couldn 't change your mind .
okay .
so it 's too much for hy@@ un min , huh ?
what time is the ap@@ pointment with hy@@ un min ?
i 'll get to the point right away with director go@@ o , and you need to ch@@ ime in right then .
i got it .
you have to stand your ground . be firm .
got it ?
i said i understood .
let 's go , sparta .
get that thing ready , please .
yes , i see .
director , i heard that you like to drink .
so we prepared a special gift for you .
i stopped drinking .
excuse me ?
oh , we didn 't know .... well then , instead of wine ... nah , it 's ok .
as long as i don 't drink . here i 'll pour you a glass .
yes .
director .
about the ending scene of episode 1 , the way i see it , there is something that bo@@ thers me .
we 're thinking that the scale is rather un@@ re@@ alist@@ ic ...
what do you think ?
i agree .
i was a bit over@@ ly excited about that .
that 's right , director !
it was over@@ ly un@@ re@@ alist@@ ic , indeed !
no@@ wad@@ ays , the computer@@ graphic technology is so advanced , you can just do that .
you can just shoot it in an artific@@ ial pool , there 's no need to do it in real sea water .
that 's so old fashi@@ oned .
that 's not what i mean .
i meant that my amb@@ itions went over our budget .
what ?
then , how are we doing that scene ?
even if we turn down the scale , we should still film at sea .
um , director , what do you mean by that ?
no matter what , we 've got to shoot k@@ ang hy@@ un min sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea .
forget the clo@@ wn that just poses in front of the camera for good looks , we 're going to turn you into a serious actor with a ten@@ ac@@ ious passion .
how about it ?
don 't you want to stop being a clo@@ wn and start becoming a real actor ?
no .
i can@@ not accept that .
hy@@ un , hy@@ un min !
the wil@@ der the dog , once tam@@ ed , turns into something great .
give me just a moment , director .
hy@@ ung , how did it go ?
you don 't know ?
tell them they won 't see me until they get this thing sor@@ ted out !
huh ?
stop !
hey !
stop !
you can 't just storm out like this !
come back in , let 's talk to the director ... even if i die i 'm not going back in , so shut the door and get lost !
alright , then .
you 're not getting out ?
i can 't get out .
if you don 't get off , i won 't get out either even if i die .
they just took off .
yes .
i also saw with my own eyes that he had a drink .
okay .
i understand . you 've worked hard .
get started with our arrang@@ ements .
yes , i understand .
i heard that you and director go@@ o have reached an agreement .
yes .
that 's a relief .
were you sin@@ cere in saying it 's a relief ? i 'm just dying to know , how did you do it ?
do what ?
neither director go@@ o nor you , represent@@ ative kim , are known for comprom@@ ising their positions .
i made a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
i don 't think i 'm oblig@@ ed to di@@ vul@@ ge that information to you .
what ?
!
" a clo@@ wn that poses in front of the camera for a few good looking sho@@ ts " ?
" turn me into a real actor " ?
how dare he say that to me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
don 't you agree ?
!
why couldn 't he say that ?
what ?
!
don 't even think about going back and hiding in a pen@@ sion in yang@@ p@@ ye@@ ong to play video games .
turn the car around .
get out .
i know you don 't really have anywhere else to go .
why are you like this ?
!
you 're like a kid wh@@ in@@ ing to his mom whenever something goes wrong .
why wouldn 't i have anywhere to go ?
then where ?
where would you go ?
i 'll go see my mom !
what ? ou@@ ch !
man , everything is just driving me crazy !
a@@ igo , what do i do ?
!
ais@@ h , dar@@ n it !
shouldn 't we get out ?
oh , are you alright ?
i 'm really sorry .
why do something that 'll make you sorry ?
let the insur@@ ance company take care of it .
ah yes , we shall do that .
oh , by the way , aren 't you k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
never mind . just give me your contact in@@ fo .
of course .
man , what a has@@ s@@ le !
what is going on ?
just a fen@@ der-@@ ben@@ der . i re@@ ar-@@ ended his car .
oh , is that so ?
have you reached an agreement ?
yes , yes .
ah , but i think he has been drinking .
drinking ? sun@@ ba@@ e-@@ n@@ im , i 'm sure your project 's going well .
thanks to you .
i haven 't done anything .
it 's all thanks to your skil@@ ls .
what is it ?
bad news .
what bad news ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min just got caught for drunk driving .
his blood@@ -@@ alcohol content is enough to get his license suspen@@ ded .
where are you ?
ah , where is this ?
hello ?
hello , lee go e@@ un ?
say something , lee go e@@ un !
pre@@ view
tell me ! how did this happen ? if we let k@@ ang hy@@ un min res@@ ume his role , the public will critic@@ ize our whole broadcasting station .
shouldn 't you partner up with someone more trust@@ able ?
let 's re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min with a different actor .
i heard that writ@@ er lee go e@@ un isn 't doing so well , either , so both writ@@ er and actor should be re@@ placed .
i 'm just asking for some time !
car@@ zy dog , we need song bit na . absolutely .
i think everything was a set up , not a coinci@@ dence .
oh jin wan .
ah , you 're fir@@ ing me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
if we don 't get this worked out in three days , we 're do@@ omed !
ah , i don 't know , i don 't know i 'm going crazy !
the only person who can sol@@ ve this problem is your mother .
you know , my tum@@ my aches too much , doctor .
she doesn 't have any exter@@ nal in@@ jur@@ ies or any special symp@@ tom@@ s , why hasn 't she wo@@ ken up yet ?
the question is .. whether there is brain damage .
who are you ?
do ... i know that person , too ?
why do you not know me ?
you absolutely must remember me !
even if you have to use the power of hat@@ red , just remember me , lee go e@@ un !
episode 7 as@@ ph@@ alt g@@ ladi@@ ator out@@ patient reception ad@@ mission@@ d@@ isch@@ ar@@ ge proto@@ col@@ s come to your senses , lee go e@@ un !
tell me ! how did this happen ? !
while the cops caught me for drunk driving , she was on the phone , and then ... it all happened so quickly . go e@@ un ! - go e@@ un !
- wait , we have to get her to a scan@@ ner right away .
go e@@ un , why ?
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
how did this happen ?
why is my kid lying there un@@ conscious ?
answer me !
i 'm sorry . if by any chance , something happens to my child , i am really going to kill you !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
- there he is !
- he 's here !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
what is your take on the situation ?
please , even a sent@@ ence will do !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , would you please explain your drunk driving charge ?
is it true that you were fully drunk , and that your license is suspen@@ ded ?
what kind of effec@@ ts do you fore@@ see on your acting career ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min drinking and driving can he do the drama ?
how in the world can he drive while drunk right before his new drama is about to start ?
if we let k@@ ang hy@@ un min keep his role , the whole public might critic@@ ize our broadcasting station .
well , so ... what does the chief produc@@ er in charge think ?
since shooting hasn 't even started yet , i don 't think we need the risk of such a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al actor ...
so you want to cut him off ?
! yes , if you do something wrong , you should be pun@@ ished for it , but you don 't want to over@@ do the pun@@ ishment to the ex@@ tent of killing k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's life as an actor !
he 's done it to himself !
so , just because the media is critic@@ iz@@ ing him , you want to jump on the wagon and end his career , too ?
i can@@ not abandon my actor like that !
re@@ place the actor ?
let 's re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min with a different actor .
director !
it doesn 't make sense to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min when the public senti@@ ment is in such an u@@ pro@@ ar .
plus , it 's not just my personal opinion , but the whole drama department 's opinion .
i can 't do that .
is it because of the contr@@ act fee that you 've paid him in advan@@ ce ?
we can 't take the risk of his ru@@ ined reputation affec@@ ting our business just to ac@@ commo@@ date your financial situation .
i 've also heard that writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is not doing well , either .
i think it 's better to re@@ place both the writ@@ er and actor this time .
please , give me some time .
re@@ place them at once .
please , give me some time .
represent@@ ative kim !
just give me some time !
three days .
three days .
resol@@ ve all this in 3 days .
if you don 't resol@@ ve this in 3 days , no matter how much financial loss may in@@ cu@@ r , we re@@ place them both .
there 's no way that anthony would want to re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min and for@@ fe@@ it the 2 bil@@ lion won he paid him .
besides , there 's no other actor to re@@ place him with .
more@@ over , the writ@@ er is in a coma . in short , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is beyond re@@ pair at this point .
so , what is it you want ?
if " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is a no go , wouldn 't the empire 's " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " be a good su@@ b for it ?
i know very well that you had lent anthony a hand , assistant director .
forgive me for saying this , but why don 't you len@@ d that hand to someone more reli@@ able ?
someone who can really be a big help when you 're in need .
look at them all .
such vul@@ tures .
they don 't care about the person who got in@@ ju@@ red , but only about k@@ ang hy@@ un min if he 's coming or not .
how heart@@ less they are !
at any rate , i hope writ@@ er lee wak@@ es up from her coma .
what a dis@@ aster this is .
what is the problem ?
she doesn 't have any serious exter@@ nal in@@ jur@@ ies or odd symp@@ tom@@ s .
why isn 't she up yet ?
the question is whether there is any brain damage .
once we take a look at her brain scan@@ s , we 'll have more information , but at this point , it 's hard to say .
what are you so excited about ?
well , we 're really getting started with the project now !
i know very well that the fate of not just me and you , but everybody involved with this drama depen@@ ds on the cho@@ ices i make .
that 's why i can 't give up .
we 'll have victory for sure !
are you sure ?
what per@@ cent@@ age is your confidence rat@@ ing ?
you always said to me , " believe me . "
this time , it 's your turn to believe me , represent@@ ative .
i 'll stay here , so you guys can go back to work .
no , we 'll wait here , too , until she wak@@ es up .
yeah , even if i tried to work , i don 't think i 'll be able to focus on it .
are we going to collap@@ se here ?
are we going to collap@@ se , throwing a fit like a wh@@ in@@ y kid ?
lee go e@@ un will wake up .
absolutely .
get back to work so that we can start shooting with her script right away .
yes .
thank you .
what is it ?
what is it that you have to say ?
about the drunk driving incident of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ....
actually ...
-@@ represent@@ ative !
i found it .
the first news report of k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's drunk driving charge was written by reporter park se@@ ong bo@@ k of da@@ e@@ han daily .
what , park se@@ ong bo@@ k ?
yes .
the same reporter who had written that cal@@ um@@ ni@@ ous report about the death of the deli@@ very man 3 years ago .
it was also reporter park who re@@ ar-@@ ended k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's car .
i think it was all a sch@@ eme , not a coinci@@ dence .
oh jin wan !
where are you going ?
you can 't go in !
represent@@ ative ... please leave .
move out the way , unless you wish to die .
didn 't i war@@ n you that i was going to win this ...
are you crazy ?
you want to be su@@ ed ?
then do it .
oh jin wan , i 'm warning you !
you can do anything to me , but you can 't touch my actor , my writ@@ er , my people .
since when did anthony , to whom the end justif@@ ied any means , become an ad@@ voc@@ ate of justice ?
i learned it all from you .
in order to get what i want , i have to be col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded and mer@@ cil@@ ess , ext@@ ingu@@ ishing every last ray of hope !
then , here 's another les@@ son for you !
a death match is only between g@@ ladi@@ ators .
pd jo@@ o ?
represent@@ ative , i 'm calling to in@@ form you about lee go e@@ un .
deput@@ y director ... it 's me .
what i told you to do , i think you should hurry up and proce@@ ed with it .
immediately .
represent@@ ative !
what ?
the ct , did it come out okay ?
um , about that ... she woke up , but ... lee go e@@ un , are you okay ?
who are you ?
do i know him as well ?
you really don 't know me ?
i 'm not sure .
why don 't you know me ?
i am anthony .
anthony who buried you in this field 3 years ago after only using you , and later threw you away again without mercy ! it 's me , anthony !
do you even forget your hat@@ red and res@@ ent@@ ment towards me ?
this can 't be .
you must remember me .
even if you have to use the power of hat@@ red you must remember me , lee go e@@ un !
so you do know that .
how mean you have been to me !
always you were the one who tr@@ icked people , but now how do you feel being fool@@ ed ?
do you think i fell for such a cl@@ um@@ sy act of yours ?
i 'm sorry but i have been produc@@ ing dram@@ as for the last 10 years .
i have used the " am@@ n@@ esia " p@@ lot more than 100 times .
and also , you ... were the worst among all of the am@@ n@@ esia acting i 've seen .
so if you have time to make this kind of pet@@ ty joke , use that time to write scrip@@ ts !
pd jo@@ o already brought me my lap@@ top anyway !
hey , go e@@ un ! i brought your favorite , gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el ....
you 're here ?
pd jo@@ o , make sure writ@@ er lee gets everything she needs .
yes .
by the way , you totally fell for it earlier , didn 't you ?
i have never seen you being like that before , represent@@ ative .
so ... you mean " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of empire production ?
well ...
it 's not easy to find a top actor who is avail@@ able for shooting now . and more@@ over ,
empire production has finished its se@@ t-@@ up for shooting with the casting of kim jin wo@@ o .
kim jin wo@@ o ?
right now ?
that 's why it 's empire production , isn 't it ?
even if we wait one or two days more , it 's not like any great option will suddenly pop up .
director nam , let 's proce@@ ed ( with empire ) right away , no need to wait more ( for world ) . but as it was a promise i gave as director , let 's wait just for 3 days .
if there is no change after 3 days , i will re@@ consider the project . since writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is conscious now , i 'm very relieved then ..
i really dr@@ ank just one shot , but a license suspension ? those articles are all lies !
that breath@@ aly@@ zer was obviously manipul@@ ated !
it 's not the time to wh@@ ine that you 're w@@ ron@@ ged !
wh@@ ine ?
represent@@ ative ... if even you are tre@@ ating me like this ...
do you know why you were cast@@ ed ?
because you 're good at acting ?
because i like you person@@ ally ?
no , it was because the station would give me the broadcasting sched@@ ule if i brought you .
but because of your reck@@ less behavi@@ or , we 're now in a crisis and there is no other actor to immediately re@@ place you either .
if we don 't sol@@ ve this issue within three days , all of us are finished !
what do you mean " finished " ?
is it decided at the broadcasting station ?
me ?
you will fire me ?
me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
what ... should we do now ?
did you request the blood test ?
yes , but ...
i 'm not sure its res@@ ult from national for@@ en@@ sic service will come out within three days .
hy@@ ung ... it 's bit na , but she says your cell phone is turned off so ...
tell her i 'll call later .
then , what are you doing for media play ?
that 's , well ...
hy@@ ung ... it 's your mother ... oh my god , seriously !
mom !
how many times have i told you that i can 't come to you ? right now , there are tons of repor@@ ters waiting in front of my house , to bury your son , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , alive !
mom !
do you think your stom@@ ach@@ ache is a big deal now ?
aren 't you watching tv , mom ?
right at the moment when you had a stom@@ ach@@ ache and went to the er , i had a big accident , too !
i don 't know .
i 'm going crazy .
let 's talk later , bye !
watch your language to your mother !
she 's my mom , but she doesn 't even have a clue what happened to her son .
she 's nag@@ ging why i 'm not visit@@ ing her when she has a stom@@ ach@@ ache .
then , you should visit her !
huh ?
the only person who will resol@@ ve this situation is your mom .
well , from now on , our new script will begin .
hy@@ un min , you should lower your head as much as possible .
represent@@ ative choi and kw@@ ang so@@ o , you guys make a way for hy@@ un min , with the sin@@ cere mind to help him visit@@ ing his sick mother quickly .
hy@@ un min 's mother had a little bit of stom@@ ach@@ ache and went to er around at 6@@ pm yesterday .
she 's goes to the er so often just like she would visit her sp@@ a for a mas@@ sage .
so the doc@@ tors get so frustr@@ ated when they see my mom 's name .
yes .
she came again ? that 's because when they look at her , she looks too fine .
so , can you tell me which pain brought you here again ?
the stomach .
my stomach really hur@@ ts , doctor .
but last night , to run to your sick mother at er , you had no choice but to drive . but , yesterday , hy@@ un min 's mother left the er at 7 pm .
and the time of my accident was later than 8@@ pm .
that 's why we should make a story .
hy@@ un min got a phone call before that and ran to the hospital !
mom left the hospital with a doctor 's fac@@ ile pres@@ cription .
but then , bam !
there was an accident .
then , today ?
hy@@ un min 's mother 's symp@@ tom , which wasn 't serious yesterday , became serious today !
hy@@ un min ...
yes .
you and i , the fate of us is all depen@@ ds on your mother 's acting today .
where do you feel the pain ?
ma '@@ am , where is your pain , tell me !
bring doc@@ tors !
bring doc@@ tors !
it hur@@ ts , hur@@ ts , hur@@ ts !
for now , take ct scan@@ s !
yes .
ma '@@ am ?
oh , my tum@@ my !
aig@@ oo !
mom ! mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min had an accident on his way here yesterday , so he couldn 't come so@@ oner .
i heard that she compl@@ ained about serious stomach pain yesterday , too .
uh .... yes , yes , yes .
then , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i last night was because of an emergen@@ cy with his mother 's health ?
then , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i last night was because of an emergen@@ cy with his mother 's health ? why didn 't he explain that so@@ oner ?
listen , people , this is a hospital .
con@@ tain your@@ selves .
does the mother of k@@ r . k@@ ang hy@@ un min know , too ?
we 're waiting for the lab resul@@ ts cur@@ r@@ ently .
do you have any predic@@ tions about her diagno@@ sis ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min will have a press conference to answer all these questions .
please leave now .
this sm@@ ells f@@ ish@@ y ...
f@@ ish@@ y ?
when is k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's press conference ?
this coming friday .
no one must know about our plan .
there@@ fore , make sure that your mother , represent@@ ative choi , and g@@ wang so@@ o all zip it up .
yes .
we must keep this secret especially from lee go e@@ un , who 'll write your ap@@ ology to be read at the conference .
even from writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
but she 's one of us , though ?
she is one of us , but she can 't be one of us when we 're lying .
what do you think she 'd do if she found out about our dis@@ honest plan ?
i got it .
at times , the enemy within us can do the most damage .
never , never must she know !
the mother of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min is ill ?
last night , she couldn 't keep anything down even .
her stomach was in such a pain ... then , when you said that you were going to see your mother ... you were being serious ?
i know you don 't have anywhere else to go , why are you being like this ?
you 're like a kid wh@@ in@@ ing to his mom when something goes wrong !
why wouldn 't i have anywhere else to go ?
where ?
where are you going ?
i 'm going to see my mom !
happy ?
that 's right .
i 'm so sorry , i didn 't know ...
i understand .
i 'm sorry for not even contac@@ ting you when you woke up .
i had no idea that k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother was ill .
at least the media re@@ ports are sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic toward k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
what a relief .
great relief indeed , now that writ@@ er lee is also reco@@ vering sw@@ if@@ tly .
at any rate , that bastard represent@@ ative oh has reserv@@ ed a spot in hell .
att@@ acking k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's career with the du@@ i charge was all his doing .
man , the bad karma between our represent@@ ative kim and represent@@ ative oh ...
could it be that they were a married couple in their previ@@ ous life ?
why else would they be such enem@@ ies ?
why have you been ignoring my calls ?
is there someone beside you ?
no .
it 's okay now .
i 'd like you to find out one more thing .
see if the mother of k@@ ang hy@@ un min is really ill .
do you really have to go this far ?
what 's wrong with you ?
are you getting cold feet now ?
writ@@ er lee could have been seriously in@@ ju@@ red !
why do you think i planned this whole thing with k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i ?
my target is anthony .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i was just one of the means to get to that end .
lee go e@@ un is just an un@@ expected , un@@ fortun@@ ate casu@@ al@@ ty .
i don 't care who gets hurt and whose career gets ru@@ ined .
whatever you say , i can 't .... if something goes wrong , do you think you 'll be safe ?
if i expose that you were my m@@ ole , your career in this field will be totally over .
think of your fr@@ ail grandmother . unless you want to spend the rest of your life penn@@ il@@ ess and jo@@ bl@@ ess , and end up watching hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly as your grandmother passes away , and end up watching hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly as your grandmother passes away , do as i say .
do you really think anthony made it up ?
we shall find out soon enough . the moment the truth comes out that k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother was fak@@ ing her health problems , the du@@ i charge will be nothing compar@@ ed to that . it won 't be just k@@ ang hy@@ un min that falls , but anthony as well will be do@@ omed forever beyond hope in this field .
it 's not like i commit@@ ted a serious crime , why do i have to do this ?
reg@@ ard@@ less of the circum@@ stances , you did drink and drive .
you 've betr@@ ayed the trust of the public that have loved you , and you 've hurt their feelings .
this is not just for show .
unless you sin@@ cer@@ ely rep@@ ent , this whole thing is point@@ less !
did i ever ask them to love me ?
they just fell head over heels for me because i 'm so hot !
yes , you 're hot .
so you can also make a hot ap@@ ology .
unless you want to ru@@ in your career .
alright .
happy ?
happy about what ?
you need to practice .
practice until it hur@@ ts .
i am only what i am thanks to the love i rece@@ ive from the public , and i express my de@@ ep@@ est reg@@ re@@ ts for betr@@ aying the trust of so many fans ... wait , i think you should pause for a moment after " betr@@ aying the trust . "
i think you should lower your gaze slightly before moving on to the next words .
i am only what i am thanks to the love i rece@@ ive from the public , and i express my de@@ ep@@ est reg@@ re@@ ts for betr@@ aying the trust of so many fans .
good . next .
i do not want to try to justif@@ y my actions of that day with my personal circum@@ stances ...
that 's not it .
you have to show a surge of emotions .
think of your mom and pause .
... with my personal circum@@ stances .
nah , too weak .
go again !
i will accept all critic@@ is@@ ms for my actions and use them to drive myself to become a better person .
h@@ mm .
good .
par@@ don ?
you think it was stag@@ ed ?
well , i wouldn 't put it past anthony if he 's desperate enough .
listen , what if anthony just wanted to calm down the public senti@@ ment by stag@@ ing a health issue with k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother who is not sick at all ?
more@@ over , what if the truth came out ?
this would certainly harm the reputation of our station !
yes , i understand .
however , i don 't think we should make a hast@@ y decision about this . think about it , if , as you say , the truth were to come out , k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's career would be most affec@@ ted , right ?
would k@@ ang hy@@ un min really gamb@@ le his whole career like that ?
listen , director nam . the actor 's career depen@@ ds on the impression the public has of him .
there 's nothing he couldn 't do to re@@ store his ru@@ ined reputation .
alright , i see .
if , as you say , assistant director , the issue turns out to be stag@@ ed , then ... i will take away the broadcasting s@@ lot from " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
got it ? when ans@@ wering questions about your mother , don 't hesit@@ ate .
you 'll look more dej@@ ec@@ ted . still ,
i think we need to be clear about the issue with my mom .
absolutely not .
too much water dro@@ wns the miller .
who 's going to dro@@ wn ? mom did go to the er that day , and she 's in the hospital . mom did go to the er that day , and she 's in the hospital .
listen carefully .
if people find out that your mother is a f@@ ake patient , everything is over .
it will be totally over for you and me both , forever .
make no mist@@ akes .
the fate of you , me , and our drama depen@@ ds on today .
fate ?
yes , represent@@ ative .
was i right ?
i was right .
did you record their conversation as i told you to ?
yes .
good . send me a copy of that file , and i 'll text you director heo 's phone number , so send him a copy , too .
you still remember ... what i told you , right ?
if you want to live , just do as i say .
represent@@ ative !
what is it ?
i have something to tell you .
say it .
just a moment , can we talk privat@@ ely ?
since we 're busy now , let 's talk later .
this is the cell number of director heo .
ah , yes .
yes , yes ....
yes .
the blood test res@@ ult of hy@@ un min came out .
it 's 0.@@ 04 and lower than the lim@@ it !
okay .
now , we just need to finish this press conference well .
oh , thank you jesus !
are you ready ?
let 's go .
i , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , have lived getting gener@@ ous love from all the people for the last several years .
yes , represent@@ ative .
why has that file not been sent yet ?
that was ... because my cell phone wasn 't fully char@@ ged until now .
i will send you that file now . if someone has too many thoughts , he lo@@ ses many things as well , you know . you know what i mean , don 't you ?
in ad@@ dition , for all the diffic@@ ulti@@ es the production team of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " had to go through because of me , i 'm giving my sin@@ cere ap@@ ology to them .
so i drove the car myself .
[ voice message ]
[ voice message ] however , about my personal situation , i don 't want to make any exc@@ uses .
writ@@ er lee could 've been in a really dangerous situation .
why do you think i planned k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i ?
my target is anthony .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i case is just one of all means to hit that target .
lee go e@@ un was just an un@@ expected , s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at .
i don 't care who gets hurt , or who would be do@@ omed .
wo@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae , this bastard !
i don 't care .
this is the cell number of director heo .
what were you trying to say ?
i 'm sorry , represent@@ ative .
i got it .
in return , you do only what i tell you to do .
stop !
writ@@ er lee could 've been really in a danger .
represent@@ itive !
anthony !
in a press conference which is being ai@@ red live , a re@@ pres@@ n@@ tat@@ ive of a top-@@ class drama production company reve@@ als his own dirty trick to the nation himself . it could 've been a fun show , but luc@@ kil@@ y you stopped it . with that file , what are you going to do ?
that depen@@ ds on how you be@@ have from now on .
if you keep dig@@ ging into hy@@ un min 's mother 's case , i will reve@@ al this file .
then , the public will critic@@ ize you , and cha@@ ir@@ man will fire you who ru@@ ins the reputation of the company , just like he did fire me 3 years ago .
are you saying to make a deal with me ?
so you 're not as dum@@ b as i thought .
oh , and one more .
through all medias you 're de@@ aling with , friendly opin@@ ions about hy@@ un min will be poured out .
now , the combat between g@@ ladi@@ ators is finished . i will go back to the col@@ os@@ se@@ um and enjoy my victory , so you 'd better hurry up . however , based on all the critic@@ ism and ad@@ vice you 've given me ,
we will finish our press conference now .
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
are you okay ?
how was i ?
was i good ?
the best .
you were b@@ ada * * ! especially when you lowered your head for a moment , then , as you continued to talk , with tears ... ! it was art !
of course !
i had especially worked on that part .
have a seat !
where is anthony , anyway ?
what is the reaction of the repor@@ ters ?
much better than i had expected .
they 're already rele@@ asing sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic news re@@ ports .
- ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e !
- but let me make one thing clear .
i swear , i don 't care what kind of a life you lead .
it 's up to you whether you ru@@ in yourself with drug@@ s or gamb@@ le your life away . however , i will not toler@@ ate any mistake from you when you are kim wo@@ o jin of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
what did that lo@@ ony say ?
did you understand him ?
i sure didn 't !
con@@ gr@@ ats !
good job !
well , considering the blood test resul@@ ts and all , i think it 's ok to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min on board .
what do you think ?
it 's too early to tell yet .
what 's important is the public opinion . correct . the numbers may be legal@@ ly accep@@ table , but it 's still true that he drove after drinking alcohol .
i think it would be wise to watch the movement of the public opinion .
yes , - director .
i re@@ vie@@ wed the re@@ actions of the media re@@ ports and the ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s .
yes .
the voice of sym@@ pa@@ thy is deci@@ de@@ dly pre@@ domin@@ ant .
is that so ?
yes .
then , as planned , the november s@@ lot is reserv@@ ed for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " with k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
agreed ?
oh , hy@@ ung , look at this !
scr@@ oll up , up , up , oh , this one !
this one ! oh yes , that 's a good one !
nice shot !
it looks like you were crying .
really crying !
that tear is a real tear .
it 's worth a million dollars .
this is amazing !
take a look at this , director .
our hy@@ un min op@@ pa must have been in so much pain !
the ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s keep post@@ ing comm@@ ents .
hy@@ un min op@@ pa 's big heart is public knowledge .
good .
as you see , the public opinion about k@@ ang hy@@ un min is changed 180 de@@ gre@@ es over@@ night .
right now , ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s are sig@@ ning pet@@ itions to go against k@@ ang hy@@ un min being fired .
come in .
are you writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
who are you ?
please to meet you .
i 'm hy@@ un min 's mother .
if you 're hy@@ un min 's mother ...
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ... ?
yes .
super@@ star k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother .
you 're still weak , stay sitting !
you 're even more sick than i am ; i can 't stay sitting .
well , i am sick .
even if i 'm a f@@ ake patient .
what are you talking about ?
you know .
flowers ?
yes , director .
we 've decided to go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min as previ@@ ously planned .
i understand .
you don 't seem too happy .
no , i am happy .
very happy .
by any chance , is this what you 've already anticip@@ ated ?
what do you mean ?
no , never@@ mind . then , see you later .
the station 's drama department decided to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
what is that reaction ?
do you have something you haven 't told me ?
something i haven 't told you ?
what ?
what is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother just came by .
how could you trick me like that ?
it 's fine now that you know .
how can you say something like that ?
if i told you honestly , would you have agreed obe@@ di@@ ently ?
no !
i would never have particip@@ ated in such a far@@ ce !
no , i would 've dis@@ su@@ ade you not to do that !
see !
you 're really im@@ moral .
turning someone 's perfectly fine mother into a seriously ill person in a second wasn 't enough ?
som@@ ed@@ ay , she will be seriously ill , i guess .
for your drama , you 've thrown away your father , now it 's your mother ?
because a husband and a wife are equ@@ al .
get out .
i don 't even want to look at you , so get out !
i 'm busy anyway , so i can 't stay longer .
ah , that devil !
this devil will go back to home to hell now , so you 'd better write the script for episode 6 .
is he crazy or something ?
what do i do ?
hello .
-@@ hello .
what 's that ?
this is the letter he@@ e j@@ ae left .
without saying anything , he said he 's going to re@@ sign for personal reasons .
hey .
what is this ?
to writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ? represent@@ ative , i 'm not brave enough to meet you in person , so i 'm telling you like this .
over that last few months , re@@ pres@@ ant@@ ative , who treated me so well and to the people in world production with an ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic heart , i 'm a sin@@ ner . the fact that i will not rece@@ ive for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess even with any exc@@ uses ,
i know that very well .
so i , somebody pa@@ the@@ tic , will be leaving .
our writ@@ er 's preci@@ ous drama , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
i will pr@@ ay that it will be succes@@ s@@ ful .
be heal@@ thy .
writ@@ er lee !
you 've been well ?
you must still be sick ; you should have told us before you came .
i 'm better now .
you want me to forgive him ?
yes .
i know you 're really disap@@ pointed and angry , but can 't you forgive him ?
no .
a person who betr@@ ays once will betr@@ ay again .
you make a mistake once .
and he@@ e j@@ ae , he 's having a hard time , living with his sick grand@@ ma these days .
that 's why he must have been gre@@ edy from his you@@ th@@ ful passion .
he 's reg@@ ret@@ ting it right now .
what does that have to do with me ?
he 's already fired .
so don 't but@@ t into my business , and you do your work .
why did he get fired ?
actually , i don 't really know myself .
that bastard ... even when i ask , he doesn 't reply .
he doesn 't even pick up his phone anymore .
do you possibly know his address ?
grand@@ ma .
do you possibly know this house , # 30 ?
that 's our house .
we don 't have any coffee mu@@ gs ... no , it 's fine .
this is good too .
by the way , where 's he@@ e j@@ ae ?
he hasn 't come home from work yet .
it 's about time for him to come home .
by the way , didn 't you say you 're working with him ?
oh , i 'm on a vac@@ ation .
it 's so strange today .
a lot of people from work vis@@ ited .
really ?
w@@ h ... who was it ?
they didn 't tell me their name , but ... they said to send this on to him .
ah grand@@ ma , do you mind if i read that ? yes , yes . because of my ey@@ es@@ ight , even if i read it , i wouldn 't know what it was about .
shut up and come to work early , before i really fire you .
grandmother , i 'm here .
writ@@ er lee .
[ lo@@ ony ]
what ?
what are you doing ?
whatever i 'm doing , why do you have to know that ?
just ...
have you re@@ considered about he@@ e j@@ ae ?
that betr@@ ayer will come to work again .
well done .
earlier , he came to me and beg@@ ged me to let him work again , crying over and over .
so , is that the reason you took him back ?
no , i just decided to use him for only three months .
don 't worry about us@@ eless things , and if you have time to make a call , just write scrip@@ ts .
wait a moment .
one more thing .
what else ?
why did you lie ?
are you talking about that again ?
rein@@ stat@@ ing me as a writ@@ er was done by you , not the director of the drama department .
i never did that .
tell me .
why did you lie ? i guess you heard some weird ru@@ mor , but stop talking non@@ sense , and just write more scrip@@ ts .
because i 'm blind , i only see you .
because my heart is frozen , i hug you .
when my trembling lips touch your ears , i say the words i dre@@ amed of ...
good morning !
since i first met you , i love you .
who are you , huh ?
this br@@ at !
huh ?
welcome back !
... those words that came out as tears little by little , fill up my heart as if my heart will explo@@ de with those words .
because both of my eyes are blin@@ ded ,
okay , then let 's go for our other half face , the main female act@@ ress .
yes .
kim ah jo@@ ong will work a movie with 16 million won budget next month .
and lee bo young is staying ab@@ road now after fin@@ ishing the last drama so succes@@ s@@ fully .
kim se@@ on ah , who is so hot these days , is already sched@@ ul@@ ed for a drama which will be ai@@ red wed@@ nes@@ day@@ -@@ thur@@ s@@ day in m broadcasting , so she 's not avail@@ able . and je@@ on ji hy@@ un has a casting in@@ quir@@ y from hollywood now , so she 's waiting for its fin@@ aliz@@ ation . and the last , e@@ om ji won , who is doing both tv and movie a lot these days , is done film@@ ing a movie now and re@@ vie@@ wing scrip@@ ts for the next project .
she says she will never work with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , even if she dies .
why is sung min ah not on this list ?
i heard her sched@@ ule is avail@@ able as well .
that 's because ... she 's an act@@ ress of empire production .
she can 't work with us because she belong@@ s to empire ?
yes , because our company is not on good ter@@ ms with empire .
more ac@@ cur@@ ately , anthony and oh jin wan are enem@@ ies so it won 't work , right ?
but why does it ... have anything to do with me ? crazy dog , you told me that if i give up that moment@@ ary 5 minutes , you will make sure that i will forget the past 5 years by the joy of succes@@ s . to taste that joy ,
no matter what .
look at me now ( in french )
wow , you are too good .
miss min ah , you 're fantast@@ ic , yes , great !
great pose , ok , yes ! now , ready , 1,2 . good !
you worked well .
it 's done for today .
good job .
- you all worked hard .
good job .
miss min ah , you were amazing today , as always .
i didn 't do much .
it 's all thanks to your great work of photo@@ graphy .
aig@@ oo , you 're even mo@@ dest !
sung min ah is indeed the best .
thanks for your work today .
don 't you ever sched@@ ule another shoot with that man .
why not ?
did he do something wrong ?
i can 't concentr@@ ate because of his bad breath !
alright , i 'll look into it .
a s@@ killed photo@@ grap@@ her who doesn 't have bad breath , ok ?
why don 't you guys go ahead .
it has been a long time .
you haven 't changed .
you 're still good at surpris@@ ing people .
take this .
what is that ?
it 's the script for the mini series for november mon@@ days and tu@@ es@@ days of s broadcasting .
i did hear that you were broke .
i guess that means your scale has shr@@ unk , too ?
for you to offer me a script of a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
compar@@ ed to the pa@@ the@@ tic writ@@ ers of empire who haven 't written anything wor@@ thy of the return of sung min ah for the past three years , it 's completely different .
what to do ?
in ad@@ dition to writ@@ ers , i also screen produ@@ cer@@ s .
is there anything else you need to know about me ?
how much are you going to pay me ?
as much as you want .
you can 't af@@ ford that , ever .
sure i can . because you 're the best act@@ ress , sung min ah .
read it carefully and give me a call .
my number hasn 't changed .
who is it ?
who ... who is it ?
did i star@@ tle you ?
i 'm just te@@ asing .
quite spac@@ ious for a writ@@ er 's studio .
about the same size as ... the second bathroom of my living room .
quit mo@@ cking , it 's my very first studio .
why have you come ?
well , just , uh@@ m ...
i thought i 'd check out the writ@@ er 's studio .
i heard that ... you saw my mom .
yes , i did .
i also received great words of wis@@ dom .
hey , you know it was in@@ evit@@ able .
thank you .
i normally don 't say thank you very often .
thank you .
i truly appreciate what you did this time .
i feel as if ...
i found a new friend .
then , be good from now on .
yeah , about that ...
wouldn 't it be better to take out that sw@@ im@@ ming at sea part ?
i 'd love it if that part was cut out from the whole script !
i don 't know about the others , but you absolutely have to sw@@ im in the ocean .
absolutely !
is that all ?
you said you can af@@ ford to pay me because i 'm the best act@@ ress there is .
yes .
then , let me ask you one thing .
do you still ... love me ?
if you would act for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
pre@@ view ep 8 how much longer do i have to ba@@ the those fil@@ thy br@@ ats ?
episode 8 rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements will not come hy@@ ung , why is he so late returning ? that 's what i 'm saying .
it has already been for more than 5 hours since he left to meet her . um ... represent@@ ative ?
what ? it 's nothing . pd jo@@ o .
yes .
quickly write a news release and circul@@ ate it to these media compan@@ ies i checked , the first thing in the morning tomorrow .
but ... what article are you talking about ?
the title is like this :
sung min ah confir@@ med as " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's " lead act@@ ress .
huh ?
an article about sung min ah join@@ ing our drama ?
sung min ah has decided to do our drama .
quickly get started on writing the news release . good work ,
crazy dog .
are you now ready to taste that joy ?
that 's right .
it 's now satisfac@@ tory .
what say you , feeling good ?
the best , that 's my feeling . even if anthony is very nast@@ y and mean , if you look into him , isn 't he a pretty okay produc@@ er ?
yes .
sometimes i want to beat him up , but like today he 's quite an okay produc@@ er .
by the way , when was the last time you took a bath ?
i ba@@ the every@@ day .
but i 'm not scr@@ ub@@ bing often .
no wonder ...
how can it be a human body ?
this is an er@@ as@@ er !
just kid@@ ding around .
bath over !
good bye .
b@@ ye-@@ bye hy@@ un wo@@ o .
don 't catch a cold .
oh , really nice !
why are you here ?
it 's my turn .
teacher , please let me take a break for a moment .
we 're just going to the bathroom for a second .
yes .
for how long do i have to wash dirty , dead skin@@ ned ras@@ c@@ als ?
you decided to do volun@@ te@@ er work for the meaning of self-@@ refle@@ ction .
do you think i 'm asking because i don 't know ?
! it would be enough to just shoot a few photos .
how much are you going to push me ?
! you , listen to me carefully .
in order for you to protect your image as a lead actor which you ru@@ ined you are not only scr@@ ub@@ bing body gr@@ ime but also sha@@ ving your hair . ( word play in kore@@ an )
my hair ?
right . even if you have to show them sha@@ ving your hair , you have to show them that you 're self-@@ reflec@@ ting .
i 'll just s@@ cru@@ b off dead skin .
good .
s@@ cru@@ b it off with all your might .
what 's with you ?
eat it .
what ?
i told you to eat it .
if he gives you something to eat , you should eat it .
director !
sung min ah ?
are you saying that sung min ah got cast@@ ed ?
right .
korea 's top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min with the best , sung min ah .
this is great !
we have the best casting combin@@ ation , right ?
hy@@ ung !
seems like you should come back . the kids are getting cold waiting .
ok , all right .
i 'll go and s@@ cru@@ b off those er@@ as@@ ers .
get going .
yes .
no way !
even if i don 't know anything else but this . even if i don 't know anything else but this .
with anthony 's drama you definitely can 't .
why ?
are you asking because you don 't know ?
! you always said this when i was a ro@@ o@@ kie .
this is a royal order .
shut your mouth and do what i tell you .
now i give the royal orders .
meet all the conditions they request , and proce@@ ed the contr@@ act .
what ?
i definitely told you .
i told you to proce@@ ed with the contr@@ act .
why on earth are you being like this ?
have you forgotten what anthony did to you ?
! one more thing .
don 't ask me for my reasons from now on .
if you want to continue to keep me under contr@@ act .
our af@@ fili@@ ated act@@ ress sung min ah is doing anthony 's drama ?
i 'm sorry .
even though i told her no , it 's what she wants .
no matter what it takes , i will stop her from acting in that drama .
no .
let her have her way .
par@@ don ?
what do you mean ...
the attack is allowed just once .
in this one opportunity , it 's important to go for the kill .
if you say " the only opportunity of attack .. " ?
where did you say the invest@@ or of anthony 's drama was ?
top@@ star sung min ah confir@@ med for ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong@@ '
set up the date for the script practice session and the drama press conference on 19@@ th .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min sung min ah
lead actor and act@@ ress of ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
no@@ tif@@ y the sched@@ ule to all media compan@@ ies , ac@@ tors , ac@@ tres@@ ses and staf@@ fs .
sung min ah 's drama come@@ back after 3 years don 't forget to send an invit@@ ation respec@@ t@@ fully to wat@@ an@@ abe group , the invest@@ or .
yes !
drama " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ultra@@ -@@ lux@@ ury casting yes , reporter park .
have you been well ?
this is world production calling .
i 'm sorry but as it was too ur@@ gent .
how is it going with our invit@@ ation cards ?
yes , please send them by 12@@ pm .
represent@@ ative !
the sun has ris@@ en a while ago .
stop sleeping , get up and get ready to go out .
where are we going ?
sung min ah said she wanted to meet you .
sung min ah ?
what is sung min ah 's character like ?
probably better than yours .
i read from an article that she is very though@@ t@@ ful .
hello ! i 'm lee go e@@ un .
you 're younger than i thought .
alright , let 's get some fresh air . you two have a chat .
i read and liked the script .
it 's been a long time since a script made me gre@@ edy like this one .
thank you .
but ...
yes ?
if there 's a problem ...
i 'm talking about episode one .
don 't you think that 's too much of the theme ?
too much of the theme ?
" a man 's sor@@ row@@ ful life story who lives in the dark age . "
the theme should th@@ ic@@ ken as time passes , not sho@@ wn all at once like that .
that 's why i decided to start by expl@@ aining the background with the charac@@ ters around the main guy .
that 's not what i 'm saying .
then ... the role of jin h@@ ye rim i 'm taking on , she 's not at all in episode one and appe@@ ars last in episode two .
if you brought an act@@ ress who is paid many tens of thous@@ ands won , you have to show her for the amount of time that f@@ its her price .
what are you im@@ ply ...
the female lead isn 't the male lead 's ma@@ id of hon@@ our .
to fit the name of sung min ah , rev@@ ise the script starting with episode one .
i fully understand what you 've said .
but the planned story line is ...
writ@@ er lee .
yes .
under whom did you learn ?
why are you asking ?
just like i thought , you really sm@@ ack of a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
i will make this clear .
you did not cast me .
i chose you . no , i chose this drama .
so right now i 'm not asking a fav@@ our .
i am not trying to give you ad@@ vice either .
so you 're saying right now that we don 't have a choice ?
it seems you 're not too much of a fool .
do you always crus@@ h writ@@ ers like that ?
no .
i didn 't need to .
the writ@@ ers i worked with up to now were veter@@ ans .
so they were aware and did all that was needed .
the ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er who knows nothing will only say one thing .
this drama is not a drama for you alone .
even if it 's for sung min ah , i can 't fix even one character .
you can 't fix it ?
yes .
for an actor who is full of ego@@ ist@@ ic pride and doesn 't think about the whole drama it 's un@@ necessary .
you look like you ended your chat well ...
yes .
very well .
you knew , right ?
what ?
do you know what sung min ah said to me ?
what could she have said . to match the role to the worth of her name .
by bringing me even when you knew that , i guess you tried to shake up my script again with the act@@ ress this time ? what could she have said . to match the role to the worth of her name .
by bringing me even when you knew that , i guess you tried to shake up my script again with the act@@ ress this time ? do you think that way ?
i was wrong for trust@@ ing you .
so ... what have you decided to do ?
who did you say was the new director of s broadcasting ?
okay , let 's see .
well done .
oh . make it possible to film this part also .
there will be a hidden scene behind the building .
i 've got it .
good , i think it 's done here , so ...
let 's go to jin h@@ ye rim 's room .
oh , writ@@ er lee !
hello .
oh , why are you here instead of writing ?
so it 's like that .
what 's the best thing to do , director ?
what did crazy dog say ?
it 's us@@ eless to hear from him . they planned together to change up my script .
ac@@ tors and ac@@ tres@@ ses are so weird .
sometimes , they run into the fire for their pieces , and ... even with not eating and staying up all night , they dedic@@ ate to their roles . but what i 'm saying is this .
there is something that the ac@@ tors never give up .
what is that ?
the ten@@ ac@@ ity toward their roles .
in other words , they never step back when it 's about getting their por@@ tion .
why is it like that ?
well ...
that 's just their nature .
with the natural ten@@ ac@@ ity they have , they accompl@@ ish their jobs .
they are like animals with the only instinc@@ t for acting .
then can 't we change their instinc@@ t ?
changing the instinc@@ t ...
that 's difficult even for me .
director !
all these are part of the strugg@@ les .
i wish you a good luck .
yes , director .
yes !
ah , writ@@ er lee . come in .
so , i 'll get going .
are you ?
no need to see me off .
i 'll contact you .
yes .
writ@@ er lee , have a seat .
yes .
i heard briefly about it .
yes .
right .
i myself am a drama cre@@ ator also , so i sympath@@ ise with your point of view and i 'm ro@@ oting for you .
thank you .
but now i 'll talk to you as the director of this drama 's broadcasting station .
sung min ah is an act@@ ress which all broad@@ ca@@ sters want to acqu@@ ire .
you know that , right ?
yes .
sung min ah 's dem@@ and is a dem@@ and that is totally under@@ stand@@ able from the point of view of a lead act@@ ress .
i hope you consider this point .
did you listen well to what the broadcasting director said ?
do you have to use your strength to pressure me like that ?
yes .
if i say that i do .
let 's talk for a while , us .
our conversation is possible after the revis@@ ed script comes out .
i clearly told you , i have not agreed to modi@@ f@@ ying the script .
you .
don 't act up .
your talent is quite something .
first writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , now even up to sung min ah .
you return the people whom you threw away col@@ dly back to your people .
you don 't person@@ ally need to get an infer@@ ior@@ ity complex . if there is one thing that i don 't have , it would be the infer@@ ior@@ ity complex that you stup@@ id@@ ly gras@@ p on .
that 's not an infer@@ ior@@ ity complex , it 's called fury .
don 't make the mistake of thinking that you 've already won .
i never tried to win against you . i am not doing that now , nor will i ever do that .
someone like you can 't become my target .
what to do ?
you 're my target .
then someone who failed with the target right in front of him , must be feeling frustr@@ ated .
laugh as much as you can while it last@@ s .
there will be a day when you will be stom@@ ped on sever@@ ely .
sang ta@@ e gu .
this is also so-@@ so . something else .
bit na .
you said this op@@ pa is aw@@ esome in whatever i wear .
but why is this not good ?
because you 're cool it 's just so-@@ so .
if that ch@@ ick sung min ah falls for you then what ?
then it can 't be helped .
op@@ pa !
op@@ pa is many people 's man .
and op@@ pa belong@@ s to bit na . don 't you know that ?
we 're just shooting a drama po@@ ster .
from now until the drama ends ... that bitch sung min ah will be stuck to you thro@@ ugh@@ out !
then would you rather have me wear out@@ f@@ its like a beg@@ gar while i film the drama ?
then promise . that you won 't look at that ch@@ ick first .
instead of a promise i 'll give you an o@@ ath .
that 's enough , right ? sung min ah is known for her pun@@ ctu@@ ality , but even if i step on hard , i think we will still be late about 20 minutes .
why are you stepping on ?
go slowly .
what ?
if the main actor k@@ ang hy@@ un min is late , even if it 's not 20 minutes but one hour they have to wait .
even if she 's hot these days , is she this drama 's protagon@@ ist ? if we pr@@ aise her all the time and do whatever she wants just because she is an act@@ ress , it will spo@@ il her . from the beginning , bam !
we should tam@@ e her .
run slowly , kw@@ ang so@@ o !
as for the po@@ ster 's theme this time , what about this ?
in this mood ... - no , i pre@@ fer this one .
will that be ok ?
what ?
what ? sung min ah ke@@ eps her ap@@ point@@ ments as shar@@ ply as a knife ?
so , didn 't i tell you to run slowly or what ?
kw@@ ang so@@ o ?
i tried to come as slowly as possible , but ...
sung min ah arrived !
hello , director .
oh , cp , hello ! - wow , you look fantast@@ ic !
you 're the best .
sorry i 'm a bit late .
no , it 's okay . do the mak@@ e-@@ up and the shooting will start right away .
yes .
- see you at the shooting studio .
min ah .
seems like you 're not good at keeping ap@@ point@@ ments .
sorry . then ...
see ?
dej@@ ec@@ ting her with simple and impact words .
she 's totally dej@@ ec@@ ted .
yes , president .
now almost all ac@@ tors have been decided , only the date that we start shooting is left .
so this is no les@@ ser than anthony .
it is pre@@ poster@@ ous , but there is one thing i have to tell you ...
let 's hear it . we may be a bit later that the shooting date that is speci@@ fied in the contr@@ act details , is that going to be alright ?
seeing how met@@ icul@@ ously you have done the prepar@@ ations , that is possible .
don 't pay too much attention to it .
thank you very much !
yes .
see you at the production report conference .
oh , good !
wow , whatever the camera takes is totally like a master@@ piece !
it 's killing !
hey , this ... this one ...
good !
good ! oh , min ah , it was a good shot !
okay !
good !
do it proper@@ ly .
act ... ion !
wow , this one is great , isn 't it , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ?
wow , whatever the camera takes is the piece , piece !
you worked hard , director .
well done , well done .
what did i do today ?
this is a piece of cake compar@@ ed to the up@@ coming brut@@ al sched@@ ule .
but ... you asked for a script change ?
i heard it from the broad@@ caster .
yes .
i thought it would be better if a few points were amen@@ ded .
i wish the change to be complet@@ ed before the script reading session , but writ@@ er lee seemed to have a lot of thoughts in her mind .
please talk to her well .
then ... ah , yes , yes .
you can leave .
ais@@ h , writ@@ er lee , this ...
if she 's asked for a script change , she should rev@@ ise it ! she 's not y@@ iel@@ ding again ! sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ,
i think you should step in here . what do you mean " step in " ?
well , writ@@ er lee , that kid@@ do , she 's quite dar@@ ing , sometimes . -@@ last time , when director moon ...
she 's not dar@@ ing , but per@@ sever@@ ing .
without that much back@@ bone , how can she write scrip@@ ts ?
no , that ... that ... ah , really ... sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im !
hy@@ ung !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
who on earth hi@@ red that photo@@ grap@@ her ?
why ? like a di@@ e-@@ for fan of sung min ah , he kept saying min ah , min ah ...
min ah ...
it was so anno@@ ying i though i was going to die ! hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung !
as you were not at the mak@@ e-@@ up room , i thought you left .
yes . anyway , since we 're going to spend a lot of time together from now on , let 's get along well .
i 'm sorry . my hands are a bit dirty ...
then ... what was that ?
is she ... ?
is she really refus@@ ing the hand@@ shake of this super@@ star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
crazy ...
aren 't you dis@@ regar@@ ding him a bit too much ?
he 's just a pu@@ pp@@ y@@ ish br@@ at who thinks he 's an actor .
he 's not even worth conver@@ sing with .
yes , chief produc@@ er .
writ@@ er lee .
are you in your right mind ?
par@@ don ?
what do you ... mean ?
sung min ah of all people is asking for a script revision .
why can 't you y@@ ield ?
why ?
! no need to talk more . as per sung min ah 's request , change the script .
it doesn 't suit you .
in a building that doesn 't suit you at all and the sha@@ b@@ by office ...
did you come to confir@@ m that ?
that writ@@ er ...
how is she ?
exactly , the same as you see .
she just has her tem@@ per , not comprom@@ ising .
can you fire that writ@@ er ?
i 'm asking if you can fire her for me .
what are you talking about ?
who knows .
i just wanted to know your thoughts .
before that let me ask something as well .
what are you going to do if lee go e@@ un won 't change her script to the end ?
the things i want , i get all of them , as you know . of course ,
i couldn 't have only one person , though .
in the future it will be difficult as well .
i know .
that you don 't feel or want such a thing like love .
but i don 't care .
because i will make you love me .
after all , that was what i thought .
you were trying to shake the scrip@@ ts as you want by a sch@@ eme with sung min ah .
there was no such intention at all .
but it 's clear that it was pre@@ determined .
it was pre@@ determined ?
sung min ah is an act@@ ress in the position who can choose not only her co-@@ star but also the writ@@ er .
this is the in@@ evit@@ able process we should en@@ dure from the moment sung min ah was cast .
you promised me that you wouldn 't touch the script .
i definitely did .
but now you 're telling me to change it , even by using the act@@ ress , manag@@ ers of the broadcasting station !
i have not told you to fix the script even once .
what did you say ?
fighting with a director , strugg@@ ling with a produc@@ er , being interfer@@ ed by the broadcasting station , and having a power game with ac@@ tors consist@@ ently are a drama writ@@ er 's fate !
that 's why i was once fired by the pressure from the broadcasting station , and fought with you all the time , represent@@ ative .
now i 'm fighting with the act@@ ress .
right now , you know i would obviously lose , so you 're telling me there is no need to fight .
no !
fight !
fight open@@ ly on the square against her !
you said you wanted to protect your script .
so fight . fight and win !
but in return , you 're fighting alone .
no one at all will help you .
so ... being a writ@@ er is an infin@@ it@@ ely lonely job .
oh , right now ?
yes . understood .
represent@@ ative .
it was cp lee sung g@@ yu that just called .
he wants you to come to the station right now .
right now ?
he wants to talk with you about the production budget .
fight !
face the challenge and fight on !
you said you want to protect your script , right ?
then , fight . fight and win .
however , you 'll be fighting on your own .
not a single soul will help you .
writ@@ er lee .
jo@@ o pd .
i have a favor to ask of you .
that does not make sense .
it 's a period piece with k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah as the lead@@ s .
you got 10 bil@@ lion won from the spon@@ sor , you have enough to cus@@ hi@@ on that ! that 10 bil@@ lion is only an invest@@ ment that needs to be returned to the produc@@ er once the drama is finished .
well , that .. that is true .
of course , i know that .
total production cost is 9.@@ 8 bil@@ lion .
the 300 million per episode makes 6 bil@@ lion .
projec@@ ted international sales is 1.7 bil@@ lion .
cable network sales is 10 bil@@ lion .
that 's only 8.@@ 7 bil@@ lion in total .
you want me to take a defic@@ it of 1.1 bil@@ lion won ?
no ... you want me to take a defic@@ it of 1.1 bil@@ lion won ? no ...
that 's not what i mean ...
no ...
that 's right !
produc@@ t plac@@ ements ! you can get money that way !
the histor@@ ical setting is during japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation . produc@@ t plac@@ ements are not vi@@ able !
that ...
i see .
i 'll talk with the director in person .
represent@@ ative kim ...
why do you have to give us so much trouble ?
just go easy on us .
and besides , the director is not in his office at the moment .
hey , hey , hey , wait .
it 's my treat .
are you putting it on the corpor@@ ate card as the director ?
hey , i don 't use the corpor@@ ate card on my personal business .
install@@ ments for 3 months , please .
hey , what is wan so@@ o doing ?
un@@ emplo@@ yed .
represent@@ ative kim , what br@@ ings you here ?
i came to see you , director .
i 'm sorry .
i guess i need to talk with him .
alright , i will see you later .
i 'll call you
- okay .
what is it ? is it ur@@ gent ?
it 's about the production cost of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
if it 's about the production cost , it 's no use for you to come here , represent@@ ative kim .
it 's been already decided , as you know .
i don 't understand why you 're giving us an amount similar to small dram@@ as like " children of paradise . "
do you think that drama will gu@@ aran@@ tee as much commercial adver@@ tis@@ ement profit as my drama ?
probably not .
but that is why that drama is important to us as well .
because nobody invest@@ s money in it .
nobody expec@@ ts it to make any money .
if you know that it 's not going to make any money , why do it ?
because the world today desperately needs that drama . understood ?
are you saying that " morning of k@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ ong " is not a drama the world needs ?
no , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has its own value , too , that the world can benef@@ it from .
plus , it 's got commercial potential as well .
it 's a great drama .
however , even dram@@ as that nobody thinks will make money need to be produc@@ ed , is what i think .
not for prof@@ its , but for its benef@@ its to the society .
do you enjoy playing hol@@ ier@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ th@@ ou like that ? sure , i suppose someone like you wouldn 't know the joy in it .
sure .
it seems that the mas@@ sage place is the most likely place at that hour .
welcome .
may i see your member id ?
miss sung min ah is inside , right ?
i 'm here to see miss sung min ah .
a visit@@ or ?
who ?
lee go e@@ un , she said you know her .
tell her exactly what i say .
she said that unless you brought the changed script , she won 't see you , so you should leave .
yes .
ah , hey !
- i 'm sorry . - please , stop !
i 'm sorry .
- you can 't do this !
it 's an emergen@@ cy .
listen , stop ... !
here you are .
i 'm so sorry .
get out of here , now !
just one moment .
you 're quite an interesting person .
i 'm more interesting once you get to know me better .
can you give us some priv@@ acy ?
now , enter@@ tain me .
i 'm not making dram@@ as as a char@@ ity .
yes , i know very well that all you live for is money , represent@@ ative kim . oh , and also , from now on , any business about the drama should be communic@@ ated through the cp in charge .
aig@@ oo , fan@@ cy meeting you here !
director nam wo@@ on young !
though i 'm rather late , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations on your promotion to director .
i suppose you are late . thanks anyway .
i see , you hate me .
why would i do that ?
you 're at the top of the food chain in the drama world .
well then , excuse me ...
long time no see .
let me give you a warning .
leave this field while i 'm still being civil .
you 're the one whose time has come to retire , cha@@ ir@@ man .
i decide my own destiny .
i can also decide your destiny .
and what are you going to decide ?
just wait .
you 'll find out soon enough .
i look forward to it .
that 's why you can 't accept it .
yes .
you know the ris@@ ks involved with that decision .
why ins@@ ist ?
why are you ris@@ king your job for this ? the legen@@ dary british actor alec guinness once said , " there 's no such thing as a small part .
you 're trying to school me ?
didn 't you decide to take this part after reading the original script ? you found worth and potential in the details of the script , then , you shouldn 't acti@@ vely se@@ ek to ru@@ in the potential you saw in it .
it would be bad for you yourself , too .
also ... there will be no revision of scrip@@ ts .
so you can drink so@@ ju too .
what 's the res@@ ult of the fight ?
i heard from pd jo@@ o that you went to see sung min ah .
there will be no revis@@ ions on scrip@@ ts .
and sung min ah will atten@@ d neither the script reading session nor the production report conference tomorrow .
yes , she will atten@@ d .
why do you think so ?
because sung min ah is a professional .
profession@@ als have infin@@ ite sense of respon@@ sibil@@ ity about their work .
a profes@@ sion with sense of respon@@ sibil@@ ity is doing this for her own interest only ?
both a professional and an amateur , they all make a mistake .
then , an amateur bl@@ ames the world , but a professional takes time in reflec@@ ting on herself / himself .
take time ... ?
that 's right .
time which an amateur like you wouldn 't dare to think about .
both a professional and an amateur , they all make a mistake .
then , an amateur bl@@ ames the world , but a professional takes time in reflec@@ ting on herself / himself .
time which an amateur like you wouldn 't dare to think about .
i mean , episode 1 , don 't you think it shows it 's theme exces@@ si@@ vely ?
finally , the first day of the official sched@@ ule for the drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is starting .
at 2 pm , meeting all ac@@ tors and reading the scrip@@ ts . at 5 pm , moving to the audit@@ orium and having the production report conference .
from now on , everyone , remember exactly what you have to do and proce@@ ed without fa@@ il .
yes , i understand !
go@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae , set up the room for reading scrip@@ ts by 2 pm .
manager park , check the ac@@ tors as per their sched@@ ule and make calls to confir@@ m .
ah , yes , so you 're on your way here ?
pd jo@@ o , go to the audit@@ orium directly , and check all the details for the last time .
the main po@@ ster on the background must be placed with extreme care .
yes , reporter park !
manager han , call all repor@@ ters of media compan@@ ies and portal sites , and get their anticip@@ ated questions in advan@@ ce .
yes .
now , i think you should go to the reading room .
okay .
ah , and wat@@ an@@ abe group contac@@ ted me , and told me that cha@@ ir@@ man won 't be able to come .
i see .
when would he arrive ?
it will be at 2 : 35@@ pm .
but .. do you have to pick him up person@@ ally , cha@@ ir@@ man ?
to the airport , i can go ...
the leader of wat@@ an@@ abe group which asse@@ ts are worth of 60 bil@@ lion yen ( about us $ 730 million ) is coming , so i should show some cour@@ tes@@ y to him at least .
what is with that face ?
i made a revision on the script .
these are the revis@@ ed version of episode 1 and 2 of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
revision ?
why did you change your mind ?
yesterday , i went back home and took time to read them again .
and ?
i could see that .
the exces@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of theme .
so , do these scrip@@ ts not have exces@@ sive theme any longer ?
i will show the comple@@ tion of theme at the last episode .
you sound pretty confid@@ ent .
if i weren 't confid@@ ent , i wouldn 't have even started it .
how is it ?
this ro@@ o@@ kie is pretty good .
her writing s@@ kill is quite wor@@ kab@@ le .
ah ... this is not good .
what is it ?
does it make sense ?
does she have any brain or not ?
hy@@ un min , even so , shouldn 't you read the revis@@ ed script before the reading session ? hy@@ ung , in a car , why would i read it , hur@@ ting my eyes ?
i can read it when i get there .
what do you think ?
can 't you know by just sm@@ elling it ?
that this is quite something ?
what are you doing ?
you should print out the new scrip@@ ts !
yes . by the way , you 're not even on episode 1 , but you came quite early .
you could 've come 1 hour late .
what was that ?
ais@@ h , with my tem@@ per , i just should 've ...
go inside first . you were so confid@@ ent , but i guess you were scared after all .
yes , i was scared .
i was scared if i would lose the compo@@ sure of my life .
thank you all for coming here for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
now , let 's start the reading session for episode 1 and episode 2 .
well , episode 1 of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
scene 1 , panor@@ ama of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong city , li@@ vely k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong city is sho@@ wn .
on the road , a stre@@ et@@ car is passing , and many pe@@ dest@@ ri@@ ans between r@@ ick@@ sha@@ ws .
then a cu@@ t-@@ in , " november 7@@ th , 1938 . "
one man who walks through a crowd , it 's the main role , kim wo@@ o jin . wo@@ o jin , he looks around for a moment , then appro@@ aches to a pe@@ dd@@ ler whose face is covered with a towel .
what do you think the weather of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong would be tomorrow ? he looks around for a moment , then appro@@ aches to a pe@@ dd@@ ler whose face is covered with a towel . what do you think the weather of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong would be tomorrow ?
a pe@@ dd@@ ler , looking around for a moment , pulls out something from the inside pocket and gives it to wo@@ o jin . wo@@ o jin , getting close his face to that pe@@ dd@@ ler .
there must be one more .
the pe@@ dd@@ ler , opening the to@@ wel@@ s which covered the face , is the main female role , jin h@@ ye rin .
the other one will arrive tonight .
it will come out at midnight , through the check register machine .
wo@@ o jin , after taking a moment to think something , whispers .
wo@@ o jin , after taking a moment to think something , whispers . mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , it 's your turn to read .
what 's wrong with you ?
what 's wrong with me ?
when i said i wouldn 't sw@@ im in the sea , you didn 't even sn@@ iff , but now without my per@@ mission , you were totally seduc@@ ed by that fox and changed all scrip@@ ts .
and now what ?
what 's wrong with me ?
i can 't do with these scrip@@ ts . no ,
i won 't .
director , i 'm sorry .
with this feeling , i can 't do this , either .
so , it 's finally started .
par@@ don ?
what do you mean ?
every@@ time , whenever the drama starts , this happens , the war of ner@@ ves among animals .
par@@ don ?
pd jo@@ o , do you know where we are ?
this is a jungle made of as@@ ph@@ alt .
what are you doing now ?
are you asking that because you don 't know ?
lower your voice .
don 't you see those repor@@ ters ?
smile . and relax your har@@ den@@ ed face first .
if we 're not going to use the original scrip@@ ts , i won 't be able to smile comfor@@ tab@@ ly .
never .
until when will you wh@@ ine all the time , without thinking straight ?
do you think i 'm now wh@@ in@@ ing ?
this way , please .
ah , here is col@@ der than fuku@@ oka .
ah , yes .
the president of the best broadcasting station in korea came himself to welcome us .
since you 're coming , of course , i should come welcome you , cha@@ ir@@ man .
thank you .
this is the president of s@@ bc .
and this is the son of wat@@ an@@ abe , the he@@ ir of wat@@ an@@ abe group , mr. wat@@ an@@ abe ken@@ ji .
ah , i see . nice to meet you .
my name is je@@ ong ji hy@@ un .
nice to meet you . ( in kore@@ an )
i 'm wat@@ an@@ abe ken@@ ji .
you 're speaking kore@@ an very well .
because i have business in korea too .
please keep making invest@@ ments for our future kore@@ an dram@@ as too .
let 's go inside .
yes , this way .
so what do you want me to do ?
are you saying i should go back in ?
the production announ@@ cement is soon .
should i go out there alone ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is going to come .
i trust our re@@ p will bring him back .
so , please , come back in .
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i thought i warned you already .
don 't act up .
that 's not it
this is a favor .
i guess this drama is nothing to you as if it 's a children 's play . the penal@@ ty of three times of 2 bil@@ lion won you received for this drama , if you 're not going to bring that 6 bil@@ lion won back , go back to that room immediately .
i didn 't say i wouldn 't play for this drama .
i said i can 't do it with that revis@@ ed script .
why don 't you go back when i say nic@@ ely ?
why ?
will you punch me otherwise ?
what are you doing ?
i can make it even worse ! using your perfectly fine mother to cover up your du@@ i case , should i sp@@ ill it all out that it 's all f@@ ake ? leave if you can , and i will tell people everything in that press conference .
are you saying you will kill both of us ?
whether dying now or dying slowly after public hum@@ il@@ ation , it 's all same to me .
don 't lie to me .
do you think i will fall for that blu@@ ff ?
i don 't care if you believe it or not . i have nothing to fear any longer . choose whether we die together , or live together .
soon , the production report conference for drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be started .
please turn off your cell phones for a moment .
have a good time , ma '@@ am .
thank you .
thanks to go e@@ un , i 'm having a chance to see this kind of show .
by the way , why is she wearing black sung@@ las@@ ses in@@ doors ?
with that , can you see proper@@ ly ?
is this young wen@@ ch de@@ af ?
i guess she 's totally fine .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min stor@@ med out during the reading session .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why ... ? did he run away ?
why ?
-@@ yes .
why ?
he said he wouldn 't play for the revis@@ ed script .
you punk ... !
you should 've held even his pants to stop him !
right now , the press conference is getting ready to begin .
what about sung min ah ?
she also said she would leave , but writ@@ er lee is holding on to her .
where is the mc .... ?
now , the production report conference for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be started .
hello , everyone . i 'm your host , lee il h@@ wan .
this is driving me crazy
okay , then let me introdu@@ ce to you the two stars appe@@ aring in " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " k@@ ang hy@@ un min , sung min ah , and also director go@@ o .
let 's bring them in .
hey , what are you doing ?
quickly go and find out what 's going on .
yes
what a com@@ edy this is ... well , i guess they are having a moment to give us more dramat@@ ic effect . please wait for a moment .
well , the male lead actor , the female lead act@@ ress and director , would you please come out ?
i 'm going crazy ..@@ ... because of the script reading session which was planned before this conference , i 'm afraid the sched@@ ule has been a little bit del@@ ayed .
please wait a moment longer
they say that k@@ ang hy@@ un min might not atten@@ d this conference because of some ur@@ gent issue .
i 'm sorry
i 'm afraid i will have to leave first .
yes
we 'd better get going , too .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's not arrived yet ?
yes .
what do we do ?
what else is there to do ?
we need to go in there at least .
well , let 's go in .
going in without the protagon@@ ist ?
i 'm sorry , director . i came a bit late .
as much time as you took , you just make the food ta@@ st@@ y ..
what about the represent@@ ative ?
well , the situation in there didn 't seem good . but are you okay to be here , doing nothing ?
what brought you here ?
well , this isn 't a place i can 't come , you know .
oh , introdu@@ ce yourself to him . this is ken@@ ji , the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group .
i 'm ken@@ ji , the son of wat@@ an@@ abe hi@@ ros@@ hi .
then ... the cha@@ ir@@ man is ...
and as the new cha@@ ir@@ man of wat@@ an@@ abe group , i 'm telling you , that all invest@@ ment to world production and anthony kim will be with@@ drawn as of now .
and 3.4 bil@@ lion won previ@@ ously given for the parti@@ al invest@@ ment must be returned within this month .
episode 9 battle of red cli@@ ffs it seems the situation in there wasn 't good . but is it okay for you to be here , doing nothing ?
what brought you here ? well , this isn 't a place i can 't come , as you know . oh , introdu@@ ce yourself to him .
this is ken@@ ji , the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group . i 'm ken@@ ji , the son of wat@@ an@@ abe hi@@ ros@@ hi . then ... the cha@@ ir@@ man is ...
his ill@@ ness has gotten more serious , so he gave all management rights to me .
and as the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group , i 'm telling you ... that all invest@@ ments to world production and anthony kim ... will be with@@ drawn as of now .
and the 3.4 bil@@ lion won previ@@ ously given for the parti@@ al invest@@ ment ... must be returned within this month .
that is not possible .
if all the management rights were passed on to you , so would have the invest@@ ment contr@@ acts as well .
how can you ask for the 3.4 bil@@ lion back ?
i believe that the starting date for shooting is today on the contr@@ act .
i am making a reason@@ able request based on a bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act .
however , cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe and i had a ver@@ bal agreement on it !
a business man makes prom@@ ises by sig@@ ning and pro@@ ves with documents .
and also , anthony , let me tell you again ...
i am the cha@@ ir@@ man now .
i 'll excuse myself .
oh , yes .
didn 't i tell you before ?
that i de@@ termine your fate as well . no matter how much you wish for it ,
i 'm not going down this easily .
well , it 's not going to be easy .
i wish you good luck .
stay strong ...
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
you two , i don 't want any more tension like this after today .
such tension needs to be while you 're on camera , not out of it .
okay , let 's go in .
what going on ?
-@@ just stay still .
really ?
they are here now .
yes , everyone , you waited long enough .
the " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ac@@ tors , k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah .
this way .
well then , please give a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e .. .. for the two lead ac@@ tors and the director of ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
just now , what were they talking about ?
with@@ drawing the invest@@ ment .. ?
is it true that we have to return all the invest@@ ment money we received ?
what did they say ? say something .
represent@@ ative ...
represent@@ ative !
well then , we 'll begin the photo time for the two ac@@ tors .
i request the ac@@ tors to please use the center of the stage .
ah , really , they look so beautiful like a new@@ ly@@ wed couple .
please use the center of the stage .
i did tell you but the main lead of this drama is me .
i don 't think you 're acting s@@ kill can handle that .
that 's funny .
that 's what i should be saying .
please look at the front .
what is the reason you are res@@ cin@@ ding the finances ?
i don 't have any interest in your drama .
what i am interested in .. .. is whether you can pay me back the 3.4 bil@@ lion .
i can .
in case you can 't ... are you willing to give up your hand as a promise ? i can promise . but before that ,
i need to confir@@ m if mr. wat@@ an@@ abe also thinks the same . then give it a try .
right now , father is in korea .
he is seriously ill .
he wanted to be in korea during his final days .
he has passed away .
the cha@@ ir@@ man ... has left you a letter before passing away .
mr. anthony , i 'm sorry .
it seems that i am finally pay@@ ing for all the w@@ ron@@ gs i have commit@@ ted during my life .
i can sense that i 'll be in hell soon .
i wanted to watch your drama please forgive me who left without keeping his promise .
even if cha@@ ir@@ man wasn 't able to keep his promise
i will keep that promise .
even in hell , you will get to see ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
wat@@ an@@ abe is dead .
that 's too bad . now that the invest@@ ment is cancel@@ led for sure , there is nothing anthony can do .
it 's not over yet .
yes ?
anthony will be running around , looking for money .
we have to stop him from getting any invest@@ ments .
however , it is going to be difficult to ga@@ ther such a big amount in so little time .
is it really worth it to go to that length because of anthony ?
anthony , that bastard , is someone who wants to tear me down . until i see his last breath fa@@ de away with my own eyes , this war is not over !
when he said he couldn 't come to the show@@ case , i had no idea it was because he was ill .
who would 've ever thought he 'd pass away like that .. anyway , it 's a big hit if we have to return the invest@@ ment .
out of the 3.4 bil@@ lion , we 've used most of it and have only 100 million left . in other words , before this month is over , we have to find 3.3 bil@@ lion ?
can 't we find another invest@@ or in time ?
given this econom@@ y , it will be tou@@ gh to find a willing invest@@ or .
besides , the amount is too huge .
even if we were to take a loan , we have nothing for col@@ lateral . even if we mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously got that much money , we have to start shooting next week ....
then what are we going to do ?
are we going to end like this ?
how can we give up like that after coming all the way here .
be strong people . we never know , some kind of miracle might happen .
that 's right .
we need a miracle .
however , miracle is not something you wait for but something you make . from now on , without wast@@ ing one breath and without looking back , we 're going to run only looking ahead .
commence our meeting .
yes .
in reality , getting an invest@@ ment in a short period of time is not easy .
but we can try to get a loan from banks putting our drama as a col@@ lateral .
how much money is left in our account ?
we have about 120 million won . ( us $ 120@@ ,000 )
good , with that money , make sure the first shooting is to be prepared without any trouble .
but to return the fund on time , it would be better not to use that money ...
no , the first shooting should be succes@@ s@@ ful no matter what . rather than waiting for a slow death next to an o@@ asis which is dr@@ ying up , we should run to the end of the horizon with all our strength left .
does everyone understand ?
yes .
does everyone understand ?
yes .
good . team leader park , ar@@ range me@@ et@@ ings with our main banks .
and let 's contact other financial compan@@ ies , one by one , too .
if we can get from three compan@@ ies , the amount of each loan can be reduc@@ ed , so the possibil@@ ity ( to get the loan ) would be greater .
yes , i understand .
pd jo@@ o , manager han and he@@ e j@@ ae , you guys divide the works and prepare the shooting perfectly .
yes . well then , from now on , run to the end of the horizon as fast as we can and escape from this desert !
yes .
do you want to be in a situation later with only sending a one page script ?
what are you doing not getting on with your writing ?
yes , represent@@ ative .
i 've made a list of minor financial compan@@ ies which we might be able to get some lo@@ ans .
those are lo@@ cated within seoul or near seoul .
these three seem mostly wor@@ kab@@ le .
call them and sched@@ ule an ap@@ pointment .
jo@@ o pd , come here and look at this .
yes .
take a look at this .
it 's 14,@@ 29@@ 3,000 won .
it 's way over the budget .
please put this back .
anthony has a lot of money .
what about this ?
camera 1 will be placed over there in a long shot .
camera 2 on the boat , and camera 3 will film k@@ ang hy@@ un min jum@@ ping in the water in a full shot .
what do you think ?
yes , i think that would be good .
let 's go .
yes . your air@@ -@@ date is also fixed , and the lead actor and act@@ ress are top stars .
as long as you meet our conditions , i don 't think it would be difficult .
thank you very much .
then we will prepare all the necessary documents today and come back tomorrow .
if you could please wait for a while .
yes , head director .
yes ?
yes .
i understand .
well this ..
i don 't know how to tell you .
i 'm afraid that for this case , we won 't be able to give you the loan .
why are you saying this suddenly ?
i 'm really sorry .
this is because of our intern@@ al problem .
what is that intern@@ al problem ?
i 'm really sorry .
please don 't ask me about the reason why .
i 'm sorry , but it would be difficult .
this drama has sung min ah and k@@ ang hy@@ un min as main ac@@ tors .
its air date is also set now .
i 'm sorry .
it 's because our branch 's situation isn 't great now .
i 'm sorry , but it will be hard for us .
i 'm sorry , but it will be difficult for us .
please look over it one more time .
i am sorry .
i 'm sorry .
the hig@@ her@@ -@@ up@@ s aren 't comfortable .
please understand our situation too .
well , i think i 'm always asking you a difficult favor every time , president ( of a bank ) .
right , why don 't we go for a ro@@ unding ( golf ) some time soon ?
ah , yes .
yes , yes .
i understand .
what is the reason that you suddenly say it won 't work ?
we got it ordered from the boss , so we can 't do anything about it .
the boss ?
the boss ? i 'm really sorry .
yes , pd jo@@ o .
represent@@ ative , we have a problem .
the ship that we rent@@ ed wasn 't arri@@ ving , so i checked it up .
they are saying that they can 't send us the ship if we don 't pay twice of what we made the contr@@ act .
what ?
twice ?
yes .
if that happens , it will be way over our fund that we planned .
what should we do ?
as you know , the money is a little ...
hey crazy dog !
we at least need a ship to put the computer graphic on or whatever .
are you doing this because you don 't want to spend the money ?
i 'm really sorry director .
part of our invest@@ ment was cut off .
what ?
the invest@@ ment ?
yes , however it will be resol@@ ved soon .
please trust me .
sung min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
again .
again .
again !
still se@@ ong min ah !
does this make 's sense
she said she would write it for me !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
hey , what 's the score until now ?
37 to 38 .
se@@ ong min ah is leading by a lot .
oh my god !
jesus christ
se@@ ong min ah , that fo@@ x-@@ like woman st@@ ole away all my scenes !
hy@@ ung , with this time , you better memor@@ ize an extra line of the new script ...
what did you say , you punk ?
do you think i could concentr@@ ate on the script now ?
kw@@ ang so@@ o !
but still , why hasn 't the shooting started yet ?
i need to go and check .
why is the shooting taking so long to start ?
min ah , we have a problem .
the invest@@ ment from japan is cut off .
what is going on ?
nothing serious .
they said there was a problem with the invest@@ or .
it seems we have some problems but they will be sol@@ ved soon .
you know how anthony , despite being a dog , is good at hand@@ ling these things well , don 't get too de@@ pressed , let 's call it a day .
as you had instruc@@ ted , i made it so that the rent@@ ed ship won 't come to them , but is it really necessary to go to this length when anthony 's money has already dri@@ ed up ?
the broadcasting network needs to know that anthony has lost the invest@@ ment .
that way , his last desperate efforts will get even more gru@@ esome .
so , how are things going then ?
we 're cur@@ r@@ ently looking into new invest@@ ors so please don 't worry about it . the broadcasting license fee of 300 million per episode , we 'll pay the first episode 's in advan@@ ce .
thank you , head director .
however , this is how far i can be of help .
you have to take care of the finances as soon as possible .
if anything goes wrong , the board of direc@@ tors will have an u@@ pro@@ ar .
an u@@ pro@@ ar ?
they 'll want to sue you for fa@@ iling to fill the broadcasting s@@ lot .
[ sung min ah ]
it 's me .
min ah .
yes .
i heard that you are having some diffic@@ ulti@@ es
i 'll sol@@ ve it .
don 't worry too much .
let 's talk later .
op@@ pa .
do you remember what we talked about some time before ?
the thing we talked about during christmas at my place ?
let 's meet now .
prepare well for the shooting .
that 's how you can help me at the moment .
-@@ op@@ pa
- yes ?
later , after a long time .
once i become a famous top star , if i become someone who can help you , someone who 's strong and powerful ...
once you become one ?
when that time comes , will you accept my help ?
sure .
we 'll do that i guess .
really ?
but something like that won 't happen .
there 's a lot that you still don 't know about me .
like what type of person i am .
un@@ nie .
yes ?
what ?
contact represent@@ ative oh and tell him i have to see him .
min ah . you@@ - right now .
pd jo@@ o , get the car ready .
we 're going to m@@ ye@@ ong@@ dong .
what ?
no . you can 't , represent@@ ative .
no , i know we 're desperate , but to take a private loan ...
move .
we can 't .
the ann@@ ual interest rate is 200 % !
this is practically k@@ icking the bu@@ cket yourself !
i 'm with him .
even if our drama were to succe@@ ed .. no , even before that , we 'll all die !
i agree with them , represent@@ ative .
last time you did that , the company went ban@@ krup@@ t , you even lost your house !
the only hope we have left is cha@@ ir@@ man j@@ ang of m@@ ye@@ ong@@ dong .
represent@@ ative , i am done revis@@ ing episodes 3 and 4 ...
what 's wrong with him ? all our loan applications were rej@@ ec@@ ted , so now he 's going to get a private loan .
private loan ?
yes . then . after all you 've been through , you haven 't had enough and are still doing dram@@ as ?
it 's a drama with a set broadcasting sched@@ ule and top stars as leading ac@@ tors .
the documents inclu@@ ded are a copy of the broadcasting s@@ lot certific@@ ate and an amo@@ tiz@@ ation sched@@ ule .
even still , you 've come to me because you didn 't get any invest@@ ment .
how much ?
i need three or four big ones .
you need 3.4 bil@@ lion ?
yes .
and the col@@ lateral ?
my hand that will lead this drama to succes@@ s is the col@@ lateral .
please help .
anthony . your hand ... no , your body ,
bring me a real col@@ lateral .
cha@@ ir@@ man ... secre@@ tary choi , take him away !
cha@@ ir@@ man , i beg you !
i can even sell all my intern@@ al organ@@ s !
if i could give you all my scal@@ p , i 'd glad@@ ly skin my head .
i could serve you as a slave the rest of my life , cha@@ ir@@ man !
please , i beg you .
just this once !
cha@@ ir@@ man ! after losing everything , coming to me again and beg@@ ging like that , you 're the first . i don 't know how much this drama means to you , just give up !
cha@@ ir@@ man ...
you know what 's cru@@ eler than money ?
human amb@@ ition . if you don 't want to ru@@ in your life , start by throwing that away .
cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man , please help me !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
don 't kick me out like this ! please , cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
please help me , cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man , don 't kick me out !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
i beg you , cha@@ ir@@ man !
i don 't know how much this drama means to you , just give up !
you know what 's cru@@ eler than money ?
human amb@@ ition .
if you don 't want to ru@@ in your life . start by throwing that away .
who hasn 't turned in the school support fee yet ?
come out !
you must turn them in by tomorrow !
got it ?
yes !
good !
if you can bring the fee by tomorrow , you may go back to your seat .
what 's with you ?
you aren 't going to bring it tomorrow ?
you 'll be hit until you answer me that you 'll bring it .
you got it ?
answer !
you won 't even if i do this ?
you think you 're so tou@@ gh ?
answer me !
why are you so late ?
you 're hungry , right ?
come and eat .
i ate already .
why do we live so poor ?
why ?
did something happen at school ?
tell me , why are we so poor ?
!
something happened at school ?
i 'm not going to live like you mom .
i 'm going to ear@@ n money like crazy , and eat meat until my stomach bur@@ sts .
i 'll become a big shot that ri@@ des his own car !
i 'm going to make money even if i die !
even if i die !
i 'm im@@ pressed that you 've last@@ ed for 3 years in this sha@@ b@@ by office . that you 'd go to such leng@@ ths to make sure i 'm ru@@ ined ,
i had no idea , cha@@ ir@@ man . you didn 't even hesit@@ ate st@@ aining your own noble hands , why are you so in@@ tent on crus@@ hing me ?
that 's because i know the met@@ tle of your being more than any@@ body else .
you res@@ em@@ ble me a lot .
that 's why i speci@@ ally took a lik@@ ing to you . even so , you deser@@ ted me 3 years ago , and that wasn 't enough ? even so , you deser@@ ted me 3 years ago , and that wasn 't enough ?
what exactly is it that you want ?
leave ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' to me .
i 'll give you .@@ 5 bil@@ lion in return .
i 'll also throw in the re@@ pay@@ ment of the 3.4 bil@@ lion of wat@@ an@@ abe invest@@ ment .
how about it ?
i think that 's enough compen@@ sation for all the work you 've put into it so far .
why ?
why are you willing to go so far in order to get ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ?
you think my go@@ al is to produce just one pet@@ ty little drama like that ?
i want something much bigger .
although i guess the one who so@@ wed the se@@ ed of my big amb@@ ition doesn 't remember .
give it a good thought . whether to waste your life in ja@@ il with a huge de@@ bt crus@@ hing your shoulders , or to live an ordin@@ ary life with half a bil@@ lion won .
are you going to the cha@@ ir@@ man of empire ?
go .
go take that money .
i 'll also drop ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
isn 't it alright as long as we can start working on the next project ?
we 've made it thus far , we can try again .
it should be alright if i write another great piece .
i 'm sorry .
who is it ?
i 'm here to meet the cha@@ ir@@ man .
that 's right .
have you come to a decision ?
yes .
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ... .. i can@@ not leave it in your hands .
you should know the best that you only have one week to return the invest@@ ment .
yes , i 'm well aware of that .
however , i 'd rather die than hand over that project to you .
you 're going for a hero@@ ic suicide ?
i 'll leave it up to the gods .
who knows ?
you , cha@@ ir@@ man , could be in cao cao 's shoes , running away from the sea of red flames at the red cliff . [ romance of three king@@ dom@@ s reference ] still , in the end , it was cao cao who con@@ quer@@ ed the world .
do you think i will lose ?
what are you doing ?
don 't you know that for a writ@@ er , good health is money and time is money ?
what 's going to happen with the script if you get a cold ?
why are you outside ?
i decided to fight .
is it possible for us to win ?
what is it at this late hour ?
was it your doing , represent@@ ative ?
what ?
the can@@ cell@@ ation of the invest@@ ment of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . " min ah , i know about your feelings for anthony , but that anthony is totally ru@@ ined now .
just forget about him .
why do you hate him so much ?
i 'll tell you this at least .
this time , it was the cha@@ ir@@ man himself who did it .
what is this ?
we 've saved up some of our wag@@ es you 'd paid us so far .
we know it 's nowhere near the re@@ pay@@ ment amount , but ... writ@@ er lee made the most contribu@@ tion , by the way .
the 20 million you gave me for the script and some of my personal sav@@ ings .
it 's quite a bit . use it for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
represent@@ ative , be strong !
please be strong !
represent@@ ative .
like that would make him strong !
the director 's fee you gave me .
you can pay the interest with the next drama .
director and everybody , listen to me carefully .
do you think i 'll be grateful with this ?
please , just make sure you can look after your own selves first .
did i hear that right ?
don 't worry about it .
a person can@@ not change that easily after all .
so you 're asking me to len@@ d you money ? yes , to tell you the truth , of the 3.4 bil@@ lion of the invest@@ ment , more than half went into your pay@@ ment , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
so , if you could len@@ d the company about half ..
half ?
then , 1 bil@@ lion ?
so , are you asking me to pull out 1 bil@@ lion ?
well , it doesn 't exactly have to be 1 bil@@ lion , but whatever you could chip in ...
stop !
stop !
why should i ?
why should i part with my own blood money ? !
tell me !
our drama is at a crisis right now . we just need to over@@ come this moment of hard@@ ship , so everybody should join our efforts .
the represent@@ ative is running around looking for fun@@ ding by himself .
he may not show it , but he 's going through hell right now .
but then , why are you here to talk about this ?
yes ?
by any chance , do you like anthony ?
what ?
no , i mean , it 's anthony who 's suff@@ ering with no money .
why are you here looking for money .
isn 't that strange ?
my drama is about to be w@@ rec@@ ked , is that so strange ?
besides , if we don 't sec@@ ure enough fun@@ ds , we may never get to see " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ever !
honestly , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " started with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i 'm aware that 1 bil@@ lion is not an amount that one can easily lent .
however , you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , are like a land@@ mark of this drama .
as the protagon@@ ist of the drama , if you have any affec@@ tion towards " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... "
i beg you .
why is he like that ?
did he really start reading a book and fell asleep ?
it 's not like that .
he 's been like that for a while .
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
what do you think ?
yes ?
about len@@ ding anthony 1 bil@@ lion .
hy@@ ung , are you telling me you 've been thinking about that till now .
are you really thinking of len@@ ding the money ?
i 'm the land@@ mar@@ king of this work , so i should at@@ least think about these things .
land@@ mar@@ king ?
it 's land@@ mark .
hy@@ ung , call anthony .
tell him that i 'll help him . that 1 bil@@ lion won , i 'm deposit@@ ing it soon .
you ?
1 bil@@ lion ?
i 'm also going to try living a little differ@@ ently .
looked like they didn 't have much time , so call him now .
that i 'm sending it soon .
i 'm really calling .
hurry .
yes , represent@@ ative choi .
represent@@ ative kim ?
listen , our hy@@ un min has made a big decision for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
hy@@ un min made a big decision of what ?
since you were going through a lot of trouble because of the re@@ pay@@ ment of the invest@@ ment ... so our hy@@ un min is thinking about 1 bil@@ lion ... since he 's in lots of trouble , let him just get buried in trouble !
i can 't do this , hy@@ ung , this money means so much to me !
no , no .
i can 't .
that 's what i thought .
you would never help any@@ body with 1 bil@@ lion !
hey , dar@@ n that bastard !
hello represent@@ ative kim ? yes , represent@@ ative choi , tell hy@@ un min , that he should make a big decision about getting ready to sw@@ im in the ocean .
the call wasn 't to len@@ d money but to ask about the sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea scene ?
yes , it 's me .
i know you 're busy but come out for a while .
the same cafe where we used to go often .
i 'll wait until you get here .
who was it ?
what 's the matter ?
i 'm going to run an er@@ rand , prepare a list of potential invest@@ ors outside of the capital .
yes .
see you later .
hy@@ ung , are you crazy ?
you told me to call him !
usually , you do things at the speed of a s@@ nail .
why were you so fast this time ?
you told me to hurry !
will you die if i tell you to die ?
what ?
that was 1 bil@@ lion won of money !
are you doing whatever you want because it is not your money ?
huh ?
do you know it 's been 5 years ?
to be back here where you broke up with me so heart@@ lessly .
that was 5 years ago .
i 'm sorry but i 'm a little busy .
can we just talk about business ?
what will happen if i abandon you now ?
i 'm asking what will happen if i leave this project .
did you call me to tell me you 're done ?
no . so that i won 't leave this project , accept this money .
all i 've got that is avail@@ able right now is just half a bil@@ lion .
for interest , i would like to rece@@ ive your heart .
i guess it would still be difficult .
your dream , i hope you can make it come true . turn around world production into a world class production company like 20@@ th century fox .
world class 20@@ th century fox ... ?
that 's right .
your dream when you worked at empire 5 years ago .
here , this is the place .
we 're going to build the larg@@ est film@@ ing studio in asia .
[ 5 years ago ]
all the fans of kore@@ an dram@@ as from japan , china , other asian coun@@ tries , plus more fans from over 60 different coun@@ tries will be drawn by it .
once we can build a theme park so that it can serve as a tour@@ ist attr@@ action in ad@@ dition to a film@@ ing studio , the prof@@ its we 're cur@@ r@@ ently making from dram@@ as won 't even compar@@ e .
the catch is , we need a master@@ piece that can do it .
could you take charge and do it ?
if you 'd put me in charge , i 'm going to turn this empire into the 20@@ th century fox of dram@@ as !
i want something much bigger .
although i guess the one who so@@ wed the se@@ ed of my big amb@@ ition doesn 't remember .
so it was that .
thank you .
i 'll use the money well .
you 're a real big help .
thank you . once part of the studio is finished , let 's use it for film@@ ing " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
then , the land that was worth 5@@ k won per 35 s@@ q ft will incre@@ ase its value by 5000 % in no time !
pur@@ chase this land no matter the cost !
yes .
so , you came here because you 're interested in my land ?
i 'm interested in the whole lot of 14@@ 3@@ k s@@ q ft that you have .
for over 10 years , nobody has ever sho@@ wn interest in it .
you must have quite a fortune for someone so young .
but i won 't be bu@@ ying it .
what does that mean ?
in a few days , somebody else will come , wanting to buy your land .
he will want to speed up the deal , off@@ ering a slightly higher price than the market .
however , you should never agree to a contr@@ act .
get lost .
who do you think you 're trying to fool ?
i 've seen tons of s@@ cam@@ mers like you in my life !
i 'm sure you have seen many s@@ cam@@ mers like me .
however , you never know .
so what ? if you would believe me , you can make bil@@ lions without even lifting a finger from where you are sitting .
get lost !
i 'll wait for your call .
we can 't af@@ ford to simply wait anymore .
we need to switch to a different production company as soon as possible .
thinks very carefully .
if we don 't do well , we will be removed from our places .
i decided to fight .
is it possible for us to win ?
yes ?
it 's me .
hello .
like you said , somebody came to see me .
he offered more than the market price , wanting to buy the whole 14@@ 3@@ k s@@ q ft .
so what did you do ?
for now , i sent them back .
you did well .
so now , tell me what you want .
what i want is half of the profit you will make .
inv@@ est that money in me .
that is my condition .
( invest@@ ment ? )
will you believe me , and go along with my plan ? i 've even offered to double the market price , yet the land ow@@ ner is being stub@@ born .
he 's stub@@ born ?
yes .
he says he has no thought of s@@ elling the land .
this won 't do .
i 'll have to meet him in person .
seemed like he is great@@ ly att@@ ached to the land his father passed on to him .
it was quite a challenge to even get him to come here , with his age and all .
land passed onto him by his father , huh ?
yes .
that seems to be why he doesn 't want to sell at all .
the old live in the past and are buried in the past .
even so , the old have a future , too .
the future of the old ... ?
it 's their children .
the future of the old is the se@@ eds they have so@@ wn , their children .
like that , even as the old die away , they live the future through their se@@ eds .
i don 't understand what you 're trying to say .
there 's nothing to think so hard about .
in short , the answer is money .
the in@@ herit@@ ance of the past that can gu@@ aran@@ tee a bright future for the children .
nice to meet you .
please take a seat .
i don 't think that 's needed .
just go ahead and talk .
what is the reason that you wanted to see me ?
then , i am sure that he will get to the point right away .
i will pay the triple .
don 't accept that either . the fact that i have absolutely no thought of s@@ elling my land , i thought you were well aware of that .
well , then .
five times ...
i 'll give you five times as much .
please take a seat .
we prepared the contr@@ act .
with the condition that we will pay all the amount until noon by tomorrow .
yes ?
i just came back home after complet@@ ing the contr@@ act .
everything happened as you predic@@ ted .
i will be receiv@@ ing the money at the noon tomorrow .
yes .
i will meet you with the invest@@ ment contr@@ act tomorrow .
k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sung '@@ s@@ morning :
invest@@ ment@@ contr@@ act
what is it ?
president ken@@ ji wants to see you .
i understand .
please let him know that i will see him within today .
president ordered us to bring you .
i am on my way to get the money to return to president .
i 'm sorry but can you move aside .
say that in front of the cha@@ ir@@ man .
we only carry out his orders .
i understand .
hey , get him !
get him !
chase him !
get him !
that way !
can 't you think about it one more time ?
not just one but i thought about this 10 times .
put yourself in my sho@@ e . if you had 10 bil@@ lion , put yourself in my sho@@ e .
if you had 10 bil@@ lion , could you give it away easily ?
i 'm not asking you to give it but len@@ d it .
i 've also had a really hard time getting till here .
honestly , even if i give away 10 bil@@ lions ( $ 1 million ) , it will not be resol@@ ved .
it 's just like pum@@ ping water into a broken cro@@ ck .
how do you know if the cro@@ ck is broken or not ?
then call anthony right now and confir@@ m it .
if anthony could find a single penny , i 'll change my mind then .
hello ?
represent@@ ative ?
represent@@ ative ?
hello ?
represent@@ ative ?
lee go e@@ un , listen carefully to what i say from now on .
if you walk into an al@@ ley back of our company building , there will be an iron gate at the dead end .
what is that about ?
i don 't have time to explain in detail .
behind that gate , there is my bag .
a bag with the contr@@ act , which we need in order to get the invest@@ ment .
if you can 't contact me after@@ wards , that means something happened to me .
then you will have to find the invest@@ or with that bag .
you understand what i 'm saying right ?
yes .
but what 's wrong ?
shouldn 't we contact the police ?
no , it will be too late by then .
just do what i tell you .
before noon today , you must go and see the invest@@ or . then he will take care of the rest .
hello ?
hello !
represent@@ ative .
re@@ p ...
what is it ?
what happened ?
come with me right now .
hurry .
huh ?
hurry .
contr@@ ac@@ to@@ f@@ buy@@ ing@@ and sell@@ ing@@ land . about the land , i have sent the money .
you 've worked hard .
but do you think anthony will easily give up on the piece easily ?
it has nothing to do with anthony 's will now . once tonight is over ,
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ... .. is ours .
have you come back to your senses ?
what are you thinking of doing captur@@ ing me ?
if you let me go right now , i can bring you back the money right away .
how do i believe in those words ?
do you have an official document that you could prove it ?
if you don 't believe in me , it 's okay if you come together with me .
rather than that , easily ... getting the money back ...
i believe there is a certain way to do it .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sang ... "
leave it to the empire .
at the end , is it this ? with the same purpose as empire , are you going to thre@@ aten me so that you can give my work away to empire ?
all i need is getting my money .
that 's why please make your decision .
it 's whether by giving them " k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sung 's morning , " pay@@ ing me back , or ... give me your hand as you promised .

the promised dead@@ line is tonight at midnight .
as long as you get the money by then , isn 't it good ?
midnight ?
someone will come bring me the money by 12 ?
if only you decide to wait until then .
well , since a promise is a promise . i guess i 'll wait .
until 12 , you have around 3 hours and 10 minutes . before that , someone needs to do it for sure .
so where is this gate and this bag ?
is it even true that if we find the bag , the money can be returned ?
just sh@@ us@@ h and focus on looking !
but i 'm looking for it though .
it 's just that i don 't see it !

why ?
it 's an emergen@@ cy .
we need to see him as soon as possible .

what i 'm interested in is the present and the future .
it 's better you leave this house too .
i dont need any of that past .
what is the matter ?
i 'm here to meet mr. choi p@@ il se@@ ong .

hold on a second . please wait a little more .
let 's start .
life is so full of sur@@ prises !
who 'd have thought that i 'd hit such a jack@@ pot after so many years of dro@@ ught ?
that 's what i 'm saying .
how much did you sell that land for ?
sh@@ us@@ h ! everybody says that you now have the money saved even for your gre@@ at-@@ grand@@ children .

i 've just returned the invest@@ ment fund of 3.4 bil@@ lion won to you .
returned the invest@@ ment fund ?
mr. anthony , you 're one lucky person .
since you kept your promise , you 're free now .
yes , mr. ken@@ ji .
i was in the middle of waiting for your call .
yes ?
what is that about ?
let 's say that the promise between you and me was never made .
what are you trying to say ?
as promised , anthony re@@ pay@@ ed the invest@@ ment money .
that 's not possible .
where are you at the moment mr. ken@@ ji .
i 'll be there .
you don 't need to come here .
anthony .
yes it 's me , anthony .
what kind of trick did you use ?
you shouldn 't speak like that to someone you helped .
what ?
!
i was able to resol@@ ve this thanks to you who pur@@ chas@@ ed choi p@@ il se@@ ong 's us@@ eless land for 5 times more money than it 's worth .
thank you very much .
i 'll make sure the money is used without waste .
anthony !
as you wanted , you became cao cao .
unfortunately , you fell off from the red cliff to the sea of fire , though . whatever it is , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
anthony !
like this , our problem is over .
we won 't need to see each other again .
anthony !
how dare you take my money ! and mo@@ ck me ?
shit !
thank you very much for keeping your promise .
what have i done here ?
bank@@ ers had to do all the work at this late hour .
from now on our dram@@ a- what was it again ?
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
oh right , ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . ' i 'm leaving it to you .
don 't worry about it since korea 's best top stars are in it .
that 's right !
i 'll also be expecting from the top star .
yes , of course .
how was i ?
wasn 't i quite use@@ ful ?
you 're very use@@ ful for your s@@ kill to torture me by making me wait .
yes ?
you 've tor@@ tured me until the very end , but now are you saying you were use@@ ful ?
ah , the old saying is never wrong .
" you saved a dro@@ wning person , but then that person demand@@ s you to bring his bun@@ dle too . "
if you 're going to save a dro@@ wning person , of course , you should save his bun@@ dle too !
i guess you 're fine since you 're all pom@@ p@@ ous like before .
see you tomorrow .
i think i should also say my last far@@ e@@ well .
ms. ak@@ iko , what are you going to do from now on ?
i 'll return back to japan and live like a new person . even though the cha@@ ir@@ man has left , please make a really good drama .
i will also watch it .
why did you hang up without talking about me ?
well , while i was talking to him ... the car taken was mine , the one driving is me and the bag was found because of me .
how big my contribu@@ tion was !
you can 't just ignore it !
oh come on , i 'll tell him about it later .
you definitely have to put in the word how big my help was .
if i say it to him myself , it doesn 't look good .
so writ@@ er lee , you should make sure to mention it to him , got it ?
yes .
we 're almost there .
please turn right here .
turn right .
you 've tor@@ tured me until the very end , but now are you saying you were use@@ ful ?
if you 're going to save a dro@@ wning person , of course you should save his bun@@ dle too !
what were you thinking about that you are gigg@@ ling like that ?
so , you came back alive without being hurt .
thanks to someone .
thanks to someone who was so slow , i was sh@@ it-@@ scared , indeed .
you must have been really scared . ( in in@@ formal spe@@ ach )
don 't talk to me without honor@@ ific@@ s .
i was talking to myself right now .
do i have to use pol@@ ite form even when i 'm talking to myself ?
but ... why did you come ?
thank you .
i came here to say that .
represent@@ ative
if you 're that grateful , do you want to get some beer ?
i don 't like that .
ready ?
action !
how is it ?
how do you feel after watching the film@@ ing of the drama you invest@@ ed in ? the cru@@ ise scene you guys film@@ ed in the morning was spectac@@ ular too , but the passion of that handsome actor . wow !
this is aw@@ esome !
wow !
cut !
towel !
director !
let 's go one more time hy@@ un min .
this is already the 4@@ th time .
can 't you separ@@ ately film me walking out of the water ?
this scene 's key point is the main role kim wo@@ o jin who has went through all diffic@@ ulti@@ es and survi@@ ved from the rough sea !
if we use cu@@ ts , it won 't have the same effect
let 's go for more re@@ alist@@ ic in one shot .
one more for the last time okay ?
that 's right .
you can do it since you 're the best actor .
alright !
let 's go one more time .
from the point kim wo@@ o jin sw@@ im@@ s !
cut !
you can 't be shaking like that !
again !
cut !
what 's with that dog !
you son of a b * t@@ ch !
hey , aren 't you going to control this mut@@ t ?
because of the dog@@ -
cut !
again !
director .
cut !
okay !
it 's a wrap !
hy@@ un min !
you were aw@@ esome !
let 's all give a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e for k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
you@@ wer@@ eg@@ re@@ at !
good@@ work !
are you alright hy@@ ung ?
to the car , to the car , hurry .
put on the he@@ ater .
he@@ ater !
he@@ ater !
just watching this is making me cold .
he should experience more hard@@ ships .
even with that , he won 't be able to become a real actor , though .
i guess so ...
represent@@ ative !
the cha@@ ir@@ man is coming this way .
what ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man ?
yes .
he 's on his way with a team of empire 's law@@ yers .
legal team ... ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man is here .
you 're here . from now on , while anthony had been working as the c.@@ e.@@ o. of empire production for 7 years , the lo@@ bb@@ ying fund , der@@ el@@ ic@@ tion of duty or em@@ baz@@ z@@ lement he commit@@ ted , no matter what it is , find anything so that we can prepare to crus@@ h him !
yes ? find any documents about anthony , even if it 's a penny or a single rece@@ ip@@ t , and hand them over to our legal team ! but , considering anthony 's person@@ ality ,
there isn 't ?
if there is@@ nt , then isn 't it your job to make one ?
he 's the bastard who made me throw away my money , 8 bil@@ lion won in the air .
listen well everybody . if you want to keep eating and living with my money , find it no matter what !
no matter what !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
did you really turn up the he@@ ater to the high@@ est ?
yes , hy@@ ung .
are you okay ?
do i look okay ?
hurry up and shut the door . the cold wind is blo@@ wing in .
this is warm coffee .
this will make you feel a little war@@ mer .
that 's why i told you to cut out this scene from the script .
but after coming here and seeing the shoot , i think keeping it was the right decision . i 'm in this state now , but how can you say that ?
you looked so aw@@ esome today , aw@@ esome enough to make all the staff out there fall for you .
was i that cool ?
of course , you were the best !
like brad pit@@ t ?
yes . like brad pit@@ t .
in@@ evit@@ able , huh ?
like brad pit@@ t ?
it 's cold .
it 's been a long time ... since the two of us came to the beach like this .
true .
but ... why did you want to see me ?
to return this .
i 'm than@@ k@@ ful but everything is sol@@ ved .
just keep it .
you know it well , don 't you ?
that we can never know what might happen anywhere , any how .
something like that won 't happen but if it does , i 'll take it . so keep it .
how does it feel having your 3-@@ year old work experien@@ cing its first shoot ?
i don 't feel anything .
just feel like going back to my regular rout@@ ine ?
why ?
other people may not notice , but you can 't fool my eyes .
represent@@ ative , you are extre@@ mely excited with anticip@@ ation right now .
me ?
represent@@ ative , you might be the person with the smal@@ l@@ est understanding of ones@@ elf in the world .
because it has become your ha@@ bit to hide your feelings and forget about yourself .
you 're talking as if you know a lot about me .
is there anything more i need to know ? i 'm sorry but er@@ ase all the memories you 've had with me .
since i 've already er@@ ased mine a long time ago .
i 'm telling you again as the director of the drama department of s@@ bc . all actions you 're making now , please stop them immediately .
so , does that mean that you 're suppor@@ ting anthony more , not me ?
no .
it 's because " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is also my drama .
yes ?
director , the film@@ ing crew finished today 's shooting and they are about to leave for seoul now .
by the way , i was wondering if you are going to atten@@ d tonight 's team dinner .
of course , i should go to that .
yes . i understand .
- what are you doing ?
- oh my god , oh my god ! you scared me to death !
being scared is your concern , but i asked what you were doing . when i 'm feeling really good or when i 'm feeling down , i 'm usually doing this by myself .
if you do this , it makes you feel much fres@@ her .
by closing your eyes like this and rais@@ ing your arms up like wings and start imagin@@ ing .
i 'm free and flying in the sky . underneath me
i see my work place and i also see my mother 's mac@@ ker@@ el restaurant .
just like this after taking a long tour you come down and open your eyes .
it 's the we@@ ir@@ dest stret@@ ch i 've ever seen in my life .
stop doing us@@ eless things and hurry up to leave .
since everyone is waiting because of you .
everyone , attention , please !
today , the head director of the s@@ bc drama department will say something .
hello everyone . the director should have done it .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " finally started its first step . of course , there were many complic@@ ations , but the director , ac@@ tors and all staf@@ fs endu@@ red them all together , so i believe this start was possible . well , a good res@@ ult is too obvious , but during that long journey for the next 4 months ,
i wish no one gets sick and everything goes well . should we make a to@@ ast ?
everyone , raise your glass , please .
if i say , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... "
what do you say mr. hy@@ un min ?
let 's go with da@@ eb@@ ak .
da@@ eb@@ ak is good .
alright then , ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' is da@@ eb@@ ak .
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' !
da@@ eb@@ ak !
here , here .
definitely , kore@@ an be@@ ef is different .
these days , kore@@ an far@@ ms are having a lot of diffic@@ ulti@@ es , so we should eat kore@@ an be@@ ef a lot .
what 's up with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , tre@@ ating all the staff with kore@@ an be@@ ef ?
well , that cost@@ s nothing .
you 're really a lot different .
and , i 'm the pr amb@@ ass@@ ador of kore@@ an be@@ ef , so i know well about this kind of thing .
this place 's meat is the best !
be@@ ef will be served as much as you want , so order as much as you want !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min seems to be a better person than what i thought before .
he even knows how to buy for the staff . this isn 't paid for with his own money . it 's a sponsor@@ ship .
what ?
even meat can be spon@@ so@@ red ?
wasn 't he tre@@ ating us because he is the pr amb@@ ass@@ ador of kore@@ an be@@ ef ?
that 's why he gets that sponsor@@ ship .
alright everyone .
our actor , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , is tre@@ ating you huge with this clothing for staff !
well , everyone , take one !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
min ah , you should have one too .
i prepared one for you !
by any chance , these are also ... ?
spon@@ so@@ red . after all , he 's the greatest st@@ ing@@ y actor who never sp@@ ends his own money , even a penny .
wow ! how is it ?
is your il@@ lusion about him now breaking ?
yes , you can speak now .
who did you say you were ?
you 're pretty sh@@ amel@@ ess .
looking at you having so much fun after your the@@ ft .
i don 't know what you mean , but i think you should first say who you are .
i 'm jo young e@@ un , the writ@@ er of nov@@ el " lo@@ vers of destiny . "
so what ?
your drama copi@@ ed my nov@@ el .
i don 't think you don 't know about that .
i don 't know about that , but i know one thing very well .
every time when i make a drama , i get a phone call from people like you .
and whenever that happens , i say like this .
then go ahead .
stop your funny trick and get lost .
unless you want to lose your money for law@@ yer 's fee while trying to get a few penn@@ ies by black@@ ma@@ iling .
represent@@ ative . what are you doing here ?
let 's go in , everyone is waiting .
alright .
hurry .
alright , i 'm going .
well then everyone , was the meat del@@ icious ?
yes !
please go in .
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative ! represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !
everyone !
now is the moment everyone has been waiting for .
we 'll now listen to a song from world production 's represent@@ ative .
i can 't do it so ask someone else .
but still , at@@ least one song .
that 's right represent@@ ative . at@@ least one song .
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative ! represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !
whose theme is it ? [ a famous kore@@ an classic song " ke@@ um@@ k@@ ang mountain we 've missed " ]
a clear and pretty mountain !
12,000 moun@@ tain@@ to@@ ps we 've missed so much .
although they don 't say a word .
finally ...
i 'll stop till here .
what was that ?
is he upset because we laughed ?
i will change the mood .
new writ@@ er lee go e@@ un will be sing@@ ing .
pd jo@@ o ?
must we use chop@@ st@@ icks well to eat food ?
[ " dance with dj d.@@ o.@@ c " by dj d.@@ o.@@ c. ]
even if we don 't use chop@@ st@@ icks well , we can eat food well !
but when i eat food , people around me always say , " do you have any problem with this table ? "
that was su@@ pris@@ ing .
what was ?
the represent@@ ative that i know wouldn 't be sing@@ ing in front of people .
i guess i was wrong .
i thought i knew a lot about you .
it seems you 've changed .
everyone changes .
is that change because of lee go e@@ un ?
i 'm sorry but you got it completely wrong .
i 'm not someone who changes because of anyone .
even for my change , i choose to change myself .
ow , my head .
miss lee go e@@ un .
yes ?
who is it ?
ms. lee go e@@ un , here is the regi@@ ster@@ ed mail .
you 're miss lee go e@@ un , right ?
yes .
sign over here .
yes .
thank you .
ow , my head .
what is it ?
regar@@ ding to bann@@ ing air@@ ing the drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " for plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ing the nov@@ el " lo@@ vers of destiny " ?
what is this ?
yes .
this is writ@@ er jo young e@@ un .
i 'm sorry but i think i told you that i have no interest in your mere nov@@ el .
then , from now on , i think you should dev@@ el@@ op some interest in my nov@@ el .
because i 've also sent the certific@@ ation of cont@@ ents to writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
and you keep saying that i 'm black@@ ma@@ iling you with a silly reason ... no , let me tell you first why that is a silly black@@ mail .
what jud@@ ges and pro@@ secu@@ tors hate the most is this kind of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism case .
all you 've got to do is just sh@@ amel@@ ess@@ ly throw your book at them for review , hoping that that will bo@@ ost the sale of your book and they are stuck with reading the whole pa@@ the@@ tic writing , and even if they do finish reading it , 99.@@ 9 % of the time it ends up being a waste of time .
i don 't think you understand what i 'm saying .
i don 't know how you got your hands on the script of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " when it hasn 't even ai@@ red yet , but we don 't know about your book nor do we need to know about it .
what are you doing ?
this is my problem .
this is ' morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's ' writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
so you are lee go e@@ un ?
let 's meet .
you don 't have to meet .
yes .
yes , i 'll see you there then .
she 's just trying to st@@ ir up contro@@ vers@@ y to sell more copi@@ es of her book .
we 'll only find that out after meeting right ?
i 'll be the one meeting her and taking care of this !
stop wast@@ ing time and just focus on writing your script .
no , this is a problem of me and my pride as a writ@@ er .
i 'll sol@@ ve it myself .
you 're younger than i had thought ... and so ras@@ h .
i don 't think i deserve to hear such words .
look here , ms. lee go e@@ un .
reg@@ ard@@ less of how much you want to get fame and succes@@ s , you shouldn 't ste@@ al someone else 's work and present it as if it is yours .
can you still call yourself a writ@@ er ? ste@@ aling ? i don 't know why you would accuse me like this , but
i haven 't stol@@ en anything . my book ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers ' was publ@@ ished 5 years ago .
'@@ morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' started 6 years ago .
besides , the main stor@@ y@@ line was finished a year before that , in 2005 .
do you have any evidence ?
your work wasn 't even regi@@ ster@@ ed for co@@ py@@ right .
don 't think you can get away with this by lying .
you 're the one being pre@@ poster@@ ous here .
i 'm the one who 's the vic@@ tim here .
vic@@ tim ?
admit to it when i 'm putting it nic@@ ely .
admit that you plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed my work .
no , i will never agree to it since it 's not the truth .
ms. lee go ge@@ un , i 'll make sure that your drama never air@@ s .
i 'll ap@@ ply for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast .
go deal with it . let me tell you one more time ,
i 'm not a writ@@ er that ste@@ als someone else 's work to make a name for myself .
have you read my book ?
you 'll know once you read my book .
excuse me .
i 'm looking for a nov@@ el .
what 's the title ?
f@@ ated lo@@ vers .
[ questions of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism on morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , a drama before air@@ ing has plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed ? ]
[ writ@@ er jo young e@@ un of ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers ' wants to reve@@ al the truth ! ]
w@@ hoa , even ap@@ pl@@ ying for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing our drama broad@@ cast ?
who 's calling the ket@@ tle black ?
i know !
our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un would never plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ize someone else 's work !
she wouldn 't even know that plag@@ i@@ ar@@ izm is sp@@ el@@ led with a p !
how pres@@ um@@ p@@ tu@@ ous of them !
this cho ye@@ ong e@@ un seems like a weird writ@@ er . at any rate , more and more news articles are coming out , and if she 's already started ap@@ pl@@ ying for an in@@ jun@@ ction , this is getting real serious ...
- stop wor@@ rying about it .
what they want is exactly this type of attention from the ignor@@ ant mas@@ ses .
so don 't concern yourself with this and do your work .
i 'll take care of it .
yes !
pd jo@@ o , come see me for while .
yes ! by the way , what exactly is that in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast ? well , when there is a contro@@ vers@@ y of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , they can make a legal request to the court to stop the drama from being ai@@ red .
then , what if it gets accepted ?
then , the drama won 't get ai@@ red at all .
the drama won 't get ai@@ red ?
but that won 't happen to us , so don 't worry .
go make some coffee now .
yeah , no need to worry . get a copy of " f@@ ated lo@@ vers " and give it to law@@ yer park , and also send him a copy of the drama pro@@ pos@@ al and scrip@@ ts for review .
but .. there 's no way that writ@@ er lee would have plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed .
is it really necessary to do all that ?
we have to be ready to face them , not sit around doing nothing .
i see .
but ...
don 't you think it might be the empire 's doing ?
it 's not the empire .
this is too small of an issue for it to be an attack from them .
[ application for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong in progress ]
is this your doing ?
no cha@@ ir@@ man .
of course not , it had better not be you !
if you thought of sto@@ op@@ ing down to such pet@@ ty tr@@ icks like this and st@@ ain my reputation , you 'd be dead , too !
it 's definitely not me cha@@ ir@@ man .
please believe me .
then , fine !
just focus on what i told you to do !
no matter what , we 've got to find some evidence that can put that bastard anthony in ja@@ il !
that 's your top prior@@ ity !
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
alright , let 's start .
as you may already know by now , there is a plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y about " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
has anyone read the ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers ' ?
i took a look at it , and it seems that it 's not something that can be over@@ looked .
however , given that they 're both set in the japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation period , some simil@@ ar@@ ities are in@@ evit@@ able .
some parts in the book are indeed similar , i must admit . especially the character of the female protagon@@ ist is the same , so that can be a problem for us .
the problem is what the court will decide . plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism cas@@ es are gener@@ ally ambigu@@ ous , but if the judge deci@@ des that it really is plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , then the drama will be bann@@ ed from broadcasting .
if it comes to that , things will get really serious .
we have to prepare some kind of a counter@@ plan .
who knows if writ@@ er lee go e@@ un really did plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ize her work ?
alright , i understand .
let me first discus@@ s this matter with writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
who is it ?
who is it ?
writ@@ er lee , it 's me . director nam , i surprised you by coming here without calling you right ?
but this way , i can check on you and make sure that you 're working on your script .
can i get a cup of tea ?
yes , sure . come in .
yes .
wow , you 've done quite a bit of background research .
yes .
[ f@@ ated lo@@ vers ]
but still if you had called , i would have prepared something .
no , no need for that .
you must be the bus@@ i@@ est person right now .
a cup of tea is just fine .
i 'll drink it well .
ah@@ h , this is pep@@ per@@ min@@ t flav@@ or .
yes .
are you doing well ?
yes .
i know what you want to tell me .
you 're here because of the plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism issue right ?
is it written on my face ?
it 's not me .
i really didn 't ste@@ al it .
that 's right .
you know , as one gets older , his need@@ less wor@@ ries grow bigger , too .
yes .
writ@@ er lee , you should just concentr@@ ate on writing your script , and i 'll discus@@ s this matter with represent@@ ative kim .
what do you think at@@ tor@@ ney park ? before we get to that , this writ@@ er called lee go e@@ un is she someone trust@@ wor@@ thy ?
why do you ask ?
i think this is going to be a tou@@ gh case . the other party has hi@@ red someone with a good track record with plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism cas@@ es like this , law@@ yer j@@ ang hy@@ un j@@ ae .
at@@ tor@@ ney j@@ ang ?
yes .
the re@@ tain@@ er must be quite hef@@ ty .
this writ@@ er of " f@@ ated lo@@ vers "
has put her fate on the line with this law@@ suit . unless you can provi@@ de some kind of a firm evidence , the in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast may be gr@@ ant@@ ed .
[ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , a drama before air@@ ing in a plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y ? ] as you had asked ,
i 've brought all the ac@@ coun@@ ting records of production bud@@ gets of the dram@@ as that anthony had produc@@ ed while he was working in empire .
okay .
good work .
oh , right . about that plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , "
you didn 't have a hand in it , did you , director heo ?
i did meet with the writ@@ er and introduc@@ ed law@@ yer choi and media repor@@ ters to her .
law@@ yer choi is pretty good in that area . director heo , is this the time to work on something so pet@@ ty ?
were you thinking of tar@@ n@@ ishing my reputation with such a pa@@ the@@ tic trick ?
!
i 'm sorry .
shall i stop them , then ?
no .
just leave it . however ,
i didn 't hear about this .
understand ?
yes .
if you understand , then leave . if the reason for calling me is about the plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism issue with ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , ' then don 't worry about it since i 'm taking care of it .
you know , sometimes , i en@@ vy your attitude of always making such bold stat@@ ements in full confidence .
let me ask you one thing .
this time , does that firm confidence of yours come from your trust in writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ? there is only one thing i believe in , that ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's ' first broad@@ cast will be ai@@ red on november 5@@ th .
it 's only that .
i know there should be a back@@ -up cd with a saved copy somewhere ... ah , em@@ ail .
i 'd sent it to writ@@ er jung before .
em@@ ail ...
[ questions of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism on morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong .
simil@@ ar@@ ities to a 5-@@ year old nov@@ el . ]
[ application for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the broad@@ cast of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " in progress ] writ@@ er jo young e@@ un of " f@@ ated lo@@ vers " wants to reve@@ al the truth !
[ the only experience she had was as an assistant writ@@ er .
i suppose she plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed because she had no talent . ]
[ i was gon@@ na watch it because of min ah , but i guess not . if she can 't write , she shouldn 't be called a writ@@ er . ]
[ ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er ?
plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ er ?
] [ she shouldn 't have done it if she 's got no talent . ]
this is completely a pi@@ g 's st@@ y !
mom !
no matter how busy you are , you should at@@ least clean up !
what is this mess ? that 's right .
what br@@ ings you here ?
what br@@ ings me here ...
i brought some side dis@@ hes for you .
just take a taxi .
got money to burn ?
don 't worry about me
just make sure not to ski@@ p your me@@ als no matter how busy you are .
go e@@ un ah ...
keep this is mind
you ... are park k@@ ang ja 's daughter despite what anyone says .
i raised you without much money and without a father , but i still put in a lot of love and care into you !
that 's why you need to make sure that you take good care of yourself and stay heal@@ thy while you work .
got it ?
yeah , mom .
oh my , the bus is here .
mom is going .
eat well and work .
alright , alright !
[ director go@@ o ]
yes , director . writ@@ er lee , is the writing going well ? is the writing going well ?
yes , of course .
don 't pay any attention to that plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism th@@ ing@@ y .
it happens quite frequ@@ ently in this field .
yes .
but ... you might have to come here for a while .
you might have to come here for a while .
min ah is asking to rev@@ ise the script .
it 's the scenes that we 're shooting today .
we 're shooting in the studio right now .
if you could come , i 'd really appreciate it .
yes , i understand .
excuse me , director .
can we get something to eat since i 'm really hungry .
aig@@ oo . we can@@ not have our actor hungry .
alright then , we 'll take a 30 minute break .
ms. sung min ah .
jud@@ ging from the under@@ lines on your script , i guess you 're trying to cr@@ am your lines at the last minute ?
while i 'm eating , make sure you finish memor@@ iz@@ ing them .
if you have time to eat , why don 't you analy@@ ze your character more in dep@@ th ?
if you don 't want me the ste@@ al the scene .
sure , so you 're going to challenge me ? when the right opportunity comes , i 'll crus@@ h you down for sure !
the little things that anno@@ y me !
hy@@ ung , this is bad .
what is ?
- about writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
because of the plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y , there 's a lot of internet hate spe@@ ech .
is it bad ?
yes .
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
i don 't know about others but lee go e@@ un would never do something like that .
if it was plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed , it was the other writ@@ er that did it !
it must be right ? if i think about it , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is right .
new noir with no melo@@ drama . if we were to do something like that book , " f@@ ated lo@@ vers , " i would have had to hold , hug , and even kiss that bi * * * of sung min ah !
i think hy@@ un min is seriously commit@@ ted this time .
he 's still got a long way to go , though .
if he 's going to match sung min ah 's acting .
so now we 've just got two sol@@ it@@ ary scenes of min ah , right ?
is the shooting going well ?
what br@@ ings you here ?
i 've got to make sure that you 're not out of practice , director go@@ o .
is that so ?
sure , watch me carefully and judge for yourself if i 'm out of practice or not .
i guess it 's break time ?
yeah , while we 're shooting , min ah said she had something to talk with writ@@ er lee .
writ@@ er lee ?
she wants some of her lines changed .
i heard that writ@@ er lee just got here .
it may take some time for you to wit@@ ness my no@@ t-@@ so-@@ ou@@ t-@@ of-@@ practice skil@@ ls in direc@@ ting .
we can wait .
you 're here .
yes .
i heard that you wanted me to ad@@ just a few lines .
please have a sit .
ah , yes .
what 's the matter with all these lines ?
what are you talking about ?
director , it seems they forgot to turn off the mike .
no leave it .
let 's hear what they 're talking about .
we have nothing special to do anyway .
never mind . episode 1 , scene 43 , the four@@ th ... g@@ wang so@@ o , isn 't that the voice of sung min ah and writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
hy@@ ung , i guess the micro@@ phone isn 't turned off .
it 's not only that .
you 're asking me to change this now ?
yes .
the lines that are under@@ lined all need to be changed so that we can start shooting right away .
there 's no way i can act with those lines .
seriously sung min ah , don 't you think you 're over doing it ?
even though i 'm a new writ@@ er ...
it 's not that . unless you want to be bran@@ ded as a plag@@ ir@@ iz@@ er for the rest of your career , change them .
what is it that you want to say right now ?
you should know it very well .
i 'm sure you 've read the book ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers . '
looking at your expression , i guess you did read it .
how was it ? the character of the female protagon@@ ist , similar lines , is it just me who 's seeing the simil@@ ar@@ ities ?
tell me , is it just me who 's seeing it ?
i saw it too .
i acknow@@ ledge the fact that there are simil@@ ar@@ ities .
turn off the mic . i didn 't see it before , but were you such a sh@@ amel@@ ess person from the beginning ? even though the two works are similar ,
i didn 't ste@@ al it . ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' is something i wrote with my own strength .
how should i believe that ?
it 's true ! there are similar lines because the sett@@ ings are similar , and that 's because it 's set in the japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation period ...
do you think that 's a vali@@ d excuse ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
didn 't you admit it .
i heard it all because the mic was on .
writ@@ er lee
i 'm really disap@@ pointed . whatever the case , start changing these .
with these lines , as long as my name is involved , i can 't act .
you have to .
what ... did you just say ?
i 'm telling you to follow this script without trying to change it .
represent@@ ative kim .
no matter what , we have to get the drama ai@@ red on the sched@@ ul@@ ed date .
plus i have one request .
don 't call out the writ@@ er and dem@@ and for any change in the script from now on .
what are you doing not working on your script ?
getting the drama ai@@ red is important , but my inno@@ cen@@ ce is important to me , too .
in order to take care of the in@@ jun@@ ction on bann@@ ing the broad@@ cast , yes , both are important .
at the end , even you don 't believe me .
yes , i do . i may not believe any@@ body in this world ,
i may not even believe in myself sometimes , but that me belie@@ ves in you .
next week on king of dram@@ as . everybody , i am the represent@@ ative of the production company , anthony kim .
this " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " that we are all working on should not become a drama of distr@@ ust .
the truth that " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is wh@@ ol@@ ly created by our writ@@ er and that it is our righ@@ t@@ ful drama , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un and i vou@@ ch for it .
nay , we have to believe it .
and we will prove that truth .
mean@@ while , we need to continue shooting " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ! "
episode 11 line of life and i may not trust anyone in the world , and sometimes i don 't trust even myself , but i , such a person like that ... trust you . but this matter will not be resol@@ ved with that .
if even you felt these two pieces similar , you must prove that you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " earlier ( than that nov@@ el ) . pro@@ ving that you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " by yourself should be the top prior@@ ity . with that , get acknow@@ led@@ ged about your sin@@ cer@@ ity by other people too .
director , it 's me . ah , yes . please turn on the micro@@ phone again .
micro@@ phone ?
turn on the micro@@ phone .
everyone , i 'm anthony kim , the represent@@ ative of the production company .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " which you guys are making now must not become a piece of distr@@ ust .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is sol@@ ely the creation made by our writ@@ er and us .
not only writ@@ er lee go e@@ un but i gu@@ aran@@ tee that fact .
no , we must believe that !
and i will prove that truth .
instead , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ song " must keep being film@@ ed .
that 's all i want to say .
there@@ fore , please act without any doubt . even so , if you still can 't trust this script , then trust me and act for that role .
to air our drama without any problem , we need some solid proof to show you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " first .
and we should sub@@ mit that proof to the court by the day after tomorrow , wed@@ nes@@ day .
that nov@@ el@@ ist said she wrote her first draft in 2006 , right ?
yes .
then , we just need to find the file which you wrote earlier than 2006 . i know that , but ...
but ? it was a long time ago , so although i looked for it everywhere , i couldn 't find it .
then , what about e-@@ mail ?
i had , but again , since it was a long time ago , every record back then had been er@@ ased . i 've also contac@@ ted some people in that site , but he said it can 't be re@@ sto@@ red .
then , what about another computer ?
have you ever worked with another computer , not your current lap@@ top ?
other than my lap@@ top ?
yes , other than your lap@@ top .
teacher je@@ ong ? ( writ@@ er je@@ ong ) in the lap@@ top of writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o 's studio , which i 'd used when i was her assistant , there might be my file left .
hello , this is writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o .
what should we do ?
it seems she 's now ab@@ road .
where is her studio now ?
what on earth are you going to do later after this ?
what do you mean ?
i 'm doing this to go in .
writ@@ er je@@ ong will understand us too . uh , by the way , you two , are you really the o@@ wn@@ ers of this house ?
yes !
of course !
this isn 't the first time my wife has done something like this .
i 'm a bit ... car@@ eless .
we have a big age gap , but how could you say i 'm your " wife " ?
honey ..
you should inst@@ all a new door@@ lock now .
you know that , right ?
of course .
that 's right .
what are doing not looking for it ?
yes .
i found it !
no , i trust you .
i may not trust anyone in the world , and may not even trust myself ,
but i .. trust you .
see i told you ! / i
doesn 't it feel better coming out ?
i just came with you since you looked so nervous for your debut .
let 's leave after a while .
i 'm not nervous at all .
you don 't believe me ?
i don 't believe in anyone .
sometimes , i don 't trust myself either .
but there 's one thing i have the ultimate trust in .
and that is how you will be the nation 's , no the world 's top star .
don 't tell me you use those words to se@@ du@@ ce women ?
now you seem more like a woman .
later , act with your feeling now .
it will be hel@@ p@@ ful .
it 's not here .
the file i last saved was in 2011 .
i guess everything was er@@ ased and new@@ ly saved again .
we don 't need to wait and see any longer . well , in front of the ac@@ tors and staff , the writ@@ er came forward and admitted that .
even if it 's a bit late , we should prepare the re@@ placement now .
but is it really true that writ@@ er lee admitted that herself ? since sung min ah pushed and asked her , she said that it 's true that those two pieces are similar .
that 's what i heard .
they seemed similar to each other even when i read them . i will sub@@ mit these materi@@ als to the court as evidence , but with only these ,
i can 't gu@@ aran@@ tee the res@@ ult .
in the worst case scenario , the in@@ jun@@ ction to prohi@@ bit the air@@ ing of the drama , will be appro@@ ved .
when is the sub@@ mission of evidence due ?
it 's by midnight today .
pd jo@@ o .
yes , represent@@ ative .
contact that nov@@ el@@ ist .
tell her i want to meet her before that due time .
par@@ don ?
what are you going to do when you meet her ?
she won 't accept any deal for sett@@ lement .
even if i have to kne@@ el down or beg her , i should do whatever i can .
even if we have to put her name as the writ@@ er of the original story , the drama must be ai@@ red .
for now , law@@ yer park , go to the court and sub@@ mit these materi@@ als . pd jo@@ o , find out where writ@@ er jo young e@@ un is right now .
yes .
then , let 's get going .
is something wrong ?
why ?
do you have writ@@ er 's block ?
you must be nervous because the first broad@@ cast day is coming up .
yeah , it must be .
aig@@ oo .. aig@@ oo , why are you crying like a fool ? at your element@@ ary school liter@@ ary con@@ test , you said that it was embarras@@ sing when i was crying .
did i say that ?
that 's right . the award certific@@ ate you won that day , the hand@@ -@@ cr@@ af@@ ted paper father 's day car@@ nation , and the di@@ ary you wrote in saying you 'd become a great writ@@ er .. i still have all those things .
why have you kept them still ?
do you think that 's all ?
while you were in high school , you wrote me a letter saying you were going to leave the house .. after fin@@ ishing ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' , you even gave me that plastic thing telling me you 'd show me the first .
i still have that too .
when you say ' plastic thing ' .. was it like this small ?
sure is !
mom , where is it ?
why ?
i found it !
what is it ?
morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong - 03.@@ 14.@@ 2005 .
lee go e@@ un first draft
is that something important ?
this is great !
i found it !
i 'm saved !
thank god .
how much is that ?
it 's pr@@ ic@@ eless !
i 'm saved !
i love you !
that 's such a relief .
i got a hold of writ@@ er jo young e@@ un .
she says she 'll wait for you at a cafe near her house in he@@ uk@@ su@@ k@@ dong .
alright .
what do you want ?
i found it !
i said , " i found it ! "
i found the first draft of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " i wrote back in 2005 !
oh , taxi !
then , we 're good .
pro@@ ps team , get them ready !
bring those chairs this way !
still no contact from anthony ?
yes .
excuse me .
a decision will be made by court today ..
do you want to try calling ?
alright , let 's start film@@ ing !
tell me .
what is your reason ?
ok , cut !
shoot me if you can .
crazy bastard
i said , tell me !
hold on .
stop film@@ ing .
yeah . it 's me , represent@@ ative kim .
the court has made a decision .
and the res@@ ult ?
what .. ?
i understand .
i 'll pass the message .
everyone .
the res@@ ult per@@ tain@@ ing to the broad@@ cast of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has arrived .
it has been determined that ..
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is not a plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed script .
it 's an original piece of work !
without an oun@@ ce of susp@@ icion , let 's do our best for the first broad@@ cast !
understood , everyone ?
!
yes !
such a cry@@ baby .
oh ..
thank you , represent@@ ative .
don 't be dis@@ organiz@@ ed in the future .
get your stuff co@@ py@@ righ@@ ted , take good care of all your files , and save back@@ -@@ up@@ s .
crying and laughing , way to make a scene .
throw it away .
but it looks expen@@ sive .
let 's go together !
aig@@ oo , seriously ! i 'm in a skirt !
stop acting like you 're so clean .
i 'm not .
you 're just dirty .
what is this ?
a.@@ k ?
can 't you tell by looking ?
it 's my name .
ah ..
was your name anthony from the very beginning ?
i mean , even though your parents lived in the united states for so long . they 're still kore@@ an , so wouldn 't they give you a kore@@ an name ?
no such thing .
my name was anthony from the day i was born .
how can there be anthony in a kore@@ an name ?
what do your parents think ?
i never asked them .
then call them and ask them .
they both passed a long time ago .
you don 't need to feel sorry since i 'm not concerned in any way .
then should i give you a kore@@ an name ?
what would be good ?
kim ..
kim ..
ah !
how about ' kim young man ' ?
you get insul@@ ted by a lot of people . so , short for kim yok mani ( lots of insul@@ ts ) ,
kim y@@ ong man .
are you having fun , mes@@ sing with me ?
very much so .
40 wo@@ o 69@@ 76 ... 69@@ 76 please , pull over ... 40 wo@@ o 69@@ 76 ...
look here !
ais@@ h !
since it is your fault , cover the fine yourself .
i 'm not the one driving , why do i have to pay ?
you 've ran a stop@@ light . please show me your license .
aig@@ oo , you 're working hard .
since i have to atten@@ d an ur@@ gent matter and something like this won 't happen again , can 't you let us off this time ?
yes , please don 't do it again .
- thank you ..
but give me your driver 's license .
your license has ex@@ pi@@ red already . re@@ quest@@ ing ident@@ ity confir@@ mation , re@@ quest@@ ing ident@@ ity confir@@ mation ,
resi@@ dent regi@@ stration no . : 74@@ 110@@ 4-@@ 16@@ 75@@ 138 .
the name , kim bong dal ?
kim as in kim@@ chi , bong as in bon@@ gos , and dal as in dallas .
kim bong dal .
aye , why is he saying that ?
kim bong d ... no fre@@ aking way !
anthony is kim bong dal ... that 's his real name !
aw@@ esome ...
for real ?
excuse me .
you said you didn 't have a kore@@ an name .
kim bong dal .
i wonder if that 's an american name too .
kim bong ..
dal ~ ?
don 't laugh .
i 'm sorry , but the name is so ir@@ resist@@ ible .
kim as in kim@@ chi , bong as in bon@@ gos , [ bong means mountain top ]
dal as in dallas .
[ dal means the moon . ]
it 's so funny !
i 'm sorry but ...
it 's too funny ! kim@@ chi ... bon@@ g@@ wo@@ ori ( meaning " mountain peak " ) ,
dal@@ de@@ onge@@ e ( meaning " round face like the moon " ) . so , november 4@@ th is our kim bong dal 's birthday .
yes , the door is not locked .
yes ...
you 're surprised , aren 't you ?
it 's just a joke !
oh , oh my ... i 'm sorry .
you must have been so surprised .
i thought it was someone else .
not at all .
would you like to come in ? i guess you 've been writing the script , so i 'm afraid if i 'm interrup@@ ting now .
not at all . please have a seat .
i don 't have anything but coffee , is that okay ?
yes .
what brought you here ?
i came to apologi@@ ze .
i 'd like to apologi@@ ze sin@@ cer@@ ely .
mis@@ understanding about your script , that was my mistake .
no , i understand why you mis@@ understood . when i read that book ,
i also thought that different people could come up with similar ideas .
if you think in that way , i 'm than@@ k@@ ful .
but , there 's something i was curious about .
what 's the relationship between you and represent@@ ative ?
was my question a bit odd ?
i was curious about that from the beginning . anthony kim , the previ@@ ous represent@@ ative of empire production , isn 't a person who would wag@@ er everything he has on a new@@ bie writ@@ er 's drama .
what 's up with you two ?
no , there is nothing between the two of us , what do you mean , " relationship " ?
i totally hate a man with that kind of style .
what kind of women in the world would like a man like him ? well , if we must put the word " relationship , " " relationship " of a demon and an angel ?
par@@ don ?
just ... a vic@@ ious represent@@ ative of drama production company and an angel@@ -@@ like writ@@ er ?
something like that ?
but why are you asking that ?
no .
from now on , all of us must run for the high@@ est rat@@ ing of the first episode of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " on november 5@@ th !
yes !
how are our compet@@ it@@ ors of other broadcasting stations going now ?
cur@@ r@@ ently , " return of the king " of k broadcasting is running as the number one in rat@@ ings .
followed by " between lo@@ vers " of m broadcasting in the second .
then , what about s broadcasting ?
its drama is in last with one dig@@ it rat@@ ing ( under 10 % ) .
i don 't think we can get any advantage from the previ@@ ous drama 's rat@@ ing .
last tu@@ es@@ day 's rat@@ ing was 6.@@ 2 % .
it was the worst .
it seems we will have a hard fight .
of course it will be hard , but no matter what , we will win .
from the day when anthony took the position of represent@@ ative to 2009 when he re@@ signed , these are ac@@ coun@@ ting frau@@ d books and the lo@@ bb@@ ying list which used the money from that ac@@ coun@@ ting frau@@ d .
all of them were instruc@@ ted by you , cha@@ ir@@ man , but all ac@@ coun@@ ts and trans@@ actions were done under the name of anthony .
other than that , he didn 't ste@@ al even a single penny from my money ?
yes .
that 's un@@ expected .
well , with these , he would be rot@@ ting in a prison for at least 10 years .
contact our legal team and let them proce@@ ed .
yes .
yes , pd kim .
i called you because i heard our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be introduc@@ ed at your " entertainment tonight . "
yes , yes .
then , please take good care of that .
i 've sent the revis@@ ed script for episode 7 .
mr. kim .
bong .
dal .
yes , mom .
hey , we have big trouble .
come quickly to our restaurant .
what 's going on ?
can 't you see ?
there are so many custom@@ ers here !
a@@ igo ...
i can 't do this by myself !
mom !
is that big trouble ?
of course , it is !
top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is visit@@ ing here himself !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why are you here ?
why ?
to promo@@ te writ@@ er lee 's " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " i 'm here .
they are from my fan club .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
- everyone !
- yes ! this person is the beautiful writ@@ er of our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
- writ@@ er lee .
- yes .
please say something . please say something . please say something .
huh ?
ah ... yes ...
hello !
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
nice to meet you all .
our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
will be ai@@ red soon .
there are not many days left until its first episode .
please promo@@ te our drama a lot .
our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " and here mr@@ .@@ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , no , from now on , kim wo@@ o jin ( the role 's name ) , you will give lots of love to them , right ?
yes !
but , seriously , why are you here ?
i 'm sorry for mis@@ understanding your drama , writ@@ er lee .
i thought that apologi@@ z@@ ing with only words wouldn 't be enough .
so , you want to apologi@@ ze with money and your fans ?
because i have nothing but only money and fans !
then , i will get going for film@@ ing now .
again , sorry ! see you later !
goodbye !
yes , represent@@ ative ?
you want me to am@@ end all of the script for episode 7 ?
not all of them but scene 42 and scene 43 with that cl@@ um@@ sy melo@@ drama part .
clu@@ m ... cl@@ um@@ sy ?
it even has the kiss scene of the main two charac@@ ters , but where do you mean is it cl@@ um@@ sy ?
writ@@ er lee , when you kiss a man , are you doing it in this way ?
huh ?
no , i mean , have you ever kissed a man ?
i have !
then , do it .
what ?
!
in my eyes , the kiss scene in scene 43 gives only the feeling of two wooden st@@ icks hit@@ ting each other .
so , i 'm telling you to try it yourself , writ@@ er lee .
par@@ don ?
pd jo@@ o , read out loud scene 43 .
well , everyone , let 's see .
scene 43 , inside of modern club . sad piano music is filling the empty club ,
kim wo@@ o jin is sitting alone in front of the piano and playing it .
at this moment , with ti@@ p-@@ tap , ti@@ p-@@ tap sound of high heels , a woman appro@@ aches wo@@ o jin .
what are you doing ?
i told you to try it yourself .
even if wo@@ o jin sensed h@@ ye rin coming near him , he doesn 't stop playing . h@@ ye rin grab@@ s his hand .
wo@@ o jin stop@@ s playing the piano .
h@@ ye rin spe@@ aks . " from now on , your playing piano , can you do it only for me ? "
wo@@ o jin st@@ ays still , not taking his eyes off the piano .
h@@ ye rin spe@@ aks .
" even if i lie to you , even if i .... even if i betr@@ ay you , i 'm asking if you can play the piano , only for me . "
" no . " after that , wo@@ o jin stands up , staring at h@@ ye rin , and kisses her ?
even that dum@@ b k@@ ang hy@@ un min won 't be able to grab sung min ah and kiss her !
i 'm not an act@@ ress , though !
a writ@@ er is supposed to write to make ac@@ tors act !
if you feel so w@@ ron@@ ged , then go ahead , ask these male vie@@ wers what they think .
that 's why you should rev@@ ise it . i don 't think it 's because you don 't like melo@@ dram@@ as , but because you can 't write them . pd jo@@ o , contact the assistant director and tell him scene 42 and scene 43 will be revis@@ ed , so he should proce@@ ed with the other scenes ' film@@ ing , except for those scenes .
the reason ...
don 't ask me why .
what i can do for you is ...
cut !
ng !
min ah , this is already the four@@ th ng . it 's not a difficult line , but what 's wrong ?
i 'm sorry , director .
then , let 's take a 10-@@ minute break !
we will res@@ ume after 10-@@ minute break !
what are you doing , being so chil@@ dish ?
then , what about you , miss sung min ah ?
you chil@@ dis@@ h@@ ly doub@@ ted writ@@ er lee , but have you apologi@@ z@@ ed to her ?
what 's that with today 's film@@ ing ?
if you hum@@ ili@@ ated a person public@@ ly , shouldn 't you offici@@ ally apologi@@ ze to her in front of all of them ?
i apologi@@ z@@ ed to her offici@@ ally , so please , stop that mor@@ onic act .

10 seconds .
5@@ seconds 4,@@ 3 , 2 , 1 start ! 4,@@ 3 , 2 , 1 start !
we have a start with 7.1 %
not a great start .
what do we do ? it 's been 30 minutes , and it 's at 6.@@ 8 % .
we 're still the low@@ est .
where are you going ?
it 's still in the middle of the broad@@ cast !
it 's all over .
it 's only been 30 minutes since the show started .
half an hour has passed already and the rat@@ ing is in the p@@ its .
we have lost .
in total mis@@ ery .
so you 're here .
that 's why i told you . we need to go for melo@@ drama , not noir .
aj@@ um@@ mah , can i get a glass here , too ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to drink too .
go work on your script .
i want to be alone .
thank you .
represent@@ ative kim .

i suppose .
the aver@@ age vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing has been calcul@@ ated .
speak .
yes .
yes .
i understand .
the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing res@@ ult is in ?
we must have had a spike towards the end .
vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing is 15.@@ 7 % .
we 're in the lead !
oh my !
15.@@ 7 !
this is aw@@ esome !
we 've hit it off big !
- con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
- jack@@ pot !
jack@@ pot !
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
this is just the beginning .
aw@@ esome !
we 're first !
15.@@ 7 %
- 15.@@ 7 % - thanks , lord !
yes ?
15.@@ 7 % ?
first ?
oh my !
yes , what did i tell you ?
didn 't i tell you ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' would be a succes@@ s ?
i 'm anthony after all .
where are you going ?
i should go work on the script with this energy !
forget the script , tonight you should drink !
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes , i understand .
finally the era of k@@ ang hy@@ un min has started .
conqu@@ er korea , then japan , china , taiwan , and then the whole world !
didn 't i tell you we 'd definitely be succes@@ s ?
t@@ ch !
don 't you remember what you just said a while ago ?
what did i tell you ?
we shouldn 't have gone with noir .
when did i ?
at any rate , i think this is mean@@ ing@@ ful in so many different ways .
especially that we got the high@@ est rat@@ ing with a genre that hadn 't been attemp@@ ted in korea before . of course , the produc@@ er 's eye in dis@@ cer@@ ning the right script was especially cru@@ cial .
what about the prom@@ ising writ@@ er 's writing skil@@ ls with ten@@ ac@@ ity ?
you sure are a prom@@ ising writ@@ er , but you still have a long way to go .
at any rate , a drama writ@@ er needs to know how to write good melo@@ drama .
nothing like that pa@@ the@@ tic kissing scene .
that talk again ! tell me tru@@ th@@ fully , you 've never had a kiss right ?
that of cour@@ s-
you haven 't felt your heart beating for a man .
i 've felt it before .
not just a chil@@ dish crus@@ h .
i 've definitely ,
you 've definitely not experienced that .
seriously , aren 't you drinking a little too much ?
you were already drinking before i came here .
i 'm anthony .
mere alcohol can 't defe@@ at me .
pd jo@@ o , where are you ?
eh ?
soo@@ won ?
it 's nothing .
well , it 's just ... no , never mind .
ah man , ah , dar@@ n !
mere alcohol what ?
can 't defe@@ at me ?
seriously !
i guess ... it 's my fault ... for drinking with him .
sleep well . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
don 't ever drink again !
what do you think about me ?
yes ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
see you tomorrow ~ pre@@ view so what you two are saying right now ..
.. is that you have a problem with the kiss scene in episode 7 ? that 's right .
you are under ar@@ rest for professional neg@@ li@@ gence and mis@@ appropri@@ ation of fun@@ ds .
exactly why do you hate me so much ?
i 'll kill you .
stop sab@@ ot@@ ag@@ ing the production of " morning in k@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ ong , " al@@ read !
please ! how dare you order me around ?
if you 've got a nice lady friend , you can bring her to me .
i 'll show you when i find one .
what have you been doing all those years without ever dating a boyfriend ?
how i hate him , hate him .
the mother of mr. kim bong dal is seriously ill .
mo , mother ?
mom !
mom !
episode 12 no enemy is permanent how do you think of me as a man ? well ...
this is called " melo@@ drama . " this heart@@ beating , flut@@ tering , this is " melo@@ drama " right there ! so , now , go and rev@@ ise that melo@@ drama scene .
what was that ? that scared me ... what kind of human being is he ?
seriously !
what do you think about me ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
what man ?
but why couldn 't i say no at that moment ?
no .
that was because i was to@@ yed in a flash .
that 's right .
crazy bong dal ...
so embarras@@ sing !
who is it ?
who is it ?
it 's me .
what 's this ?
what is he doing here ?
why are you here ?
i have something to say , so open the door first .
what do you have to say ?
you didn 't answer me before .
huh ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
i 'm thinking of you in this way .
oh , that was a relief . ( because it was a dream . )
what 's a relief ?
what time do you think it is now that you 're still in bed ?
since when have you been here ?
since a little while ago .
when i came in , you were pa@@ wing the air as if you were a tur@@ tle which was flipped over .
even if you are the produc@@ er , how could you come in a female writ@@ er 's studio though@@ t@@ lessly ?
this is a writ@@ er 's studio paid by my money and opened by me .
but that writ@@ er didn 't even answer the phone call and didn 't show any reaction to the door because she was too busy sleeping .
so , what else can i do , then ?
if you need to sleep that much , do you think you can survive in this drama industry ?
why did you come ?
hurry and rev@@ ise the melo@@ drama scene of episode 7 and send it to us .
we need to film that scene on this thur@@ s@@ day .
i will rev@@ ise that scene !
do it quickly ! well !
get out !
even if you don 't tell me to go , i will leave .
and from now on , even if you 're sleeping , when i call you , answer it .
because i don 't want to see you pa@@ wing the air when i 'm so busy .
ah , seriously ... " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " from the first episode , w@@ ins mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day .
wo@@ o hoo ~ " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " from the first episode , w@@ ins mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day .
" k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's char@@ is@@ ma was shining . "
" indeed , it was k@@ ang hy@@ un min , just like everybody said . "
[ sung min ah , her come@@ back drama after 3 years shows its signal of succes@@ s . "
min ah , what are you doing ?
oh , you 're here .
what ?
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " the pion@@ eer of new drama genre . " cat@@ ching two birds and great harmon@@ y between a vet@@ eran director and a new@@ bie writ@@ er .
" writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i 've never heard of her name , but she 's the best ! " " even if she 's a new@@ bie , her writing is aw@@ esome ! "
then , let 's proce@@ ed with it accor@@ d@@ ng@@ ly .
you 've worked hard ! you 've work hard . well , and this one has not only a good rat@@ ing , but also the reaction ( from the vie@@ wers ) is really great .
it went so vir@@ al . this drama hit the jack@@ pot , jack@@ pot !
did it ? well , i think , our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , don 't you think we should start manag@@ ing her ? ( meaning " keeping her " )
do you know what people on the internet say about lee go e@@ un ?
they say " the next writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un ( one of the best kore@@ an drama writ@@ ers ) . "
i think we should give her at least a present or something .
what kind of present do you think would be good ?
- a present ?
- yes !
cp lee .
- let 's calm down a little bit , please .
- calm down ?
i will leave now .
so , not a present , but calm down ?
hello ?
is this writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
yes . who is it ?
hello .
this is reporter kim e@@ un he@@ e from wo@@ o ri daily new@@ sp@@ aper .
i called you because i 'd like to have an interview .
interview ?
with whom ?
with you , writ@@ er lee .
you want to have an interview with me ?
yes , reporter kim .
yes .
but , can i pick the place ? ( to have an interview )
is there any special reason you picked this place ?
yes .
because " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " started from this place .
- here ?
- yes .
when i was living here , i came up with its idea and wrote its first draft .
then , this is the most perfect place to have an interview with you , writ@@ er lee . after the first episode of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " was ai@@ red , its reaction ( from the vie@@ wers ) was very good .
who is the first one you think of or you are grateful of ?
of course it 's my mom , mrs. park k@@ ang ja .
if it weren 't for my mom , i wouldn 't have been able to write again .
- your mother ?
- yes .
oh , and there is one more person .
who else ? even if that person has really bad person@@ ality and is heart@@ less , because this guy made me go through so much hard@@ ship , but if it weren 't that person , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " couldn 't have been born .
who is that person ?
mr. kim bong dal .
how does it feel to be outside ?
it has been a while since you had fresh air .
i feel so good .
i can hear the sound of spring coming , too .
the sound of spring coming ?
for spring to come , we still have to wait for a long time . like the sound of spring coming ,
i can hear the sound of some welcome guest coming .
that drama was really enjo@@ y@@ able .
if you think it 's enjo@@ y@@ able , then it 's really enjo@@ y@@ able .
it 's rat@@ ing is really good , too .
you 've worried a lot , haven 't you ?
me ?
no .
from the beginning , i knew it would be succes@@ s@@ ful .
whatever your son makes will be the best , so don 't worry at all . don 't work too hard like that , and if you have a good girl , you should show her to me , too . even if i can 't see her , if i hear her voice ,
i will be able to know how good a woman she is .
if i have , i will show her to you , then .
um@@ m .. for a while , even if you 're busy , please come visit her often .
even though she doesn 't show it , her condition has been quite bad these days .
yes , i understand .
yes .
yes , speaking .
this is pro@@ secu@@ tor kim dong chan from the tax@@ ation investig@@ ation unit of seoul central pro@@ secu@@ tor 's office .
there is a compl@@ aint fil@@ ed against you , so you should come now .
what are you talking about ?
don 't you understand what i 'm saying ?
i 'm saying you 've been sum@@ mon@@ ed .
unless you want to be hum@@ ili@@ ated in front of your family , come here right away ! so , you 're saying you can 't admit all the charges descri@@ bed here ?
yes , that 's right .
but , according to the materi@@ als we 've received , the evidence is pretty clear .
from 2006 , 2007 and ... until 2009 .
see for yourself .
it seems like the material sub@@ mit@@ ted by empire production .
even all the little details about you are descri@@ bed . i understand how you feel now , but let 's proce@@ ed with it simply not drag@@ ging too much time .
please let me have a cros@@ s-@@ examin@@ ation with oh jin wan , the accus@@ er .

yes , pd jo@@ o .
yes , represent@@ ative .

i couldn 't reach you for a while .

you always ask me for some favor when you come .
it 's alright , you can say it . hey ,
i really came just to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you .
i said it 's alright .
what is it this time ?
about the kiss scene ...
isn 't it rather awkward ?
it 's like putting two stick figures together .
i 'm working on a revision anyway ,
oh really !
of course !
i knew it !
seriously , didn 't i tell you that there 's no need to worry , g@@ wang so@@ o ? i mean , i was ok , but he was losing sleep over it because he was worried for me , so my heart beat went be@@ ep .

by the way , that person , i 've never seen her before .
she is the new f@@ d .
ah , f@@ d ... [ meet writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " the new drama in the news . ]
.... " and she expres@@ sed her grat@@ itude to mr. kim bong dal as well . " represent@@ ative , the photo of writ@@ er lee looks really great , doesn 't it ?
well , just so-@@ so .
by the way , who do you think would be that kim bong dal ?
who knows .
but , isn 't his name so funny ?
these days , people don 't use such a rust@@ ic name .
kim bong dal ... ?
koo he@@ e j@@ ae .
yes .
don 't concern about other people 's names , and do your job driving proper@@ ly .
yes .
in a situation of diver@@ gent love , they 're kissing ...
kiss ... by grabbing her hand , wo@@ o jin stop@@ s her from leaving .
how do you think of me as a man ?
the door is not locked .
ah , one sec ...
what is that ?
that dum@@ b expression ?
what 's wrong with my expression ?
aren 't you curious ?
about what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
the rat@@ ing for episode 2 , i mean .
ah , how was it ?
16.@@ 2 % . we 're still the high@@ est , but with the second high@@ est , the difference is only 0.8 % , so don 't lo@@ osen up yet .
yes .
did you rev@@ ise that kiss scene ?
yes , of course .
how is it ?
it 's okay .
from now on , do it well on your own .
par@@ don ?
what have you done so far , not having dat@@ ed anyone ?
well , i guess no man would stick around to put up with all your bad tem@@ per .
ah , from now on , if you 're grateful , say it to me person@@ ally .
don 't beat around the bush by saying it to a reporter .
ge@@ ez , that guy ...
he really makes me not like him .
does it hurt a lot ?
yes , it hur@@ ts craz@@ ily .
is that wen@@ ch crazy ?
what face does she think she de@@ als with ... seriously ...
op@@ pa .
huh ? your cheek went in further , so your chin looks even longer .

no ... sung min ah , this fo@@ x-@@ like wen@@ ch !
by the way , hy@@ ung .
what ? i received the revis@@ ed script , but its kiss scene seems even stronger now .
what ?
... " kisses her . "
op@@ pa !
you said there is no kiss scene !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
get ready with the car .
par@@ don ?
where are you going ?
are you asking that because you don 't know ? so , when they said it would be revis@@ ed , they meant that she 's writing the kiss scene better .
with that mor@@ on ?
give me the phone .
" the number you called isn 't avail@@ able at the moment ... " then , about the fun@@ ds he sn@@ uck out , are you saying you have no knowledge , mr. oh jin wan ?
yes .
i had no knowledge of it . sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , why don 't you tell him the truth ?
all that money , what did you do with that ?
pro@@ secu@@ tor .
chief pro@@ secu@@ tor wants you to call him .
i got it .
let 's take a short break .
what on earth do you think you 're doing now ?
as if you don 't know .
you would know well that i wouldn 't die alone .
where and when i used that money , do you want me to sp@@ ill it all out ?
try it , then .
because i 've already got rid of all evidence of that money being used for lo@@ bb@@ ying .
and there is no evidence it was done by cha@@ ir@@ man 's instruction .
what we have are only the traces of trans@@ actions of all that money in your bank account .
why on earth ... do you hate me so much ?
if this is because of all hum@@ ili@@ ation i 've given you ...
hum@@ ili@@ ation ...
no .
you wouldn 't know how it feels even if you came back from death . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
director oh , director oh ... even if i was called so s@@ ick@@ ly and treated even less than a bug , such things can still be er@@ ased . however , because your bul@@ ls * * t@@ ting philoso@@ phy that you should even abandon your father for a drama ,
as long as that moment , that memory re@@ mains in my brain , you ...
i 'm going to kill you .
well , then , let 's stop this cros@@ s-@@ examin@@ ation .
you can go back now .
wait . where do you think you 're going ?
for der@@ el@@ ic@@ tion of duty and em@@ bez@@ z@@ lement , you 're arrest@@ ed without war@@ rant . until the war@@ rant is appro@@ ved , for the next 48 hours , you can 't leave this office , not even a step . ah , these days , because of that guy , i had a big head@@ ache , but thanks to you , i 'm relieved now .
yes , please take good care of this case .
yes .
arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant ?
why is that all of a sudden ?
that 's why you should have min@@ ded your behavi@@ ors .
i asked you why !
can 't you tell just by looking at this ?
you 're in a serious bin@@ d right now .
even if you had to part ways with him , you shouldn 't have done that to your superior .
hey , kim jo@@ o y@@ ong !
it 's been a while .
yes , what 's going on ?
oh , end@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ year ga@@ thering ? well , actually , cur@@ r@@ ently , at my district pro@@ secu@@ tor 's office , the represent@@ ative of the production company of one of your dram@@ as has been arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant ?
who from our dram@@ as ?
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " sounded like it 's still going on .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
is represent@@ ative kim there ?
yes , but i don 't think he 'll be released easily .
seems like there was an order from the hig@@ her@@ up@@ s .
someone must be behind all this .
okay ...
thanks .
she 'd said she 'd rev@@ ise it ... how dare she make a fool of me ?
!
hy@@ ung we 're here .
oh , why are you here ?
why ?
do you have to ask ? so , let me get this straight , both of you have issues with the kissing scene in episode 7 ?
that 's right .
-@@ that 's right .
but both of you knew that there will be some romance later in the story . although they realize that they love each other more than any@@ body , they have to be enem@@ ies , so this is a pi@@ vo@@ tal turning point for these two charac@@ ters .
that 's what makes it all the more trag@@ ic .
a kiss doesn 't make it more trag@@ ic , though , to leave it as trag@@ ic , they should just stare at each other .
which we can pull off well enough with our acting skil@@ ls .
exactly !
at any rate , change it like that .
without the kiss .
after revis@@ ing the previ@@ ous draft because it was considered too bl@@ and , i can 't do that .
who said that ?
i mean , who said that it 's bl@@ and ? well , i 'm not saying that i revis@@ ed it because of one person 's opinion , but i also thought it was bl@@ and after all , so i ended up revis@@ ing it . also , if , by any chance , this is because you don 't get along with each other , i 'll be seriously disap@@ pointed .
un@@ ni , do we not get a long ? [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
i wouldn 't say we don 't . [ still uses honor@@ ific@@ s ]
what does the director say ?
no matter what the director says , i can 't do it .
no , i won 't .
don 't change your word later .
we have to be persist@@ ent to the end .
just make sure that you don 't change your words .
don 't worry .
i also have no desire to kiss you .
well then , that 's good . if i could avoid kissing that fire@@ fox ,
i 'd glad@@ ly sw@@ im in the ocean again ! if i have to kiss that mor@@ on , i 'd rather have my character shot dead so i can quit the drama .
so , hy@@ ung , do you think writ@@ er lee will rev@@ ise it ?
after all , you did end up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean .
jesus christ !
no way !
mor@@ on
yes ? i 'd like to share from my experience of ending up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean , if we really want to avoid the kiss scene , we have to present an appropri@@ ate alternative .
alternative ?
for ex@@ ample , we could make the revision our@@ selves and give it to her .
that 's not a bad idea .
this one , this one , this one , this one ! take out " he kisses her , " and change it to " woo@@ jin gaz@@ es at her . "
well , that does@@ nt work with the flow of the movement from the earlier scene .
you also have to take out the " he grab@@ s her hand and stop@@ s her from leaving . "
then , how is he going to gaze at her ?
just blan@@ k@@ ly ?
can 't you pull it off with your acting skil@@ ls ?
well , i have to see you to try acting .
then , why don 't we each fix our own parts .
okay , fine . i got it . i 'm hanging up .
good .
that idiot .
dar@@ n , that vi@@ xen .
man , if she 's going to do it anyway , why doesn 't she fix mine , too ...
jesus christ .
oh , writ@@ er lee .
your revision of the kiss scene is great !
but , represent@@ ative kim isn 't here ?
no . he left in the morning .
what is it ?
nothing , just wondering why i couldn 't reach him .
let 's not waste any more time here .
no matter what , you 'll end up in prison .
just f@@ ess up everything so that your sent@@ ence can get reduc@@ ed at least , mr. stif@@ f-@@ neck !
man , what is he doing with his phone turned off all day ?
yes , director , this is writ@@ er lee .
could i see you for a moment ?
" no matter what the director says , i can 't do it ? "
" no , i won 't ? "
no , that 's not it , director . that 's ...
i didn 't know you were such a s@@ nit@@ ch , writ@@ er lee .
excuse me ?
a s@@ nit@@ ch ? director ... in the end , what you 're saying is that you absolutely can 't do the kiss scene .
that 's correct . i 'm really sorry , but i just can 't do it , director .
yes , me too . fine , if you have to have things your way , then i 'll do things my way , too .
you know about my past , right ?
if i say i quit , i do quit !
and once i get started on something , there 's no stopping me . the past five years , i was dro@@ wning in wine , ru@@ in@@ ing my life , then turned around to work really hard on a drama .
once i drink this , i have no idea what might become of me .
what are you going to do ?
can you do it or not ?
the taste of wine is drag@@ ging me back to alco@@ hol@@ ism .
director !
director !
i 'll do it .
and you , min ah ? i 'll do it , but , i can 't drink any alcohol , director .
then go and have a good night 's sleep .
tomorrow we have a full sched@@ ule ahead !
i understand .
i 'm leaving .
ah , really how can you keep drinking ?
you have a drink too .
re@@ fresh@@ ing cas@@ sia se@@ ed tea is good for your health .
what ?
cas@@ sia se@@ ed tea ?
oh !
this really isn 't alcohol .
ah , you really shocked me !
this is what it means to be " se@@ as@@ oned . "
it 's good ! someone was so confid@@ ent about not changing his mind , but i shouldn 't have trust@@ ed someone 's words .
then what about you ?
who suggested it first ?
you 'd better brush your teeth proper@@ ly ( before film@@ ing the kiss scene ) .
four times per day !
you 'd better have your teeth scal@@ ed !
the represent@@ ative hasn 't come back yet ? yes , his cell phone is still turned off , so i was worried and waiting for him , but now i 'm about to go home .
he has never been like this before .
represent@@ ative ?
ah , yes ...
who ?
i 'm sorry but there is no one named kim bong dal in this company .
yes .
i 'm sorry , but i guess you dial@@ ed the wrong number .
hold on , pd jo@@ o .
hold on , please .
hello .
hello , this is from cham@@ som@@ ang sanat@@ orium .
sanat@@ orium ?
yes .
is there anyone named kim bong dal ?
ah , if you tell me what you called for , i will leave the message for him .
i called because mr. kim bong dal 's mother is in crit@@ ical condition now .
mo ... his mother ?
yes . please tell him he must come now .
well , wait a moment , where is your sanat@@ orium ?
okay .
what is the reason you came to visit me ?
regar@@ ding the pro@@ secu@@ tor 's investig@@ ation about represent@@ ative kim , which is cur@@ r@@ ently happening , please halt it right away .
i didn 't know that you cher@@ ished anthony that much , director nam .
no !
stop trying to sab@@ ot@@ age the production of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " please !
how dare you order me to stop ...
father !
it has already been for 20 years that you didn 't acknow@@ ledge me as your father , shut@@ ting me off .
but now , are you taking sides with that bastard who back@@ stab@@ bed your father ?
i got it .
then , not as your son , but as director of s@@ bc drama department , please let me re@@ phrase it . your con@@ temp@@ tible action , mr@@ .@@ cha@@ ir@@ man , then can you stop doing this ? anthony , that bastard has also lived in the way which you are con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous of , so he 's just pur@@ ged of that sin .
that 's all .
pur@@ ged of the sin ?
then , do you think you 're not guilty ?
what ?
please stop .
okay ?
and also ... as you said , i 've been shut@@ ting you off for last 20 years . but if you still have thoughts of me as your son , and if you don 't want to lose your one and only son forever , please stop , i beg you .
yes .
huh ?
!
i understand .
let 's do that .
you ... you 're really capable , i guess . i don 't know why , but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind .
the charges are dropped , and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened .
ah , yes , i 'm really sorry to bother you for this .
some@@ time soon , i 'll ar@@ range a meeting .
let 's have dinner together .
ah , yes ... yes , then ...
let me ask you just one thing .
what is the reason you tried to protect that bastard ?
please let me tell you once again .
what i want to protect is only the drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " which i 'm in charge of as director of drama department . and also , your interrup@@ tion in my drama by using that dirty trick , i hope that never happens again from now on .
fine .
but you should know this one thing at least . that dirty trick you 're talking about , you also had benef@@ its from it .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of fac@@ tion or connec@@ tions ?
what ... what are you talking about ?
that 's right .
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you desp@@ ise so much !
anthony is released ?
what are you saying ?
!
i heard that the case is closed now .
i think that cha@@ ir@@ man ordered to drop the charges .
the cha@@ ir@@ man ?
it 's me , mr. cha@@ ir@@ man .
i don 't know what to say to express my grat@@ itude .
you 'd better thank director nam wo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ong .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of fac@@ tion or connec@@ tions ?
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you desp@@ ise so much !
what br@@ ings you here at this late hour , represent@@ ative kim ?
i came to say thank you . well , i don 't know what you 've heard or where , but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but can i ask you how you resol@@ ved it ?
i don 't think i have to tell you about that .
yeah .
yes ?
yes , it 's me .
huh ?
mom ...
mom !
how did this happen ?
this afternoon , her condition sud@@ de@@ ly became crit@@ ical .
but luc@@ kil@@ y , the crit@@ ical moment is gone , and now she 's stable .
so , you don 't need to worry so much .
are you ok ?
i didn 't know your mother was still alive .
why did you say it like that before ?
that she had passed away .
i ... really hated them .
our extreme po@@ ver@@ ty , my father who abandon@@ ed me as soon as i was born , whose face i 've never seen , and even my mother who is blind .
i hated them all and was as@@ ham@@ ed of them .
when i got to the usa , i made a resolution .
that i will forget everything that happened in korea . from now on , i 'm anthony , i don 't know anything about po@@ ver@@ ty , and i grew up in the states , i 'm anthony .
and that 's what i told everybody , too . that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as in@@ herit@@ ance .
that i grew up with a happy chil@@ d@@ hood .
i 'm ... a big co@@ ward .
what 's the next scene ?
kim wo@@ o jin and jin h@@ ye rin 's kissing scene .
is it ?
and the ac@@ tors ?
a kissing scene with that mor@@ on ?
just thinking about it makes me sick !
min ah , just close your eyes and get over with it , please ?
what else can we do at this point ?
hy@@ ung .
do you really have to go that far ?
affa@@ wh@@ as@@ hi@@ dit@@ amel@@ ash@@ time ?
( after what she did to me last time ?
)
af@@ car@@ sha@@ haf@@ tag@@ oth@@ ish@@ far .
( of course i have to go this far . )
af@@ car@@ sh .
( of course . )
if you are ready , you may come out .
from now on , can you play the piano only for me ?
even if i were to betr@@ ay you ?
even if i were to dece@@ ive you ?
could you still play it only for me ?
cut !
ah , min ah , what 's wrong ?
you were doing so well !
go brush your teeth before i throw a fit . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
yes , no@@ ona .
i knew you 'd say that .
" is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for ? "
" of course , it 's my mom . mrs. park k@@ ang ja . "
of course , of course it 's your mom .
who else but your mom ?
by the way , mom ...
what is it ?
there is someone i know ... whose past is so full of pain that he can 't get over it ...
sure , there are people like that .
he wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she 's alive .
does that make him a bad person ?
of course that makes him a bad person .
then why the he@@ ck would someone not think of him as a bad person ?
well , that means that someone likes that person .
why ?
is this about you ?
no !
it 's for my drama .
so cold . aun@@ ty , i 've come for some gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els !
oh !
welcome !
and that 's what i told other people , too .
that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as in@@ herit@@ ance . that i grew up with a happy chil@@ d@@ hood .
i 'm ... a big co@@ ward ...
what are you thinking about ?
i couldn 't reach you at all all day yesterday .
did something happen ?
nothing really .
you did that back then , too .
five years ago , when you broke up with me and left .
like yesterday , i couldn 't reach you at all all of a sudden . after trans@@ forming the ro@@ o@@ kie act@@ ress sung min ah into the god@@ dess of melo@@ dram@@ as , you deser@@ ted me , leaving as if you were running away .
i 've told you already .
i 've er@@ ased all my memories of you .
don 't lie .
though you may not have had started out that way , towards the end , you ended up loving me .
yes , i admit that i did like you .
then , why did you leave ?
you 're an act@@ ress who should be loved by everybody . if that 's the only reason , don 't leave me ever again .
episode 14 from dus@@ k till dawn ready , action ! fire !
h@@ ye rin ! ah@@ jus@@ si , you@@ can '@@ ts@@ le@@ eph@@ ere ! fire !

people getting hurt at my set ...
i can 't just stand around and watch !
represent@@ ative !

i 'm alright .
we should worry about that person .
what 's with all of you ?
like people who were w@@ ishing that i wouldn 't get out .
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blo@@ wing in my direction , it 's killing my eyes .
represent@@ ative , are you okay ?
i 'm okay .
what about the other person ?
they 're doing first aid for now , his condition seems to be rather sever@@ e .
how is his blood pressure ?
180 .
how much ?
97 .
move him to inten@@ sive care !
yes .
where is the hospital ?
i have to go there as well .
the director said the ac@@ tors and staff shouldn 't come .
and just stand by near here .
he will contact us .
what are you thinking about ?
the extra who died on my set on that day , 5 years ago ...
that day comes up again and again in my memory .
5 years earlier .
what do we do ?
!
you bastard !
bring my son back to life !
i 'm telling you to bring him back !
my preci@@ ous son !
bring him back ...
where are you going ?
for now , don 't look for me .
then@@ what@@ ab@@ out@@ my@@ drama ?

and were really grateful .
yes ? but why does your voice sound so fr@@ ail ?
but why does your voice sound so fr@@ ail ?
did something happen ?
no .
work is going well , so don 't worry too much .
don 't get too hung up on the script without sle@@ ping , and take it easy .
don 't over@@ work .
yes , i 'll do that .
hello !

mom , i 'll give you a call later on .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i was worried ...
how is he ?
he just went into inten@@ sive care , we 're all waiting for him to wake up .
actually , i was surprised . i 'm sorry to you for thinking this way , but that you would come here yourself ,
i would never have imagined it .
it 's what i should do .
you must be tired , you can go and wash up .
you don 't have to worry because i 'm here .
writ@@ er !
it was my fault .
what ?
what does that ...
i ... saw him . no , no , no .
bit na ... she 's the lead act@@ ress , so i have to act with her .
how can we film se@@ per@@ ately ?
any@@ ways , i 'm a little busy so i 'll call you later .
i 'm hanging up .
what a scar@@ e !
ah@@ jus@@ si !
you can 't sleep here .
hey , bit na , if you 're going to be like this i 'm going to get mad !
got it ?
back then , if i ... had only wo@@ ken him up ...
no ...
if i had called another person ... it wouldn 't have turned out like that .
don 't blame yourself too much .
you couldn 't have imagined the situation would be like this .
no one could .
even so ... if only i had given it a little thought this wouldn 't have happen .
aig@@ oo .
i fully understand what you 're feeling .
don 't think about it this neg@@ ativ@@ ely .
because that man can get up again .
really ?
of course . everyone is pr@@ aying sing@@ le-@@ hear@@ tedly , so it will turn out well .
so che@@ er up . k@@ ang hy@@ un min style .
my style ?
korea 's top star k@@ ang hy@@ un min , your high@@ ness ' style .
like brad pit@@ t ?
yes , like brad pit@@ t .
why did you come here ?
he said he came because he was worried .
how is he ?
exter@@ n@@ ally he has minor bur@@ ns , the problem are intern@@ al in@@ jur@@ ies of the lung .
fo@@ tun@@ ately the intern@@ al in@@ jur@@ ies are also minor .

i 'll be at the car .
take your time to get ready and come out .
okay , got it .
represent@@ ative , no !
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blo@@ wing in my directions , it 's killing my eyes .
represent@@ ative ! - ah , team leader .
you were looking for me ?
give him enough money for him to get proper treat@@ ment until he fully reco@@ vers .
yes .
also quickly prepare the compen@@ sation so he can rece@@ ive it soon .

ah , nothing .
represent@@ ative , today ... you were totally cool .

don 't we have to shoot the last scene ? of course we have to shoot it !
that little bastard k@@ ang hy@@ un min has changed quite a lot .
he did , didn 't he ?
but it 's not as much as the change of " someone . "
what are you talking about ?
i 'm talking about " someone " who was the original col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded as@@ sh@@ ole but now suddenly changed to a nice guy .
tell me .
why did you run into the fire ?
huh ?
everybody was at a loss , not knowing what to do , but why did you run into the fire despite its danger ?
i just went inside .

even so a person i work with came back from the dead .
what am i supposed to do .
so ... now you 're saying that aj@@ us@@ shi is more important than i am ?
that 's not what i 'm saying .
you 're saying you can 't come because some nobody extra got hurt .
what ?
some nobody extra ?
what ?
am i wrong ?
how can you say something like that ?
so ru@@ de@@ ly ?

op@@ pa , are you ... mad at me right now ?

writ@@ er lee , let 's go together in my car .
yes .
it 's rain@@ ing all of a sudden .
this is the first time i 've rid@@ den in a car with a writ@@ er like this .
yes .
ah , you said before , that you and represent@@ ative kim are like an angel and a demon .
ah , before ...
what happened so that he 's called as a demon@@ -@@ like bad produc@@ er ?
i 'm just curious if he was different ( to you ) from represent@@ ative kim whom i know .
frank@@ ly speaking , i like represent@@ ative kim .
no , i mean , two of us used to love each other , so we 're trying to work it out from now on .
i 'm hoping you , writ@@ er lee , can help our relationship .
you can tell re@@ presen@@ ative kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him .
all of you , aren 't you embarrassed to bring me this rat@@ ing chart ?
cp choi of the daily drama .
yes , deput@@ y director .
why do you think your rat@@ ing is bad ?
why is such bad rat@@ ings happening ?
and , " children of paradise , " make it end within this month . it 's qu@@ ality is good and the reaction from vie@@ wers is getting better .
it 's qu@@ ality is good and the reaction from vie@@ wers is getting better .
qu@@ ality , potential ... do you think such things will bring more adver@@ tis@@ ement ?
until when will you wait for the bit@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ bit increas@@ ing rat@@ ing ?
the next drama after " children of paradise ... "
where is cp oh ?
oh , cp oh !
don 't make some tri@@ vial one , but something sens@@ ational , something stun@@ ning ! yes .
listen carefully !
i care about only rat@@ ing .
rat@@ ing , rat@@ ing , rat@@ ing !
do proper@@ ly , please !
shall we buy a dog , too ?
no way . i really hate dogs .
- why not ?
we love dogs a lot .
- then , who will take care of it ?
you must be coming back from gro@@ cer@@ y shopping .
you should say hello . hello !
hello !
oh this kid .
you look a lot like your dad , huh ?
but , who are you ah@@ jus@@ si ?
ah , someone dad works with .
go in , first .
let 's go home .
goodbye .
i 'm sure you 've heard the news , and i have nothing to say to you .
please , just leave .
were you somebody who feels so little respon@@ sibil@@ ity ?
what is your reason ? you tried hard to change all sh@@ ady dirty tr@@ icks by even ris@@ king your director position , but now , what on earth is the reason you stepped down from that position ? well , i 'm sorry for not taking respon@@ sibil@@ ity for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " until the end , but i can 't tell you why .
please leave . until i hear that reason , i can 't leave . the director position i got was given not by my compet@@ ence , but by that sh@@ ady trick which i desp@@ ised so much , and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ? and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ?
what do you mean ?
nam go@@ ok h@@ ye@@ on , cha@@ ir@@ man of empire group .
i got the position because of my father 's power .
maybe , that 's why i hated you more , represent@@ ative kim .
to me , you seemed worse than my father .
i wanted to den@@ y such father , so i have lived , thinking i don 't have a father .
i wanted to hide it until the end if i could .
well , then that 's enough for the reason , isn 't it ?
no .
if that is why ( you re@@ signed ) , it can 't be a reason to me even more .
i also had a family whom i wanted to den@@ y once .
but even so , i didn 't run away from the path i had to go .
you once told me that people like me should dis@@ appear from this field .
but in the end , i 'm still here , but you 're leaving .
before you leave , just keep this in your mind .
then , at the end , there will be only dirty people left with sh@@ ady tr@@ icks .
now hy@@ un min , pass the th@@ ug@@ s sent by choi , look towards min ah .
hy@@ un min 's face is full of surprise !
that 's right , that 's right !
good ! still in shock , hy@@ un min 's line !
hy@@ un min , what about your line ?
i 'm done with you !
have your way with the shooting sno@@ g@@ ging your o@@ h-@@ so-@@ bel@@ o@@ ved sung min ah !
huh ?
um , isn 't she ... yo@@ on bit na of the idol group angels ? yo@@ on bit na of the idol group angels ?
( mor@@ on )
let 's take a break for 5 minutes .
yes .
- g@@ wang so@@ o . - yes , hy@@ ung .
why didn 't you block her ? even if i had blo@@ cked her , you 'd still have gotten sl@@ apped .
so un@@ lucky !
to be honest , i like represent@@ ative kim .
to be more specif@@ ic , we used to be in love with each other .
and now , we 're trying to get back together .
i 'm hoping that you , writ@@ er lee , could help us with that .
once you get to know him , represent@@ ative kim is quite a catch .
yes ?
where are you ?
why ?
what do you mean " why " ?
did you forget ?
what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
you said you were going to re-@@ sign your contr@@ act .
that 's why you 're calling right now ?
is there anything to talk about besides that ?
looks l@@ ire you 're at your studio , so i 'll head that way .
no , don 't come .
what ?
i said don 't come , since i 'm going out now .
where are you going ?
do i have to report that to you too ?
mom !
you 're here !
he 's been waiting !
why are you so late ?
i heard that you 're going to sign a contr@@ act for 100 episodes .
he 's also prom@@ ising a lot of money !
well , i 'll leave you two to talk .
i 'll run some er@@ rand@@ s next door .
how did you know to come here ?
besides the writ@@ er 's room , do you have anywhere else to go but here ?
okay , let 's make this contr@@ act , writ@@ er lee .
i 'll do it later .
what ?
did that ss@@ d production company or whatever contact you again ?
par@@ don ?
how much ?
how much did they offer you ?
do you think i 'm doing this because of money ?
then what is it ?
don 't forget how much i had to suff@@ er in that bitter cold because of you .
no ... i - i need to read and review the contr@@ act , don 't i ?
what now ?
you can 't take your word back , alright ?
alright , i got it !
lee go e@@ un .
yes ?
don 't let me wait too long . hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , wake up .
wake up !
what is it ?
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other ]
g@@ wang so@@ o , how did this happen ?
i guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have in@@ formed the repor@@ ters .
what day ?
the day when you got sl@@ apped by miss yo@@ on bit na .
i 'm done with you now !
have it your way with the shooting sno@@ g@@ ging that o@@ h-@@ so-@@ bel@@ o@@ ved sung min ah !
oh my mother , father ... un@@ ni , does this even make sense ?
min ah , you should calm down first . calm down , calm down .
i think k@@ ang hy@@ un min released these articles on purpose .
he did it because i wasn 't accep@@ ting his heart .
would he go that far ?
of course !
a mor@@ on like him would easily do this !
un@@ ni , you have no idea how much he is into me right now .
really ?
that bad ?
what the he@@ ck is represent@@ ative oh doing , letting these kind of re@@ ports get publ@@ ished ?
i know , right ?
really !
represent@@ ative , miss sung min ah is in a scand@@ al in the re@@ ports !
what ?
with whom ?
well , it 's ...
is it anthony ?
what the he@@ ck is this ? what the he@@ ck is this ?
the report on miss sung min ah 's scand@@ al .
what the he@@ ck ?
since when did they get so close ?
no wonder ...
i knew it the moment yo@@ on bit na of angels sl@@ apped him .
what ?
sl@@ apped him ?
what happened ?
come on , sp@@ ill it !
we have no time to lose ! well , you should take a look at this .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other according to a mik staff ]
represent@@ ative , were you aware of it , too ?
what would you like to have ?
hot jama@@ ic@@ an blue with extra shot .
es@@ pres@@ so .
okay .
what the he@@ ck are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
i know very well that you released those re@@ ports !
what !
?
take those re@@ ports off while i 'm still being civil .
have you lost your mind ?
( in@@ formal@@ ly )
what ! ?
what did you say just now ?
( in@@ formal@@ ly )
you ?
yes , you !
listen carefully . i don 't know exactly how much you like me but i don 't have the s@@ ligh@@ test interest in you so direct your interest el@@ se@@ where and get rid of the articles instantly .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah , you both look so great together .
i wish you to continue loving each other in a bas@@ hing manner , fighting .
why are you sitting here ?
oh my jesus .. oh my jesus ..
have you read that scand@@ al news about k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah ?
that 's very good .
par@@ don ?
people will now watch the drama with more interest@@ s .
it will help the rat@@ ing , don 't you think so ?
" children of paradise , " i think i told you to end it earlier than its original plan . well , that 's ...
in case of " children of paradise , " both the production company and its ac@@ tors are so determined to work for it until the end .
more@@ over , if it ends earlier , the next drama 's first air@@ date should be moved up , but its production company is compl@@ aining a lot because they 're not ready yet .
production company , production company , production company !
what can you do if you keep kissing the as@@ ses of production compan@@ ies !
?
we , who are on top of the heads of such mere production compan@@ ies , are the " a " ! " a " ! if we 're the " a , " then we should show what " a " is supposed to be !
yes , that 's right . sched@@ ul@@ ing the dram@@ as is the own right of us , the broadcasting station , but at the same time , it 's the promise with vie@@ wers .
should we change that preci@@ ous promise with vie@@ wers just because the rat@@ ing is bad , or because its commercial value is bad or not , as if we turn our palm over ? well , as far as i know , you sub@@ mit@@ ted your re@@ sign@@ ation and left our company , so do you think you have the right to come here ?
yes , i just met president .
as of 5 pm , today , i 'm appro@@ ved to come back as director of drama department .
deput@@ y director .
thank you for your work . first , for leaving my position because of my personal reason ,
i 'm sin@@ cer@@ ely sorry .
then , before starting the meeting , let me tell you one thing . that 's right , as our deput@@ y director kim said , we 're the " a. "
but i would appreciate if you remember this point as well .
justice without power is really hel@@ pl@@ ess and vain .
but power without justice is just violence .
now , the era of violence must be ended .
the era of violence must not be repeated .
well , then shall we begin the meeting ?
yes , speaking .
oh , represent@@ ative kim .
i heard there was some hic@@ cup on the shooting sched@@ ule because of the fire accident . i heard there was some hic@@ cup on the shooting sched@@ ule because of the fire accident .
wouldn 't there be any problem for our air sched@@ ule ?
i don 't think it 's something a jo@@ bl@@ ess person has to concern . listen well ,
i 'm talking to you now as director of drama department .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand , director . everything will go well without any issue .
okay , i will rely on you , represent@@ ative kim .
i heard you 're rein@@ stat@@ ed .
yes .
as you see .
what is the reason you changed your mind ?
well , if you hear that , you will be disap@@ pointed .
well , there is nothing more to be disap@@ pointed about .
yes . this position , that 's right , not by my compet@@ ence but by your power , father , by un@@ just meth@@ od , it 's given to me .
even if i didn 't know that , it 's also my fault .
but , just quit@@ ting isn 't sol@@ ving everything , and i should do my best in this very position to not let this drama field rot , to not let this drama go back to the past dirty way .
i thought that is very important .
well , times have changed , i guess .
i will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change .
represent@@ ative ...
what ?
let 's think about warm things .
for me , it 's bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
the first thing coming in your mind is that che@@ ap bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o ?
what 's wrong with bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
if you 're not careful enough , your mouth will get bur@@ nt .
you have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot .
miss , would you like a sweet po@@ tat@@ o ?
no thank you , i 'm fine .
please keep s@@ elling many .
no . no , lee go e@@ un .
don 't think us@@ eless thoughts .
concentr@@ ate on the script .
concentr@@ ate for the waiting vie@@ wers of your drama .
okay , you can do it ! aja aja ! lee go e@@ un , fighting !
who is it ?
it 's me .
what are you doing , not opening the door ?
what 's the matter ?
have you made a decision ?
what decision ?
ren@@ e@@ wing the contr@@ act .
is that why you came ?
no .
because of this . no . because of this .
you said you wanted to eat ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shi@@ vering that you wanted to eat sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
i remember .
don 't mis@@ understand .
i didn 't do this because of the contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al and i didn 't do it for some other ul@@ ter@@ ior motive either .
honestly , i just bought them when i saw the street ven@@ dor s@@ elling them nearby , so just enjoy .
eat it before it gets cold . i 'm leaving .
i don 't even believe in myself sometimes but i believe in you .
you 're not ... crying , right ?
no , the two of us , we used to love each other , and now , we 're thinking of working it out .
because of this .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shi@@ vering that you wanted to eat sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
what ?
do they taste bad ?
why do you conf@@ use people ?
what ?
you 're dating sung min ah , why are you being like this to me ?
dating sung min ah ?
who ?
what do you mean , " who " ?
you are .
why would that person give me sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
who said i was dating sung min ah ?
eh ?
i don 't know where you heard that strange ru@@ mor no , i guess you 're saying that because you saw me with sung min ah here before .
i don 't have such feelings for wh@@ om@@ ever , so you don 't have to be concerned .
well , it 's not that i 'm concern about that but ...
that is ... and , if somebody bu@@ ys you sweet po@@ tat@@ o , are you always confused ?
what are you confused about ?
no ...
well , this ... if this is from china or from domest@@ ic ... i was confused ...
that is ... do you by chance like me ?
then again , that would never happen .
represent@@ ative .
what ?
episode 15 we have crossed the r@@ ubic@@ on do you like me by any chance ? but then , there is no way you would .
represent@@ ative . what ? n-@@ -@@ no , it 's nothing .
so silly . right ! i like you !
i said i like you .
i must be crazy , i 'm crazy .
i 'm not in my right mind .
i like you !
i said i like you .
hy@@ ung , what are you waiting for ?
just tell her like a man !
easier said than done .
i just can 't work up the courage .
that 's why you need to get brave .
just make up your mind and walk up to her ...
walk up to what ?
you have arrived .
pd jo@@ o , what is it ?
something wrong ?
no , nothing .
actually , jo@@ o pd ...
sp@@ ill it , go@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae .
what is it ? pd jo@@ o fell in love .
what ?
love ?
yes . the moment he saw the young@@ est f@@ d of the direc@@ ting team , he fell for her .
jo@@ o pd .
yes .
are you in your right mind ?
eh ?
do you think i pay you just so you could chase ch@@ icks at the film@@ ing site ?
what kind of a production pd doesn 't separ@@ ate his private life from his work ?
tell me .
are you really dating k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
i don 't know about it .
if you really want to know , you could go ask that mor@@ on yourself .
i need to go for more shooting . min ah , either anthony or k@@ ang hy@@ un min , the way i see it , your taste in men is really low .
what ?
you know it . our hy@@ un min is so gentle and consider@@ ate , which could cause such rum@@ ors with miss sung min ah , but ... hy@@ ung , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
represent@@ ative choi ! red long john@@ s , red pants !
what '@@ cha do@@ in ' ?
- just shut up already !
ah , at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
yes , then , i 'm hanging up .
i was just expl@@ aining to the reporter about your ru@@ mor !
ah , you were being inter@@ vie@@ wed ?
yes . you should have said so then .
hy@@ ung !
how can you hang up so ru@@ de@@ ly when it was such an important call ?
they 're only going to get more susp@@ icious !
what exactly do you do for me as my represent@@ ative ?
do you even know that my kore@@ an be@@ ef en@@ dor@@ sement contr@@ act is about to exp@@ ire ?
don 't worry , they 're coming this afternoon .
really ?
i 'm warning you .
stop staring at me .
i 'm out of your league , so give up and just concentr@@ ate on your drama .
ah well , with your un@@ requ@@ ited love and en@@ dor@@ sements ... you 're bus@@ ider than a bee , no wonder you 'd forget about the drama .
what ?
un@@ requ@@ ited love ?
bus@@ ier than a bee ?
hy@@ ung !
is there a bee farm around here ?
why did it fa@@ il ?
hey ! isn 't " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " a total hit ?
i know !
hy@@ un min op@@ pa is so amazing in that one !
but , i 'm not sure about the recent episodes .
why ?
think about it . jin h@@ ye rin told kim wo@@ o jin that she loves him and whatever .
they even kissed !
and now she 's going to betr@@ ay him ?
what 's up with that ?
that 's true .
that doesn 't make sense .
ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es , chip@@ s , ram@@ y@@ un ...
such a chil@@ dish ap@@ petite you have .
don 't you care about staying in shape ?
are you listening to me ?
yes .
your mother is at your studio , so get going .
mom ?
it 's del@@ icious .
aig@@ oo , it already started !
you 're watching it again ?
of course ! i 'm watching all the r@@ er@@ uns , too .
is it that fun ?
of course .
whose daughter wrote it , after all ?
gos@@ h , why is he like that again ?
go e@@ un ... that jin h@@ ye rin , is she betr@@ aying kim wo@@ o jin after all ?
no .
actually , this will be reve@@ aled much later , but she 's not really betr@@ aying him .
she 's preten@@ ding to betr@@ ay him because there 's no other way , but she 's really helping kim wo@@ o jin .
oh , it was like that ?
had i known that , i wouldn 't have been cur@@ sing her .
my daughter is amazing !
you are a gen@@ ius , gen@@ ius !
it 's starting .
now , let 's hear from mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's management staff . as you know , our hy@@ un min is so gentle and consider@@ ate , that it causes such mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings ... but at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
why , what are you doing ?
represent@@ ative choi ! - just shut up already !
your voice came out also .
how embarras@@ sing ...
like this , the management is den@@ ying the ru@@ mor , but re@@ ports of wit@@ nes@@ ses who saw the two ac@@ tors dating at a cafe or at the film@@ ing studio keep sur@@ facing , prom@@ p@@ ting the possibil@@ ity of another celebr@@ ity couple being in the making , which is a hot po@@ tat@@ o in the world of entertainment gos@@ sip cur@@ r@@ ently .
ah , seriously !
celebr@@ ity couple in the making ?
i told them no ! why don 't they believe me ?
! that 's why you should have been more firm !
my cf , my money is here !
i 've been really enjoying " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " lat@@ ely . ah , speaking of which ,
how about doing it with miss sung min ah this time as a couple ?
jud@@ ging from the drama , the two of you really look great and work well together .
i 've been doing this by myself for 3 years , why would i do it with sung min ah now ?
well , it is the wish of the spon@@ sor .
send the spon@@ sor my message clearly : either i , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , do it by myself ,
he will never be able to do it with someone else .
i won 't do it !
oh , you know , right ?
that scand@@ al ... is total non@@ sense .
of course , i know it better than any@@ body .
did you want to see me to talk about that ?
no . there is someone i 'd like you to meet .
ah , there he comes .
say hello to the chief director of ta@@ es@@ an group , kim sang j@@ ik .
i 'm anthony kim .
nice to meet you .
a production company ?
yes .
our company is going to cre@@ ate the larg@@ est production company in asia .
we would like you to be the ceo of that company .
we 'll offer you the high@@ est sal@@ ary in the industry as well as 10 % of the shar@@ es .
what do you think ? although , right now , you are the represent@@ ative of a small production company , for someone who had once created the legend of empire , this is a mat@@ ching offer , i think .
i 'm sorry , but i will dec@@ line .
why ?
are you passing up this excep@@ tional offer ? of course , it is an attr@@ active offer , but however , i don 't want to work under other people any more .
in thinking about our entertainment group , it 's not only into drama but inclu@@ des management .
this first management contr@@ act will be with sung min ah .
if you confir@@ m , then we will move immediately .
it 's here .
you said that you wanted to make the world 's best production , right ?
why don 't you make it , starting from here ?
every year , i will inv@@ est $ 40 million into world production .
of course , the ow@@ ner will be anthony kim .
as long as we get 49 % of the shar@@ es .
what do you think ? this offer ?
exactly what is the reason you are off@@ ering me this deal ? it 's because cre@@ ating a company which ex@@ ce@@ eds empire is our go@@ al . also , the person who created the empire 's my@@ th is you , anthony , is it not ?
i will accept . you have made the right decision !
we will complete the oper@@ ating details and
i will take it as a confir@@ med contr@@ act .
then ...
you are finally able to ach@@ ie@@ ve your dream . watching you succe@@ ed , while watching you , is also the dream that i hoped for .
♫ because your two eyes are far away , i only see you .
♫ because my heart is frozen , i 'm hug@@ ging you . ♫ when your trembling lips touch my ears , ♫ while i dre@@ amed only of you to say the words i love you .
the person who created empire 's my@@ th is exactly you , anthony , is it not ?
you said that you wanted to make asia 's best production did you not ?
why don 't you go ahead and try making it ?
of course , the ow@@ ner is you , anthony kim .
that 's right .
the time has come .
bong dal represent@@ ative , it 's me .
i 'm in the middle of a meeting . i 'm busy , so hang up .
from this moment on , i will start my own drama again .
i think i said that i was in the middle of a meeting .
i 'm busy , so hang up .
if you hang up this time , i 'm not going to leave you be .
what are taking my word for ?
i 'm busy right now but because of you ....
you said you were a busy person .
you said you were in the middle of a meeting .
exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck ?
until a few moments ago , i was busy with the meeting .
but what are you trying to say ?
by tomorrow morning , please ga@@ ther the " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's " crew .
ga@@ ther ?
it 's something more important than anything .
understand ?
so , you 're going to fix the up@@ lo@@ aded episodes 11 and 12 ?
yes , i wanted to show more of the love between the two charac@@ ters .
up to now , only in episode 13 , it is realized that h@@ ye rin came to help wo@@ o jin .
and then , it was my idea that h@@ ye rin 's character would be seen as nearly sin@@ ister .
because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice .
so you will modi@@ fy episode 11 by acceler@@ ating the content of episode 13 ?
yes . with that change , i think it will be possible to see the audience ro@@ oting for the two charac@@ ters .
but , can you am@@ end the scre@@ en@@ play in less than four days ?
i can do it .
it 's not something to be de@@ alt with by talking . you have a point there to put the story together , but it 's a big risk .
if that is to happen , we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before .
hy@@ un min , what do you think ?
huh ?
do it like that .
she says she can do it , so why don 't we try belie@@ ving writ@@ er lee ?
is it not un@@ imag@@ ine@@ able , too difficult and are there problems every day ?
can you really do the script in four days ?
yes . i can do it .
fine . if writ@@ er lee says she can do it , then i will wait .
then , take care of yourself .
let 's see how well you can do .
bye .
the writ@@ er says she can do it , so why don 't we trust her once ?
i mean , that 's living .
that fox !
we 're in a state of emergen@@ cy now .
i know . even if you manage to re@@ write the script for 2 episodes , what comes after that is the problem .
for the following episodes , even if there is a problem in the script , we still have to shoot it without changing a thing .
i 'm fully aware of it .
you have to keep this in mind , that the decision you just made , put " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " on a path of no return .
like julius caesar who mar@@ ched toward rome in b.@@ c. 49 , we have crossed the r@@ ubic@@ on river .
let them find out at this point ... and make a powerful ending ...
it 's un@@ locked . since we 're in a state of emergen@@ cy , we have to save the time for sleep as well as food .
natur@@ ally , until you 're done with the revision , you can 't leave the studio .
so , what are all these ? multi@@ vit@@ am@@ ins , red gin@@ sen@@ g extr@@ act , om@@ eg@@ a-@@ 3 for im@@ pro@@ ving circulation , and this is yo@@ gur@@ t , good for const@@ ip@@ ation .
if you 're sitting in one place too long , you get const@@ ip@@ ated .
since your physical health is top prior@@ ity , make sure to take them .
and what is that ? to@@ oth@@ pa@@ ste , sham@@ po@@ o , and lo@@ tion .
also , since i don 't know what you use , i just bought one of each kind .
why , you don 't use the ones with wings ?
i bought them because they cost 1500 won more .
you 're a man , represent@@ ative .
isn 't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman ?
i 'm not a man , but a produc@@ er . you 're not a woman , but a writ@@ er .
i 'll put these away and sit here , so call me if you need anything .
what ?
you 're not leaving ?
why would i leave ?
you 're not writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un .
what , are you sle@@ ep@@ y already ?
no , nothing .
yes , i understand .
then , we will meet next week and discus@@ s .
make an ap@@ pointment with the production company , please .
yes , yes , good work .
by the way , director ...
there 's barely enough time for shooting , how can they rev@@ ise the script now ? how about this , hir@@ ing a more experienced writ@@ er to help writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ...
why don 't we trust writ@@ er lee go e@@ un and wait ? seriously , director , she 's a ro@@ o@@ kie , how can we just trust and wait ?
why , didn 't you call her another writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un ?
well , that ..
after continu@@ ing 10 more years ..
listen , director lee ...
eh ?
just ... just , just ...
uh , director .
director ...
what do we do hy@@ un min ?
why ? what 's the problem ?
i just heard from the kore@@ an be@@ ef commercial .
t@@ the spon@@ sor says , if you don 't do it with sung min ah , he 'd choose another couple .
what ?
!
like who ? i guess they 're trying to contact j@@ ang dong gun and go so young .
j@@ ang dong gun and go so young ?
( a married couple of super@@ stars )
miss sung min ah ...
i think i warned you , not to stare at me .
let 's talk for a moment .
i don 't have anything to talk about with you .
it 's only for a moment .
it 's a very important thing .
so , let me get this straight .
you want us to be in a kore@@ an be@@ ef commercial as a couple ?
i 'm not interested . look for someone else .
don 't take this wrong .
i don 't want to be in a commercial with you , miss sung min ah .
then why are you asking to do it together ?
well , you could call it the respon@@ sibil@@ ity of the leading actor ...
besides , why are you so sel@@ fish , miss sung min ah ?
what ?
when writ@@ er lee is working so hard , are you just going to sit there and do nothing ?
when we do a commercial as a couple , it will also promo@@ te more a@@ waren@@ ess of our drama ... stop that non@@ sense , and tell me the real reason .
ah man , really ...
money .
can 't you just do it this once ?
i 'll do anything you ask .
fine , but i have one condition .
do a tv interview in person , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , that we 're not in a relationship .
also , release news re@@ ports to clar@@ if@@ y the rum@@ ors .
just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us .
can you promise to do that ?
deal .
then , me too .
deal !
do you think this makes sense ?
why doesn 't it ?
kim wo@@ o jin gives up his li@@ fel@@ ong dream and goes to res@@ cue jin h@@ ye rin ?
what a non@@ sense !
he loves her that much ! of course he 'd rush to save jin h@@ ye rin , leaving everything behind .
what idiot gives up his dream for love ?
how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ? how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ? how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ?
if he loves her to death , why wouldn 't he ? in case you haven 't noticed , humans are in@@ nat@@ ely sel@@ fish .
in case you haven 't noticed , humans are in@@ nat@@ ely sel@@ fish .
they cry when they 're hungry , and they smile when they 're full .
have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ?
how can you not understand this ?
un@@ like your element@@ ary un@@ requ@@ ited crus@@ hes , i have had lots of experience .
how many ? like what ?
kissing and sleeping together .
you mean , doing those is love ?
what else is there to it ?
uh , so low !
yes , i 'm a thir@@ d-@@ rate low@@ life .
but you don 't even have that experience .
ah , whatever .
i got it . let 's stop this conversation now .
i 'll just write the script . i 'll just write the script .
sure , you write the script .
i 'll make a trip to the office .
you still seem to think that you 're right .
but admit it , you 're wrong .
just go already !
your son looks really amazing .
produc@@ ing a great drama like that .
you must be really proud of him .
he should find a good woman before i pass on .
he 's not married yet ?
i even wonder if he ever liked someone ?
because of the hard@@ ships he had to en@@ dure , he only knows to pretend to be strong .
he doesn 't know how to open up his heart to someone .
i see .
if he had been born to good parents , he could have had a happy life ... what are you doing , not writing the script ?
it 's a movie i must watch for the script .
love letter ?
yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
why would you watch it again then ?
well , to get into the emo@@ tional mood , i have to watch it even for 10@@ 1@@ st time !
it 's all because you 've never been in love that you 're watching something like this .
stop nag@@ ging like that .
i 'm going to watch it anyway .
are you doing well ?
i 'm doing fine !
you 're supposed to make others cry , not cry yourself .
are you doing well ?
( in japan@@ ese ) are you doing well ?
is that sad ?
please stop crying so ugly .
you 're distur@@ bing the person next to you .
it 's sad but really beautiful , right ?
no ?
eh ?
about what ? after a long time has passed , she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book .
even the title of the book is " in search of lost time . "
i read that book so many times even ...
i mean it . you were never in true love , represent@@ ative .
have you ever even shed tears for love ? because my eyes are blin@@ ded , all i can see is you because my heart is frozen , i wrap my arms around you when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , my heart , that had been dre@@ aming of only you ...
because my eyes are blin@@ ded , all i see is you , because my heart is frozen ,
i wrap my arms around you .
when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , anthony , are you crazy ?
this is non@@ sense .
how can that tom@@ boy look so pretty in my eyes ?
are the ter@@ ms of the contr@@ act ok ?
- both k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah agree ... so i don 't think it 'll be a problem .
don 't we need to hear what writ@@ er lee go e@@ un thinks ?
shall we call her ?
well then , represent@@ ative ...
um , represent@@ ative ?
huh ?
oh , what did you say ?
ah , so cold .
it 's too cold !
it wak@@ es me right up !
seriously .
it 's cold !
yes , chief director .
i 'm calling because the cha@@ ir@@ man would like to meet you in person and discus@@ s the contr@@ act .
how about friday evening ?
that 's fine . i 'll see you then .
alright , we 'll decide on the time and place and contact you again .
yes , good bye .
the door is open , what are ... wait , why am i doing this ?
stop this , anthony . i 'm a produc@@ er , and she 's a writ@@ er .
i guess the others haven 't come in yet ?
why ?
here 's the revis@@ ed draft of the script .
what do you think ?
it 's good .
well done .
cut !
ok !
the revis@@ ed draft makes it so much easier to em@@ path@@ ize !
the starting point isn 't too bad . pd jo@@ o , what are you doing ? !
what is the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing for today ?
19.@@ 8 % .
it went up 2.1 % from the day before !
yeah !
ah , good job everyone .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " so@@ ars even higher as the truth behind jin h@@ ye rin 's betr@@ ay@@ al is reve@@ aled
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " lead@@ s the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing for 6 weeks in a row , going over 20 %
as the romance of k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah dev@@ el@@ op , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ke@@ eps its lead .
lat@@ ely , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing has been so@@ aring up impres@@ si@@ vely .
well , i don 't concern myself too much over the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings .
the only thing that i 'm interested in is the love from you .
actually , there is a ru@@ mor that all your attention is focused on a specif@@ ic person , causing the numer@@ ous fans of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min to watch " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " in je@@ alo@@ us@@ y .
today , we 'd like to hear the truth .
the ru@@ mor with miss sung min ah , is it really just a ru@@ mor ?
today , until you give us an answer about the ru@@ mor , i won 't let you go .
ah , just answer him , you mor@@ on !
miss sung min ah , right .
she 's a great act@@ ress .
she 's a good actor and a good person . i can swear over my family , sad@@ ly , it is only a ru@@ mor .

i must keep for sure .

take care of your husband 's physical health with kore@@ an be@@ ef .
kore@@ an be@@ ef !
i just vis@@ ited ho@@ eng@@ se@@ ong rec@@ ently .
[ ho@@ eng@@ se@@ ong : famous town for kore@@ an be@@ ef ]
i count on you to promo@@ te more a@@ waren@@ ess about kore@@ an be@@ ef .
what 's with that face ?
you got money and kore@@ an be@@ ef !
isn 't this aw@@ esome ?
ah , what a pa@@ the@@ tic bu@@ m .
pa@@ the@@ tic bu@@ m ?
do you think i 'm just doing this for the money ? even anthony and writ@@ er lee , for the drama , are working on the script together .
then we , also for the drama , could shoot commerci@@ als and promo@@ te our drama !
they 're working on the script together ?
didn 't you know ? all day long , they 're stuck together like this , working on the script , i think .
i told you not to ski@@ p the sup@@ pl@@ ements .
you caught a cold because you 're not physic@@ ally fit .
thirty minutes after a meal .
i 'll make sure to take them this time .
don 't smile .
you grow on me .
my studio isn 't that far .
i can just walk ...
it 's because i 'm cold .
hello ?
it 's me , min ah .
( wait over there for a moment )
yes .
are you busy ?
well , busy as usual .
then , can you get out for a moment ?
i have something to tell you , and i 'm free this evening .
alright .
alright .
i 'll see you then .
we 're going to re@@ loc@@ ate our office .
the office ?
yes , to a much bigger place .
is it something miss sung min ah helped you with ?
she introduc@@ ed me to a company that wants to inv@@ est in our shar@@ es .
yes . once the contr@@ act goes smooth@@ ly tomorrow , i 'll get you a new studio with a better view , so you can prepare for the next project .
with sung min ah as the lead .
with miss sung min ah as the lead act@@ ress ?
that was their condition .
so stop beating around the bush and putting off your contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al , and let 's ren@@ ew your contr@@ act .
yes .
it couldn 't have been easy for a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er to change the course of the stor@@ y@@ line in the middle .
you must have really helped her a lot , represent@@ ative .
of course . she couldn 't have come this far without my help .
speaking of which , i 'd like to let lee go e@@ un write our next project , too .
what do you think ?
well , if the script is good , i have nothing against it .
sure .
ah , you know what 's tomorrow , right ?
the contr@@ act with the cha@@ ir@@ man of ta@@ es@@ an group .
yes , at 6@@ pm in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong , i heard .
since you 'll meet him for the first time , it would be good to talk over dinner .
so i asked them to meet there .
you used to like the restaur@@ ants there . also , tomorrow , i 'll also expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me you forgot ?
can you tell me that you don 't have any feelings for me ?
then , stop telling me to forget .
once we start again , there won 't be any reason for us to break up ever again .
min ah , i 'll wait .
also , tomorrow , i 'll expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me , you forgot .
your vision got blur@@ ry all of a sudden , and you felt diz@@ zy ?
yes .
did you have a lot of stress lat@@ ely , or did you over@@ work yourself ?
what man in korea doesn 't live like that ?
then , are you taking any drug@@ s for long term ?
i 've been taking an anti@@ depres@@ sant for about 3 years now .
three years ... then , have you had these symp@@ tom@@ s before that ? no , it never happened before , only rec@@ ently , about twice .
we 'll know more after you get a thor@@ ough physical ex@@ am and get the resul@@ ts back .
at this point , it seems like a side effect of the anti@@ depres@@ sant .
cut !
okay !
we 'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes !
g@@ wang so@@ o , phone .
g@@ wang so@@ o ? so , over that pretty faced f@@ d ch@@ ick , the two of you are having a mental race ?
yes . g@@ wang so@@ o , in order to capture the heart of a lady ; first , you have to show her your own sexy smile often .
smile .
smile .
director ? look at sung min ah , she 's so stun@@ ned .
but if i keep sending her the same smile over and over , som@@ ed@@ ay she 'll ask .
ask what ?
why do you smile like that whenever you see me ?
and then ?
then , you need to say an imp@@ act@@ ful , short , and conc@@ ise phrase that will se@@ du@@ ce her .
your eyes make me smile .
ew@@ w , it 's so che@@ es@@ y !
i feel n@@ aus@@ e@@ ous .
did you take your pil@@ ls ?
you 're here ?
i said did you take your medicine ?
yes .

what about the contr@@ act ?
hurry up and go .
did you forget who was here today ?
how could you throw away such an important contr@@ act ?
i 'm sorry
there was a situation .
what situation ?
what problem is greater than your dream , your future ?
was writ@@ er lee go e@@ un such an important person to you ?
why can 't you answer ?
is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un so important to you ?
that 's right .
lee go e@@ un is an important person to me .
i finally realized it .
that lee go e@@ un ... is such an important person to me .
[ pre@@ view ] about when kim wo@@ o jin goes to save jin h@@ ye rin ...
i think you 're right .
you have a guy , don 't you ?
is it kim bong dal ?
if you bother writ@@ er lee one more time , i swear to god .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is all over the place .
i only saw his foot acting .
am i that bad at acting ?
do you honestly think my acting is that bad ?
have you ever put effort into acting ?
what are you doing tonight ?
we have to sign a contr@@ act .
why are we writing a contr@@ act on christmas eve ?
... but why does my vision get clo@@ ud@@ y at times ?
how would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound ?
episode 16 in search of lost time i 'm sorry . something came up .
what came up ? what can possibly be more important than your dream and your future ? is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un that important to you ?
why aren 't you ans@@ wering ? i asked if writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is that important to you . that 's right .
lee go e@@ un is a very important person to me .
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go e@@ un .
how dear she is to me .
i 'm sorry .
excuse me , the person that was here , where did she go ?
ah , she was d@@ isch@@ arg@@ ed earlier .
lee go e@@ un ! lee go e@@ un , s@@ nap out of it !

i heard from miss sung min ah .
the cha@@ ir@@ man is also im@@ pressed by your devo@@ ted care of your writ@@ er , and does not want to miss the opportunity of working with you .
we 'll make another ap@@ pointment soon for the contr@@ act .
thank you ! bye !

[ a k ]

connec@@ ting to the vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail ...
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go e@@ un .
how dear she is to me .
good news !
another commercial offer .
this time , it 's for a pain@@ killer .
miss sung min ah is in ag@@ ony because of a bad head@@ ache , and tada ~ i appear to hand you the pil@@ ls .
listen carefully ...
from now on until i die , i won 't ever do another commercial with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
got it ?
what 's up with her ?
does she not like it because it 's pain@@ kil@@ lers ?
i like it .
" mel@@ ta@@ way q ! "
thank you .
thanks to you , the contr@@ act will be fine .
good for you .
also ... your feelings for writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i understand . working together for some time can bring the two of you closer , and you can grow on each other .
however , even after the drama is over , will your feelings stay the same ?
i won 't be im@@ patient .
when the time comes , i 'll be able to hear the answer .
are you sure you were sick ?
yes . i was really , really sick .
did you see a doctor ?
of course i did !
aig@@ oo , if you were that sick , you should have called me .
how could you go see a doctor by yourself ?
no , i didn 't go alone .
with whom ?
well , with ... a person ?
a person ?
who exactly ?
ah , mom , i 'm eating !
you ... have a man , right ?
no !
lee go e@@ un got a man !
who is it ?
who ?
is it that kim bong dal guy ?
oh , no !
my tum@@ my might get upset !
aren 't you writ@@ er lee 's mother ?
omo , if it isn 't the represent@@ ative !
where are you going ?
i fixed some food for go e@@ un , and now i 'm on my way home .
i 'll give you a ride then .
get in .
no , well , you don 't have to .
the day is too cold for you to walk .
please get in .
have you been doing well lat@@ ely ?
what is there to do well ?
just being busy with my li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood , not even notic@@ ing my own daughter getting sick .
but , by any chance , represent@@ ative , do you know kim bong dal ?
kim bong dal ?
yes .
but why are you curious about that person ? well , it seems like my go e@@ un is interested in him , but she wouldn 't tell me anything .
but , represent@@ ative , is it a person you know ? well , yes , i never got to meet him in person , but i heard that he has a good reputation and his future seems bright .
according to what i 've heard , he even has good looks .
then , take care .
when you 're not too busy , come in for a meal .
yes .
thanks for the ride .
then , you should get back .
no , i 'll see you get in first and then take off .
ah , don 't worry about me and just get back .
then , i 'll see you again later .
aig@@ oo , did he take something wrong ?
where did his mann@@ ers come from ?
that 's so not like him at all !
i think the grand prize for best actor should go to shin ha g@@ yo@@ on . his acting was good , and , more import@@ antly , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings were excellent .
in ter@@ ms of vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a good conten@@ der , too .
though his acting is nothing out of the ordin@@ ary , but he 's sched@@ ul@@ ed for another s@@ bc drama next year .
the grand prize for best actor should go to a good actor .
yes , i understand both of your positions , but how about j@@ ang jo@@ o sung ?
what , j@@ ang jo@@ o sung ?
yes . yes , well , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings were low , but just looking at acting alone , he was the best this year .
listen , m broadcasting is giving it to cha se@@ ung won , and k broadcasting is giving it to park shin yang .
yet , we 're going to give it to an ob@@ sc@@ ure , aged actor ?
it 's the grand prize after all , it should go to a star with some clo@@ ut . it 's not an award of appreci@@ ation .
it 's not an award of appreci@@ ation .
yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. j@@ ang to rece@@ ive it ? yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. j@@ ang to rece@@ ive it ?
it liter@@ ally is the grand prize for best actor .
reg@@ ard@@ less of star@@ ship or vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing , but sol@@ ely looking at the acting performance , right ? well , director , let 's take things with a gr@@ ain of salt .
the a@@ war@@ ding cerem@@ ony for the grand prize is another tv show .
it is another competition for vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings .
besides , we have to discus@@ s this matter with the vari@@ ety department as they 're prepar@@ ing the cerem@@ ony .
so , director nam , you should pay attention to our opin@@ ions , too , this time .
yes , i understand .
then , we shall continue this discus@@ sion in our next meeting .
i 'll come back again .
take care of yourself .
cut !
ok !
now , let 's eat before going to the next scene !
then , we 'll res@@ ume shooting in an hour .
have a good meal !
does a top star have to eat at such an open place ?
there are no good restaur@@ ants around here .
have you watched " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " this week ?
of course .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min was practically flying in his action scenes .
all i could see of k@@ ang hy@@ un min was his suc@@ ky acting .
that 's true .
my eyes are all for min ah no@@ ona .
how could you even notice k@@ ang hy@@ un min ? hey , isn 't that k@@ ang hy@@ un min over there ?
over there .
he is !
he 's good looking .
he does look super@@ b . for real !
don 't miss your classes .
only k@@ ang hy@@ un min . um , hy@@ ung , is sung min ah even pret@@ tier than on screen ?
yes .
mak@@ e-@@ up does wonder@@ s .
what ?
it 's sung min ah .
w@@ hoa !
sung min ah !
hy@@ ung , do it quick , hurry !
sung min ah is leaving !
i 'd like to get an auto@@ graph , too .
ah , yes .
by the way , what is your name , young man ?
brad pit@@ t .
alright , one person at a time .
what is your name ?
- park sung ho@@ on !
g@@ wang so@@ o ?
from now on , we should always eat in front of an all-@@ girls high@@ school .
i was thinking of prepar@@ ing red gin@@ sen@@ g as presents for the broadcasting compan@@ ies for this season .
what ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g my bu@@ m .
that doesn 't suit the scale of the empire .
prepare impor@@ ted wine . top not@@ ch grade .
yes . understood .
what ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g ?
present red gin@@ sen@@ g to the broadcasting compan@@ ies with se@@ as@@ onal gre@@ et@@ ings ?
yes , i think that would be appropri@@ ate .
are you in your right mind ?
we don 't have money for that !
you may leave .
yes . ah , pd jo@@ o ,
yes .
bring me the c@@ vs of the writ@@ ers with whom we have contr@@ acts .
our ... writ@@ ers ?
the only writ@@ er that has a contr@@ act with us is just writ@@ er lee .
yes , bring hers .
why do you want her cv all of a sudden ?
do i have to explain that to you ?
no .
sorry , i was too busy .
i sin@@ cer@@ ely apologi@@ ze .
but i don 't think i can come to the christmas reunion this year , either , because i have to work on my script .
i guess you guys will have fun without me . yes , but instead ,
i 'll treat you gener@@ ously next year after the drama is done .
alright .
see you next year .
yes .
her hob@@ by is to watch movies , speci@@ al@@ ty is ta@@ e ... official 4@@ th de@@ gree black belt in ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do ... favorite food is gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els and ... ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
favorite movie is love letter . love letter ... yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
it 's really sad , but really beautiful at the same time .
don 't you agree ?
are you fine ?
( in japan@@ ese )
i 'm fine .
man , that scared me .
what a shock .
don 't you know how to knock ?
i did knock , but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered .
at any rate , why have you come here ?
to get some prin@@ ter paper .
what were you watching , anyway ?
none of your concern .
ah , i think i know .
you know what ?
well , what men normally watch .
ste@@ amy stuff .
that 's not it .
i know men watch it quite often .
it 's ok .
i said that 's really not it .
oh , that 's love letter !
yes , it 's love letter !
i thought you didn 't like this movie ?
just to review my japan@@ ese .
that 's all .
but your japan@@ ese is excellent . super@@ b .
to learn the dial@@ ect of ko@@ be . their accent .
my eyes were too busy watching min ah no@@ ona .
how could you even notice k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
hy@@ ung ?
when is the s@@ bc drama awards cerem@@ ony ?
the 3@@ 1@@ st . why ?
let 's see ... possible conten@@ ders for the grand prize of best actor are ... me ... me ...
there 's only me !
no way . there 's shin ha g@@ yo@@ on .
ah , that 's right .
ha g@@ yo@@ on hy@@ ung .
ah , the brain ...
shin ha g@@ yo@@ on of the brain is too strong ...
can 't let that happen .
at this point , i need an imp@@ act@@ ful scene that will set this k@@ ang hy@@ un min apart for sure ! hy@@ ung , you just said that the new script is out , right ? hy@@ ung , when jin h@@ ye rin is ba@@ w@@ ling her eyes out at the end here , what if i did that ?
you ?
the vie@@ wers will be totally aw@@ ed !
hy@@ ung , tell g@@ wang so@@ o to get the car ready .
well , g@@ wang so@@ o has been rather busy lat@@ ely .
what ?
busy ?
the personal assistant is bus@@ ier than the actor ?
well , that 's not what i mean ...
let 's just go the two of us today .
i understand .
however , take the w@@ age for today out of g@@ wang so@@ o 's pay@@ ment for the month .
take it out !
the closer you are , the more cle@@ ar@@ cut you have to be with money .
isn 't that right , bum@@ ble@@ bee ?
you 're going to the military service soon ?
yes , i just got my draft notice .
please take good care of our hy@@ un min hy@@ ung . un@@ like what appe@@ ars on tv , there are many surpris@@ ing things about hy@@ ung .
yes , i heard from represent@@ ative choi that he re@@ qui@@ res a lot of extra care .
actually , hy@@ un min hy@@ ung does not like to read the script .
so , when he 's playing vide@@ og@@ ames , you have to read it out loud to him .
also , when hy@@ ung cho@@ oses a drama , he prefer@@ s melo@@ drama .
it 's because melo@@ dram@@ as bring more commer@@ ical en@@ dor@@ sement off@@ ers for the male lead .
that 's what he belie@@ ves .
the more i think about it , the more it doesn 't make sense .
how can a drama not have the aspect of melo@@ drama ?
g@@ wang so@@ o .
when there is an ap@@ pointment , he makes sure to be later than the other actor . his sense of pride is strong , so he thinks that to wait for someone is to lose .
what ?
sung min ah is very pun@@ ctu@@ al with her sched@@ ule ?
i told you to go slow , g@@ wang so@@ o . last@@ ly , he may say pre@@ poster@@ ous things sometimes , but you should just agree with him .
he may not be that bright , but he 's a good hy@@ ung .
ah , hey ...
jin h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin .
i need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum ...
who is it ?
writ@@ er lee !
writ@@ er lee !
open the door !
open !
mer@@ ry christmas , a present for you .
what is it this time ?
just take it , it 's really just a christmas present , nothing more .
omo ! the size is perfect , and they 're really pretty !
thank you !
now that you received my gift , shall we cut to the chase ?
that 's not possible !
why not ?
this drama is for k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and this k@@ ang hy@@ un min wants to ba@@ wl his eyes out .
kim wo@@ o jin is shot , and jin h@@ ye rin em@@ brac@@ es him and cri@@ es .
yes , but instead of jin h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin can cry !
tears of a man .
how innov@@ ating is that ?
well , i suppose it could be innov@@ ating , but sung min ah is better ...
she is better what ?
ah , well , what i mean is ..
kim wo@@ o jin gets shot in jin h@@ ye rin 's place and is ble@@ eding ...
i don 't know !
i don 't know !
i don 't know about that .
just keep in mind that this is the third time .
third time for me to ask you to change something .
i ended up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean and kissing that sung min ah . human@@ ly speaking , if i scrat@@ ch your back , you should scrat@@ ch my back , too . give and take .
i war@@ n you . if you don 't change it this time , i won 't go easy on you .
i sent off the new script to the prin@@ ting office .
i 'll be stopping at writ@@ er lee 's studio to drop something off before going home .
yes , i see .
wait .
yes ?
i 'll just take it to her . i need to talk with her anyway .
you , represent@@ ative ?
what 's with that look on your face ?
why , is it something heavy ?
hy@@ ung .
i heard about everything .
you 're going to serve in the military ?
yes . i got the draft notice un@@ expec@@ tedly .
i 'm sorry .
i 've come to say my last good bye .
stay in good health , hy@@ ung .
g@@ wang so@@ o .
i bought it myself from the gro@@ cer@@ y store .
hy@@ ung ! hy@@ ung , thank you for everything , in 2 years from now , i 'll be back in better shape .
yes , i 'll be waiting .
take care .
g@@ wang so@@ o !
take good care of yourself !
i mean , does that even make sense ?
he wants to do the crying scene of jin h@@ ye rin ?
at any rate , what should i do ?
he won 't get over it easily this time .
who is it ?
it 's me .
why are you here ?
this .
pd jo@@ o told me to bring it to you .
ah . so you came all the way here just to bring this to me ?
well ... thats right ...
is the script going well ?
yes .
ah , what should i do ?
what ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min came by earlier , and ...
what did hy@@ un min want ?
but , why are you here , represent@@ ative ?
did you see writ@@ er lee go e@@ un earlier today ?
did writ@@ er lee say that ?
she 's such a s@@ nit@@ ch .
well , about that sob@@ bing scene , don 't you think it would be better if kim wo@@ o jin did the crying ?
h@@ mm ...
kim wo@@ o jin crying ?
you sure are professional , understanding my g@@ ist right away . well , at the awards cerem@@ ony at the end of the year ,
ha g@@ yo@@ on hy@@ ung and i are strong candidat@@ es for the grand prize for best actor .
if i were to show an imp@@ act@@ ful scene at this point , i might be able to sec@@ ure the award !
how 's that ? okay , so you want the script to be revis@@ ed so that you 'd do the crying instead ?
exactly that !
do you think you can do that ?
huh ?
you only got this far by pure dum@@ b luck .
with your pa@@ the@@ tic acting skil@@ ls , do you really think you can do that ?
are you done jo@@ king with me ?
no@@ pe , i 've still got a lot more to say .
do you know yourself ? your script analy@@ sis is em@@ el@@ ent@@ ary level , you don 't even know how poor your acting is , you 're the world 's big@@ gest idiot there ever was ! as such , when the script comes out , don 't even change one thing about it , and just read it proper@@ ly !
got it ? but ... i said , do you understand !
what 's up with him ?
why is he like that to me ?
yes , i just saw hy@@ un min .
you saw him ?
what did he say ?
didn 't he throw a fit ?
no@@ pe .
i talked to him with reason , and he accepted it with no problem .
really ?
yes . he 'll do according to the script .
is that true ?
he even said he 's sorry for bo@@ thering you . is that true ? he even said he 's sorry for bo@@ thering you .
that 's a relief .
i mean , you 're really amazing , represent@@ ative .
you took care of it so easily . i was getting a head@@ ache over it .
who am i ?
who else ?
mr. kim bong dal .
anthony .
thank you .
don 't mention it .
if anything ever troubles you , just let me know any time .
you have come .
shall we ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man expec@@ ts a lot from you , mr. anthony .
the preparation for relo@@ cat@@ ing your office will be finished within this month .
ah , miss sung min ah is already here .
oh , i finally get to see you .
i 'm anthony kim .
aig@@ oo , i 've heard a lot about you .
nice to meet you .
please have a seat .
i think i 'll need to take business les@@ sons from you , mr. anthony .
don 't say something like that even as a joke .
i don 't deserve such pr@@ aise .
dram@@ as are made by people , after all .
and you , mr. anthony , know the importance of people .
which makes me very glad to be working with you . well , then ,
i look forward to the business you 'll lead , mr. anthony .
best w@@ ishes .
i don 't know how to express my grat@@ itude to you .
then , instead of saying it to me , show me .
just like you had made the act@@ ress sung min ah into a top star , make your world production into the best company in the world .
i look forward to it .
a new personal assistant ?
yes , my name is an sung mo . you may have heard from g@@ wang so@@ o already , i totally ab@@ hor po@@ ser@@ s , hypo@@ cr@@ ites , and such .
call me hy@@ ung from now on .
yes . yes , hy@@ ung .
at any rate , how did it go with writ@@ er lee ?
is she going to rev@@ ise the script ?
hy@@ ung , don 't get me started on it .
last night , that bastard anthony came all the way here , and ...
he came here ?
what ?
my script analy@@ sis is element@@ ary level and he called me the worst per@@ forming actor ever !
does that make sense ?
i 'm a bad actor ?
who does he have to thank for leading the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings ?
seriously !
sung mo ?
yes .
what do you think ?
about what ?
what else ?
my acting .
yes , you used to be one of the normal vie@@ wers , so you would be an ac@@ cur@@ ate judge .
tell me .
is the acting performance of this k@@ ang hy@@ un min pa@@ the@@ tic ?
just be honest .
just be honest .
is it really true ?
yes .
what do you mean , yes ?
well , i mean , you have good looks , but but your acting isn 't ... that great .
hey , sung mo , you must be refer@@ ring to hy@@ un min 's debut performance !
uh ... i 've watched them all ... even the most recent ones .
well , you told me to be honest .
g@@ wang so@@ o ...
[ g@@ wang so@@ o ]
uh , hy@@ ung , what i said earlier didn 't upset you , did it ?
why would it upset me ?
who do you think i am ?
sung mo , i 'm not that pet@@ ty . well , that 's a relief . you know ,
i 'm really bad at lying .
i can see that .
just focus on driving . so that we won 't be late .
yes , hy@@ ung .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's imp@@ act@@ ful performance cros@@ ses the sea with his eyes ]
honestly , k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's acting is over@@ rat@@ ed .
his good looks covers it all . however , those looks are fad@@ ing , too .
i 'm only watching it for sung min ah . when i see kh@@ m , i can 't concentr@@ ate on the show .
he su@@ cks .
hey , what day is better than christmas day to conf@@ ess your fel@@ ings to her ?
you have to make a das@@ h for it !
he 's right .
well , that 's why i bought something for her ,
what ?
what is it ?
let 's see !
show us !
excuse me .
mat@@ ching rings !
am i going too forward with this ?
does the woman express the feelings first ?
it is the man who has to open up first ! hear , hear !
besides , a mat@@ ching set of rings sen@@ ds a direct message of " let 's date . "
it 's stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward !
- true , true .
i read a report that the gift that women want the most for christmas is jewel@@ ry !
i got this after reading that .
what 's so mer@@ ry here ?
well , pd jo@@ o got a gift for the pretty f@@ d .
i 'm sorry , represent@@ ative .
not separ@@ ating my personal life from work ...
well , that 's life after all .
so what is it that you 're hiding ?
huh ?
let me see what you got her .
tada !
they 're couple rings .
sup@@ pose@@ dly , this is what women want the most for christmas .
good luck .
where do you buy stuff like that ?
would you like me to take them out for you to see ?
the second one from the right .
this one ?
is it a gift ?
no .
my neph@@ ew has been beg@@ ging me for it .
par@@ don ?
well , i guess my neph@@ ew got a girlfriend , but he 's so sh@@ y .
ah , i see .
what is the neph@@ ew 's size ?
well , maybe ... about this ? ah , i guess his size is the same as the uncle ?
we 're family , after all .
ah .
then , what about the size of the girl your neph@@ ew likes ?
well ,
i think about this big .
you 're going to gift it , you should call and ask first .
if the size doesn 't fit after opening the gift , she may think you 're not consider@@ ate .
bong dal kim .
mr. bong dal .
yes , represent@@ ative .
do you have plans this evening ?
why ?
why else ?
we 've got to write our contr@@ act .
why are we writing the contr@@ act on christmas eve ?
in the evening even ?
because i say so .
at 8@@ pm , come to the restaurant that ... no , i 'll decide on the location .

a nice place that i really like .
must be a sha@@ b@@ by place that su@@ its you perfectly .
you 'll have to see for yourself . i 'll text you . see you later then .

i 'm done already .
that 's good .

yes ?
this is the moon@@ hwa university hospital .
your test resul@@ ts from thur@@ s@@ day are out .
yes .
yes , i see .
i 'm on my way .

let 's finish this quick so we can get home early .
yes , understood !

i 'm sorry . i only prepared the 200@@ mm len@@ se .
then , use the 200@@ mm len@@ se , we 'll cro@@ p later , and magnif@@ y it to look like 300@@ mm .
yes .

ah , i see .
well , then ... do you have time this evening ?
well , if the shooting gets done early enough , sure . then , we 'll res@@ ume shooting in 5 minutes , so tell mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min to get ready , please .
yes , i understand .
wo@@ o jin !
wo@@ o jin !
are you okay ?
how can this be ?
!
this is all my fault !
wo@@ o jin !
wo@@ o jin !
are you alright ?
don 't worry .
the people ...
i am sorry .
cut !
let 's go again .
ready ?
action !
don 't worry .
soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i am sorry .
don 't worry . soon , people ...
i really am sorry .
cut !
let 's take a break for 10 minutes .
what exactly is the problem ?
is it because i refused the commercial en@@ dor@@ sement deal ?
that 's not it .
if not , then why are you making me cry for hours like this ?
!
i 'm really sorry .
i 'm just feeling under the weather today .
i 'm really sorry . i 'm really sorry .
how much have i cried ?
my eyes are gon@@ na be all pu@@ ffed up .
un@@ ni , can you get me an ice pack ?
yes .
do you have some time ?
i have something to say .
start talking . what is it ?
you 're not hung up about the commercial ...
is my acting really that bad ?
from your perspec@@ tive , is my acting really poor ? from your perspec@@ tive , is my acting really poor ?
what do you want me to say ?
please tell me honestly . as an act@@ ress . for you to ask me in person , doesn 't that mean you already think so ?
then , let me ask you one thing .
have you ever put any effort into acting ?
or do you know about your weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
then , what about you ?
do you have a weak@@ ness you know about ?
who doesn 't have weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
i 'm still practic@@ ing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to im@@ prove my pronunci@@ ation since my debut .
ga g@@ ya geo g@@ yeo , like a child learning the alphabet , with a pen between my teeth .
if you really felt a problem with your acting , you yourself have to know what it is to fix it .
no matter what other people tell you , you have to know it for yourself .
spend some time to think about it .
it doesn 't seem like a side effect of the anti@@ depres@@ sant .
there doesn 't seem to be a problem with your other tests .
then why does my vision get blur@@ ry sometimes ?
h@@ mm ... how about getting yourself test@@ ed at the op@@ thal@@ m@@ ology ?
i 'll ar@@ range it .
since you 're here already , why don 't you get test@@ ed .
tada ~ it looks nice .
what exactly is the problem ?
do you have a family member with poor ey@@ es@@ ight ?
yes .
that is correct .
is that your mother ?
yes , but how ? yes , you have le@@ ber 's her@@ edit@@ ary op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y that is matern@@ ally in@@ her@@ ited .
it progres@@ ses really fast with few pre@@ lim@@ in@@ ary symp@@ tom@@ s , so your right eye is already in bad shape .
looking at the pace of the condition , your right eye will lose its sight completely soon .
once that happens , unfortunately , even your left eye will ... eventually , you 'll lose sight in both your eyes .
wow , i hadn 't seen you in a while .
have you been well ?
yes , have you been well ?
yes .
would you like to order ?
well , i 'm waiting for someone today . when he gets here , i will .
did you get a boyfriend by any chance ?
no .
i 'm here .
where are you ?
i 'm here ...
where are you ?
in search of lost time
please leave a trace after reading the book .
( all entr@@ ies are by lee go e@@ un )
since your mother has this condition , you must know it very well .
there is no real way to cure it .
i regret to say this , but you should make prepar@@ ations before both eyes lose sight .
ah , what are you doing ?
!
can 't you pour the water proper@@ ly ?
my eyes sting !
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not eating !
why ?
does it taste bad ?
you eat it , mom .
you can 't even tell sugar and salt apart !
dum@@ my .
idiot !
excuse me .
i guess the traffic is bad .
um ... i 'm sorry , but we 're closing .
ah , yes ...
where did you go to be back so late ?
you ignored my text and my calls .
what is this ?
i 'm sorry .
well , was something the matter ?
yes .
my mother was not well .
omo . is she doing okay ?
well , if that 's what happened , why didn 't you tell me ?
well , i guess you didn 't really have the mind to do that .
get in .
since you so desperately wish to ren@@ ew my contr@@ act , i 'll do it .
let 's do that later .
it 's late . get back and rest .
lee go e@@ un ...
when did it start ?
your feelings for me .
i dece@@ iv@@ ed you .
i betr@@ ayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite all that , when did you start lik@@ ing me ?
episode 17 do not be afraid of the darkness i dece@@ iv@@ ed you . i betr@@ ayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite that , when did you start lik@@ ing me ? did something happen ?
nothing happened . get inside and rest . represent@@ ative !
why was he like that ?
what happened that he even had tears in his eyes ?
reg@@ ret@@ tab@@ ly , it looks like the initial diagno@@ sis still stands .
since your mother has this condition , you must know this already , but there is no way to cure it at this point .
* cur@@ r@@ ently , no cure is avail@@ able .
how to learn br@@ aille
you need to start getting ready for it .
normally , people with ac@@ quired blind@@ ness take about 3-@@ 5 years to ad@@ just to be able to per@@ form daily func@@ tions .
even just getting out of the house can feel like a form@@ id@@ able challenge .
from just grabbing a spo@@ on to going to the bathroom , you have to learn how to do them by yourself .
do you have family that could take care of you ?
what is the per@@ cent@@ age ?
the chance of me going blind .
i 'll ask one more question .
why is it me ?
my mom wasn 't enough ?
why are you even doing this to me ? i have finally found the reason why i must produce dram@@ as , and i have also found the person who pointed it out to me .
and yet , after all that , why did you choose me ?
tell me . if you 're there , tell me !
why is it me ?
why ?
!
ready .
action !
my face ... take a good look .
this face ...
don 't ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
i 'm sorry , but can we do it again ?
but your eyes were really good just now .
why ? no , my gaze at jin h@@ ye rin needs to be full of sad@@ ness ,
i don 't think it was enough this time .
alright then .
alright , let 's do it one more time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
let 's do it one more time .
the director said it was okay .
why do you keep asking him to film it again ?
don 't p@@ ity me .
i 'm not saying this out of p@@ ity !
your eyes really did look sad ! i appreciate your comfor@@ ting words , but you have to clearly point out my fla@@ ws for my acting to im@@ prove so that i can become a good actor .
director !
let 's do it one last time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget it .
cut !
how 's this one ?
you satisfied ?
yes .
i think it 's okay .
okay .
then , get ready for scene 38 !
sung mo !
script !
yes , hy@@ ung .
what 's wrong with him ?
did something happen ?
he wants to get better .
get better at what ?
acting skil@@ ls .
hy@@ un min said that ?
yes .
i 'm going to be worn out , it seems .
things to do from now on .
what are you doing ?
just some things .
can we speak ... for a bit ?
come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday .
in search of lost time
after so much time has passed , she finally read@@ s the confes@@ sion the man had left in the book .
and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go e@@ un ♥ and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go e@@ un ♥
when did you come ?
just now .
ah , i see .
i will answer the question you asked yesterday .
it 's true that i like you .
i don 't know since when , but it 's correct that i like you .
i will also ask one question .
yesterday ... why did you cry ?
there 's something wrong right ?
i 've been suff@@ ering from depression for three years .
that 's why i 'm crying , so it has nothing to do with you , so don 't mind it .
pretend that the issue of contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al never happened .
as if it never happened ?
what are you sud@@ d@@ ently talking about ?
there is one reason .
the relationship between a produc@@ er and writ@@ er should be up@@ right with the right amount of fear and respect .
since the moment you started lik@@ ing me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
then ...
what about sung min ah ?
you didn 't do that at that time .
but now it 's like that .
we can 't continue working together .
does that answer your question some@@ what ?
i will take my leave .
i have an important ap@@ pointment .
you 've come again .
hello !
who ... ?
the writ@@ er who came last time .
it 's good to meet you . i actually wanted to see you .
is your body fine ?
i heard you weren 't well yesterday .
did my son say that yesterday ?
ah ...
i guess i must 've heard wrong .
no@@ wad@@ ays is out of control because of the script .
you have a hard time because of my son right ?
no , he is so nice to me .
that 's good , that you think about him like that . he grew up with a blind single par@@ ent , so his person@@ ality is _ _ _ _ _ , but his heart is kind .
i heard ... that you couldn 't see when he was five ...
at that time ... my heart hurt so much ... at first , my vision started to get blur@@ ry , but i thought it would get better over time .
instead , one eye went blind , and the other eye ended up blind as well .
i found out later that that 's how op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y progres@@ ses .
at any rate , you must be a special person to my son .
huh ?
why do you think so ?
because he told you about things like that .
ah . to be honest ...
i confes@@ sed my feelings to the represent@@ ative .. .@@ and i got rej@@ ec@@ ted .
my son ... by nature , has no vision for women .
right ? !
i mean i 'm this pretty ...
i think he really doesn 't have an eye for girls .
what are you talking about ?
that doing business together is going to be hard ?
i 'm sorry .
can i ask the reason why you are refus@@ ing ?
it 's a personal issue , so i can 't tell you .
i hope that instead of me , you will find a good partner .
chil@@ dish ! say if you don 't like a person , you 're always nag@@ ging me about the script .
if you know , hurry up and write the script , everyone is waiting .
i am a crazy girl for wor@@ rying about bong dal .
cros@@ sing out " can@@ cel the invest@@ ment deal with ta@@ es@@ an "
morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ song end of episode 19
i sent the 19@@ th episode
got it .
ah ... it 's done , but ...
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min sure will compl@@ ain about the hair ...
the 19@@ th episode came out .
really ?
it came out a lot faster than i thought .
what ?
i guess hy@@ un min 's hair@@ style changes , to a shor@@ ter hair@@ cut .
what ? what , what , what ?
so you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult .
could you please change that part this time ?
i 'm very sorry .
i was concerned about it , too , actually .
you don 't think you can persu@@ ade him ?
it is to signif@@ y the start of kim wo@@ o jin 's choice of an ordin@@ ary life .
to tell you the truth , hy@@ un min is cur@@ r@@ ently working on getting an en@@ dor@@ sement deal for a sham@@ po@@ o .
an en@@ dor@@ sement for sham@@ po@@ o ?
yes .
so , if he gets a hair@@ cut , he won 't be able to do it at all .
yes .
if it 's about an en@@ dor@@ sement deal , k@@ ang hy@@ un min sure wouldn 't want to cut his hair .
exactly !
i 'm sorry , miss writ@@ er .
i guess it can 't be helped .
i 'll change it .
really ? oh , thank you !
miss writ@@ er lee !
writ@@ er lee !
isn 't this hy@@ un min 's voice ?
- writ@@ er lee !
i guess he 's already come to compl@@ ain .
writ@@ er lee !
- don 't tell him that i was here !
writ@@ er lee !
open this door , now !
oh heav@@ ens !
what do you think ?
is this accep@@ table ?
you got a hair@@ cut !
of course .
a new wo@@ o jin style .
but , how did you ...
why ?
i got it cut after i saw the script .
do you want it shor@@ ter ?
just tell me !
well , mr. hy@@ un min , weren 't you after a sham@@ po@@ o en@@ dor@@ sement ... ?
who car@@ es about en@@ dor@@ sements ?
even if a tv or a car en@@ dor@@ sement deal is on the table , if it is for the drama , i should cut it !
with over@@ flo@@ wing spirit !
hy@@ ung !
what are you doing here ?
well , actually , to thank her for making your character so aw@@ esome .
that 's why i 'm here .
is that so ?
at any rate , writ@@ er lee , the last week of morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong will be full of this k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's imp@@ act@@ ful acting spirit , just you wait .
fighting !
fighting !
director nam , what do you mean by that ? you can 't exten@@ d morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ?
to exten@@ d a drama that was origin@@ ally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we 're only doing it for the rat@@ ings .
rather than that , just fin@@ ishing the drama with its current qu@@ ality seems to be the better choice , in my jud@@ g@@ ment .
listen , director nam . " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has just gone over 25 % , and is on the ver@@ ge of getting into the 30 % range .
if we add 4 more episodes , we 'll get the rat@@ ing over 30 % for sure , how can you sug@@ gest not doing it ? however , if you just prol@@ ong the story , it will in@@ evit@@ ably lead to a drop in the qu@@ ality .
in that case , it may ru@@ in what we have accompl@@ ished so far with " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
director nam , are you crazy ?
do you know how much of the prof@@ its from commerci@@ als depen@@ ds on 1 % of the rat@@ ings ?
this isn 't a place of art !
this is a business that needs to make a profit ! well , director ... - director nam ,
i understand your point of view , director nam . but this time , i would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself .
four more episodes ?
yes .
i 'm surprised by your lack of enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
don 't produ@@ cer@@ s usually welcome extension de@@ als in a situation like this ?
yes , we 'll make the necessary prepar@@ ations .
then ...
why ?
does he think 4 is too short ?
no , no .
he says he 'll prepare for it .
if we add 4 more episodes , that means 4 more weeks from now , starting with episode 19 .
i wonder what the od@@ ds are for my ey@@ es@@ ight to last until then ?
could i really do it ?
no , i must do it .
please , hang on until then .
well now , i know how everybody must be tired , but since it 's been decided to exten@@ d the show , let 's do our best to the end ! yes !
fighting !
what do you think ? to spike up the last pit@@ ch , new wo@@ o jin style !
what 's with your faces ?
your hair ... why did you cut it so soon ?
excuse me ?
i cut it too soon ? well , we got an extension of 4 more episodes .
extension ?
yes .
well , to prol@@ ong the story , the ending will have to change .
hy@@ un min , since it 's been extended , let 's go for 30 % of the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing !
i 'm coun@@ ting on you !
what were you doing , not being aware of the extension deal ?
my last big impact !
the new hair@@ cut of wo@@ o jin style !
how can you make it all into nothing like this ? ! hy@@ un min , at any rate , now that it 's been decided , let 's go for 30 % of vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing , and get more money for the extended episodes .
isn 't that s@@ well ?
hy@@ ung , is money all your concern ?
from now on , don 't ever insul@@ t my passion and spirit for acting with mere money .
well , then , are you not going to ask for a raise ?
how much more did sung min ah ask for ? are you crazy ? you know that you 're sched@@ ul@@ ed for a movie right away , and yet you agreed to the extension ?
min ah , this isn 't just any movie , but a movie direc@@ ted by cho k@@ yu sik .
besides , you 're the lead act@@ ress .
you know fully well how your sched@@ ule won 't allow for both the drama and the movie .
isn 't it your job to make that sched@@ ule work ?
so , just do as i said .
who exactly is the reason why you 're doing this ?
is it for anthony ? or ,
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
is it because of him ?
listen carefully .
don 't ever stick me with that mor@@ on again !
got it ?
why do you keep bar@@ ging in when i didn 't call you ?
extension ?
yes .
but i just have one more episode to work on .
how can i add 4 more episodes ? in order to write those 4 episodes without sacrific@@ ing the qu@@ ality , we have to rev@@ ise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday .
episode 19 ... uh ...
i know it won 't be easy .
however , from episode 19 to 24 , you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away .
the live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started .
you can do it , right ?
i will have to .
yes . as this is an emergen@@ cy , put extra effort and write with speed .
where are you going ?
why ?
well , last time , you came fully lo@@ aded even with health sup@@ pl@@ ements . i 'm not writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un or anything , i couldn 't possibly write on without discus@@ sing the p@@ lot , is what you had said .
we should discus@@ s the p@@ lot .
this is an emergen@@ cy .
i 'm not doing this because i have ul@@ ter@@ ior mo@@ tives .
did i ask ?
the new episode 19
i 'm glad that we got done so fast .
you have to keep this pace from now on .
ah , before you leave , could you get me a glass of water ?
are you asking me to do that for you ?
what can you do ?
the writ@@ er with high vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings is cur@@ r@@ ently busy writing .
what are you doing ?
can 't you see it 's over@@ flo@@ wing ?
you can 't even pour me some water ?
so don 't ask me to do it again !
did you do it on purpose ?
yes , that 's right .
just move !
it spil@@ led to the floor !
let 's go . just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give up ? sung mo , get your emotions into it !
go again .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give it up ?
ah , this isn 't working , either .
i need something to help me get into it .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
are you sure you won 't give up on your dream ?
as long as you are by my side . wo@@ o jin ,
wo@@ o jin hu@@ gs h@@ ye rin .
no , no , no !
i can 't practice at all like this .
can 't you stop now ?
you 've been at it for 4 hours already .
we even ski@@ pped lunch !
wait a minute .
why didn 't i think of this before ?
instead , i can only give you 2 days a week for your drama .
that 's the least you can do , min ah .
of course .
i understand .
miss sung min ah ?
you can answer it .
oh , there 's no need .
it 's not an important call .
the phone is turned off , so the vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail ...
ignoring my calls , huh ?
ok .
we have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the lat@@ est .
yes .
i 'm so sorry , director .
i 'll be right back .
why do you keep calling me ?
if only you had answered it the first time .
you 're the one who made me call you several times .
i 'm in a meeting with a film production .
that 's none of my concern .
just come to the shooting site right now .
shooting doesn 't start until 2 hours from now !
that 's why we should get together and practice !
if you don 't come now , i 'll call the film production myself , got it ?
bye !
he must have really lost his mind !
victory !
let 's go with this spirit !
sung mo !
i 'll be back , g@@ wang so@@ o .
hey , what about lunch ?
what should i do ?
i 'm so sorry , director .
looks like i have to go now for the shooting sched@@ ule today .
it 's ok .
you may go .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll talk to you later , director .
they must be really going great together .
yes ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min and min ah , i mean .
yes ? ah , no , that 's not really ... at any rate , there must be no wedding announ@@ c@@ ements before the movie release .
yes ? just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
let 's leave .
just like any other ...
you 're here !
isn 't it really cold outside ?
let 's leave .
we should practice it like we 're really doing it !
on your feet !
practice is only practice .
this k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's acting is for real !
do you normally practice so casu@@ ally , miss sung min ah ?
if you really want to do it for real , get rid of that script first .
ok .
now , ready , action !
let 's leave . just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
can you really give up on your dream and live on ?
as long as you 're with me .
wo@@ o jin ...
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ...
i 'm so sorry !
we start shooting in 10 minutes .
what are you doing ?
go and clear up her mis@@ understanding !
is that pet@@ ty little mis@@ understanding that important ?
my burning passion for acting won 't die because of it !
now , one more time .
why do you have to be so extreme in everything ?
i e-@@ ma@@ iled you the script for episode 19 , mr. kim bong dal .
wow , he doesn 't even text me back any more .
start out@@ lin@@ ing episode 20 .
we can 't always work on it together .
since they 've worked for me , i know how s@@ killed and fa@@ ith@@ ful they are .
well , with your re@@ commen@@ dation , i know they must be good , sun@@ ba@@ e .
hm , looks like they have quite some experience ?
they 've gone through a lot in this field .
they 'll be a great as@@ set to you .
you have to pay them at least that much .
at any rate , why are you hand@@ ing over such great wor@@ kers ? ah , well , it 's because ...
yes , director .
i just needed to stop at the office .
yes , i 'll be there in about 2 hours .
hello ?
is this world production 's jo@@ o dong su@@ k pd ?
yes , but who is this ?
hello , i 'm calling on be@@ half of drama production company golden song .
we would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benef@@ its .
could we have a meeting ?
ah , uh , me ?
yes , i heard that you are very tal@@ ent@@ ed .
we 'll give you 20 % more than your current sal@@ ary . ah , yes , well , but , actually , i 'm cur@@ r@@ ently working on a project .
also , to leave my current company all of a sudden seems ... of course , we understand .
you can take your time to consider our offer while fin@@ ishing up with your current project .
we 'll contact you again .
what now ? you were so heart@@ broken by that girl , did something good happen ?
i just got a job offer from another drama production company . hey , you too ?
i got one , too !
me too !
what ?
we all got an offer from somewhere ?
even so , i want to keep working with represent@@ ative kim to the end .
i suppose i will , too .
at any rate , the sal@@ ary they offered was pretty temp@@ ting .
true , after all , our company is on the low side when it comes to sal@@ aries in this field .
speaking of which , i have a good idea .
the four of us can keep our lo@@ yal@@ ty , but let 's ask for a raise of 10 % .
or else , we 'll quit .
thre@@ aten him like that in f@@ ake ?
yes .
isn 't it great ?
i 'm in .
i 'm in , too .
are you in ?
in .
he 's in , too .
what are you doing so hud@@ d@@ led up together ?
represent@@ ative , i have something to tell you .
i 'll listen to it later .
i have something to say first .
once " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is finished , i 'm going to close my company .
what ? i got a partner@@ ship offer from ta@@ es@@ an group , but they didn 't want to keep your employ@@ ment .
by ta@@ es@@ an ... one of the top , leading compan@@ ies in the country .
there@@ fore , everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over .
team leader park , you should calcul@@ ate the sever@@ ance fee for everyone and put it on my desk .
hey , what was that ?
did we just get back@@ stab@@ bed ?
i heard that wrong , right ?
no wonder he had been surpris@@ ingly nice to us lat@@ ely .
what was the number from that other production company ?
cros@@ sing out " transfer emplo@@ ye@@ es ( close the company ) "
sweet po@@ tat@@ o
what ?
what else ?
i just got done with episode 20 .
so , if you 're in the office , make a short trip to my studio .
what do you think ?
you did pretty well by yourself .
what ?
this doesn 't make sense .
where ? scene 38 , if h@@ ye rin is meeting with represent@@ ative k@@ ang , is she betr@@ aying wo@@ o jin again ?
ah , that 's because there is a surprise element later on .
it 's all explained in scene 56 .
what is it ?
ah , no , nothing .
what do you think ?
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read it to the end !
i read it all .
you just flipped the page , and you read it all ?
yes , spe@@ ed@@ reading .
besides , i said it 's good .
why are you compl@@ aining ?
just keep writing the script . starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go page by page .
moon@@ hwa university hospital , please .
your condition is progres@@ sing much faster than most other pati@@ ents .
unfortunately , your right eye has already lost it 's sight .
it 's already started for your left eye , too .
how long will it take ?
for the left eye to lose sight completely ?
no .
how much time do i have left ? it is difficult to say for sure , but looking at it 's current pace , somewhere between 4 weeks and 2 months from now , your left eye will lose sight as well .
the more i think about it , the ang@@ rier i get .
he was so car@@ eless and ru@@ de .
was i cl@@ ing@@ y or what ?
is reading this that hard ?
why does it have 2 sheets of page 3 ?
then , he didn 't get to see scene 56 at all .
what do you think .
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read to the end !
i read it all .
why did he lie like that ?
at first , my vision was just blur@@ ry a little .
i thought it would get better over time .
but one eye lost its sight , and eventually , the other one did , too .
what are you doing ?
it 's over@@ flo@@ wing !
what is it ?
no , nothing .
i found out later that that 's how op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y progres@@ ses .
this can 't be !
that 's not possible !
represent@@ ative !
are you inside ?

what to do from now on : 1 . mother 2 .

at least up until now , writ@@ er lee has been good about not making us do live shooting .
of course , that ends tomorrow .
yes .
it 's been 5 years since the last time i had to do that dog@@ ged live shooting .
director .
what is it ?
do you think you can finish morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong if i am not here ?
what do you mean ?
can you do it ?
why ?
does that ta@@ es@@ an or whatever company want you to start working with them so@@ oner ?
yes ?
i heard from jo@@ o pd .
i heard that you got a partner@@ ship offer there .
ah , yes .
go if you must , but only after fin@@ ishing this .
even though i have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you , this drama doesn 't work even for a day without you , represent@@ ative kim .
there@@ fore , until this is done , don 't even think about running away .
now , let 's pick up the pace !
it 's going to get dark soon !
- yes !
yes !
is the preparation for the move going well ?
i 'm talking about the move to ta@@ es@@ an group .
when will it be ?
ah , that matter ... i want to send flowers . when is it ?
well , the prior@@ ity at the moment is " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
so just focus on the drama for now .
the date for the move hasn 't been decided yet ?
we 'll get to it eventually .
then ...
for@@ get@@ le@@ ego e@@ un
ther@@ el@@ ation@@ ship@@ bet@@ we@@ en@@ the writ@@ er@@ and@@ the@@ produc@@ er re@@ qui@@ res a balan@@ ced tension of fear and respect .
now that you have started to like me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
cros@@ sing@@ out " for@@ get@@ lee goe@@ un "
shall we go in ?
too much cold air isn 't good for you .
maybe in just a little bit .
hello !
you 're busy .
why did you come ?
i 'm not busy .
my emplo@@ ye@@ es are doing all the work .
still , as the represent@@ ative , you should be present in the work place .
you shouldn 't just leave all the work to your emplo@@ ye@@ es .
mom .
what ? when i was young , what was it like when i made fun of you and was mean because you couldn 't see ?
wasn 't it up@@ setting ?
when was that ... such a long time ago .
i 'm sorry , mom .
what 's the matter ?
did something happen ?
tell me .
did something bad happen to you ?
it 's nothing .
once my current drama is done , i might be off to ab@@ road because my business is going so well .
so stay still . since i might not be able to see your face for a while ,
i want to keep your face in my eyes .
oh , i see .
it 's a good thing that your business is going well .
instead of wor@@ rying , just go and return , because i will be fine .
your hands are cold .
let 's go inside , mom .
yes .
by the way , is that a new scar@@ f ?
yes .
i got it as a gift .
a gift ?
from whom ?
she beg@@ ged me not to tell you ... actually , to tell you the truth , i ... confes@@ sed my feelings to the represent@@ ative and got rej@@ ec@@ ted .
my@@ child just doesn 't have a good eye for women .
that 's right .
i 'm pretty like this .
i agree that he doesn 't have an eye for women .
i brought a present for you .
there 's a present ?
yes .
i kn@@ it it myself , it ke@@ eps you really warm in the winter .
if you look here , it says b d k .
b-@@ d-@@ k ?
yes .
bong dal kim .
you shouldn 't do that to such a nice young lady . if it 's because you have to go ab@@ road , tell her .
because it seems to me , she really is a nice girl .
where have you been ?
did you finish the script ?
it 's cold . instead of cat@@ ching cold again , go in .
how long were you going to conce@@ al it ?
until when were you going to conce@@ al the fact that you are going blind ?
you said it was depression .
you said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business .
correct .
it 's none of your business so beat it .
how can it not concern me ?
so what ?
what can you do for me ?
yes .
what you are saying about my not being able to see is correct .
i won 't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom .
i won 't be able to see the dram@@ as which i made .
or the scrip@@ ts either .
i won 't be able to see your face and where you are standing , and whether you are smiling or crying
i won 't be able to see .
is that why you are giving up ?
what if i say it doesn 't matter to me ?
for me , it doesn 't matter .
we have to en@@ dure lack of sleep , script by pages , and miser@@ able life to make sure there 's no shame in our every minute , every second and keep us reminded of who we are at this moment .
the last tape of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " hasn 't made it to the edit@@ ing room yet .
even if it 's just 1 % of hope , that 's better than nothing .
a miracle is not something you wait for , but something you cre@@ ate .
the represent@@ ative , the represent@@ ative , on his way , had an accident ...
you must come back with that miracle !
the finale the last of the king , or the last king . where have you been ?
did you finish the script ? don 't catch a cold in this cold weather . hurry and go in .
until when are you going to hide that ? until when are you going to hide the fact you 're going blind now ? you said , what , depression ?
didn 't you say it 's none of my business so don 't bother ?
yes .
it 's none of your business , so back off .
why is it none of my business ?
so what ?
what can you do for me , then ? that 's right . as you said , it 's true that i won 't be able to see any longer .
i won 't be able to eat or go to the wash@@ room by myself . i won 't be able to see the dram@@ as i made , or your scrip@@ ts ,
or your face either .
even where you 're standing , even whether you 're smiling at me or crying ,
i won 't be able to see all of them .
is that why you 're giving up ?
what if i say it still doesn 't matter ?
i 'm saying it doesn 't matter to me .
it will be difficult ( for you ) to en@@ dure .
even so , i want to go that way .
let 's go together .
maybe , this will be my last time to see the sun@@ rise .
even if you can 't see , i will make you be able to feel it .
and beside you , i will be there .
even if you can 't see the dram@@ as you made , even if you can 't see my face or my drama , where you 're standing , whether you 're smiling at me or crying , i will see all of them .
since we came all the way here , will we have some time to sleep ?
what ... what did you say ?
why are you so startled ?
wa ... wait !
i ... am ... not that easy of a woman .
what are you thinking now ?
i 'm saying let 's take a short nap in the car .
considering that our way back home would be a great hard@@ ship , don 't you think we should take a nap ?
so vul@@ gar !
that 's right !
i 'm so vul@@ gar !
with this driving s@@ kill , how on earth did you get your driving license ?
i told you , this is the first time i 'm driving since i got the license !
to be precise , this is your second time .
what ?
once to come here , and second time to go back .
if it 's your second time , there should be some im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement .
you chic@@ kened out !
just look where you 're driving !
okay . from now on , for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes , we should run around bus@@ ily making sure they will be ai@@ red with no accident .
even if we have to en@@ dure a life like a thir@@ d-@@ r@@ ater with light sleeping and pag@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ page scrip@@ ts , those minutes and seconds of our r@@ respec@@ tive moments will make us later remember our@@ selves in this right moment . the scrip@@ ts will be hand@@ led by writ@@ er lee and me , so pd jo@@ o , manager han , manager park and koo he@@ e j@@ ae , you guys take care of the film@@ ing sites . yes .
yes .
well , then do your best in your post .
got it ?
yes !
the real problem here is sung min ah , who is cur@@ r@@ ently film@@ ing both our drama and a movie . since sung min ah 's sched@@ ule isn 't favorable , you should write the script minim@@ iz@@ ing jin h@@ ye rin 's por@@ tion as much as possible .
you can do it , right ?
i will even kill jin h@@ ye rin if i have to at the last episode to make sure , so don 't worry .
the script for episode 20 arrived !
did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well ?
yes .
good . from now on , for all the scrip@@ ts we will rece@@ ive , we should film the scenes of min ah putting together as much as we can , so organize the sched@@ ule accor@@ d@@ ingly .
yes .
well , well , hurry up .
let 's run again !
yes .
kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin ! sung mo , - how many scenes in total ?
it 's 52 vs 36 .
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , you have many more scenes !
finally , my effort is shining .
the real value of my acting on the screen finally touched writ@@ er lee . there@@ fore , sung mo , you should try , too .
find your f@@ law .
the one who doesn know about one 's self would never be able to im@@ prove .
sung mo , what is your f@@ law ?
well , i don 't know , my f@@ law is ...
hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids ?
hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids ?
that ...
you just need to go to the hospital to treat it . well , by the way , hy@@ ung , all those lines , will you be able to memor@@ ize them all ?
if there are only a few lines , that 's the problem , not the other way around .
taking this opportunity , i should clearly show k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's burning acting skil@@ ls !
let 's go .
at the begin@@ ing of episode 21 , jin h@@ ye rin is cap@@ tured by president k@@ ang .
to save h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin will fight alone against all the enem@@ ies .
so that we can film jin h@@ ye rin 's scenes at once , all together in a long take ?
exactly !
it can en@@ han@@ ce it 's dramat@@ ic tension and also help us manage the film@@ ing sched@@ ule .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min would have a hard time , though .
good , let 's proce@@ ed in that way .
but how are your eyes ? are they alright ?
the other side 's eye is still fine .
what are you doing now , not writing ?
okay .
ah , i think i 'm really a gen@@ ius , don 't you think so ?
but really ... when was it that you started to like ?
huh ?
when did you start to like me ?
what about you ?
i asked you first .
so , for me ... when there was the argument about plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , you ... you said ... you would believe me no matter what ...

hy@@ un min ! everything was great , including your last stare !
ha ! of course , who am i ! ?
considering the speed of progress of your disease , it will be a bur@@ den if you keep working .
but there is something i must do .
if the blind@@ ness is un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , i 'm thinking to work as much as i can . actually , there is something i didn 't tell you because i didn 't want to give you too much hope .
rec@@ ently , in bas@@ com palmer eye institute in florida , u.s. , there was the first clin@@ ical tri@@ al of dna treat@@ ment for this disease .
its res@@ ult showed some pati@@ ents to be cu@@ red , even if its succes@@ s rate is really low . we don 't know when they will announ@@ ce the start of the second tri@@ al , and although when it is announced , it won 't be easy for you to be on the list , but i will try my best as well .
thank you .

mom is here .
oh , you 're here !
i 'm sorry , but i have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible .
ge@@ ez , i won 't interrup@@ t , so just keep writing !
hey , do you have an assistant writ@@ er ?
no , why ?
then , why do you have two to@@ oth@@ brus@@ hes ?
oh , that is ...
i haven 't seen these before , either .
wait , aren 't these for men ?
no , no ... that 's not ... you !
by any chance , that bong dal or something , did you let him in here all the time ?
no , mom , that 's not the case !
oh , you 're here !
oh , you came at the right time .
represent@@ ative , you said you know the guy named kim bong dal .
please give me his contact detail .
ah mom , that 's not the case .
what do you mean that 's not the case ? here are two to@@ oth@@ brus@@ hes , and even a man 's lo@@ tion . these are clearly its evidence !
this bastard !
i have to see his face ! ah ...
mother ... there must be some mis@@ understanding .
the guy named kim bong dal isn 't that bad .
that 's why i 'm saying i will meet him .

by the way , why did you write it yesterday ?
over there , on the pil@@ lar .
well , that 's because you seemed to have a really hard time , so i just wrote it on there .
is that all ?
then , of course , that 's all .
what else can it be ?
many women don 't know their own feelings .
fine . if your feeling for me is that deep , i won 't res@@ ist it any longer , not like i did before .
what did you say ?
you fell for me , right ?
please , don 't have such il@@ lus@@ ions !
you want to keep your pride ?
i also know well about women 's pride .
seriously ... what the ... cute . lovely .
there 's a lim@@ it to how sim@@ plem@@ in@@ ded you can get ...

i 'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is .

i was meaning to call you as well .
i know you 're busy .
my sched@@ ules are st@@ acked because of the movie and the drama .
well i 'm calling for your next project which we discus@@ sed before .

the writ@@ er who gave you a scar@@ f present .
i know who it is by her voice .
welcome .
mom , i kept my promise .
okay .
what ... promise ?
there is something like that .
what is ... that promise ?
yes .
i 've just received a message from the u.@@ s .
please come to the hospital as soon as possible .
the second clin@@ ical tri@@ al 's patient list is announced .
you 're on that list . as i 've told you before , the possibil@@ ity to avoid your blind@@ ness is as low as a miracle , but let 's hope for that miracle .
ah , and the reason i asked you to come here ur@@ gently was because you need to leave tomorrow , right away .
tomorrow ?
yes .
among the subject pati@@ ents , there was one patient , who missed the tim@@ ing to treat and went blind in both eyes , so that 's why you could be on that list instead of that patient .
to meet the due date per florida time , you must leave for florida tomorrow .
what is that expression about ?
- no - somebody 's got to do it
somebody 's got to do it
somebody 's got to do it

the a@@ wak@@ ening wasn 't too hard ?
no , tv still isn 't back but we were treated to a new episode star@@ ring one of our cit@@ iz@@ ens , last night
poor arm@@ and , poor stephanie
ah , but it 's not easy finding love
each time we open the door to our heart to let love in , we never know what else can get in at the same time , huh ?
fear , pain , mal@@ ice
but maybe also ten@@ dern@@ ess , joy , happiness
who knows ?
we never know
- happy birthday darling !
but , marie , i don 't drink
one glass of wine and i 'm drunk
- this is for the day i leave you
you won 't be able to do without this
- i io@@ ve your sense of hum@@ our
- yeah , it 's yours rubbing off
- keep it
but i never want you to use it because i '@@ ii never leave you
- i promise
where is my real gift ?
- come here
marie !
ok , the paper in doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's hand : did you find out what it is ?
- yeah
- and ?
what were you doing at the von trie@@ ck 's last night ?
- we wanted to talk to sarah
- what did she say ?
- well nothing
- what was the doctor 's paper ?
- give me a break ok ?
we had an agreement
since the beginning i 've given you all i 've had and i don 't get anything back in return
- yes i know - you 're hiding things from me
you went to see pierre too
did he give you the idea to talk to sarah ?
what did he say to you ? - go ask him , you '@@ ii find out
he doesn 't want to speak to me and everyone at the station thinks he 's a fre@@ ak
- you don 't say ?
- hey there , bottle neck
quit it , all right ?
sp@@ it it out or else
- swear that you won 't use it against pierre
- bir@@ on , you can 't sell out your sources to the police like that
- you can 't treat my friends this way either
- hey that 's him
- pierre was at blanche 's house the night she died
he said he saw the kids bring her body back
- come on the kids didn 't kill blanche
- no , i don 't think so either but stephanie said sarah saw someone take off on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier
- aren 't you
that famous journalist ?
- yeah , aren 't you ?
bernard
- yeah , yeah , louis-@@ bernard l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
- that 's it !
that 's it ! - well hi
- hi
- hi
so what about sam@@ u@@ ei 's sent@@ ence ? " got cell@@ s " ?
- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te thinks it has to do with the accident ten years ago , but
- the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ?
- yeah , the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- don 't you have , i@@ ike a talent , a magic trick or something ?
or a mal@@ formation or a scar
- come on
- what ? scar@@ s are cool
- no , no i won 't be a clo@@ wn in your fre@@ ak show , all right ?
- if you change your mind
- no , i won 't change my mind , forget it ok ?
- let 's go we '@@ ii stop bo@@ thering mr big star
- so , now that the sto@@ ol pi@@ geon has talked , could we find out what was on doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's paper ?
- a small piece of a scientif@@ ic magazine
- like any of the hund@@ reds in his office great !
- like any of the hund@@ reds , yes
but why that one ?
i did some research ;
it 's from " neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence en avant "
and guess who 's on the cover ?
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
the sci@@ ent@@ ist who 's in great bear to fix the tv signal
i ordered the magazine from the national library
- which will probably get here in two to three days
so , in the mean time
bir@@ on ?
in the mean time , tell me the story of the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- there were twelve guys
- we call them the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s but they didn 't really have any skil@@ ls
kind of the lo@@ ser@@ s of the area
and when you 're considered a loser in great bear
- cream of the cro@@ p for sure
- the municipality hi@@ red them to work on a piece of land where they would have put up a radar station
- a radar station ?
but , that 's not municipal department
- i just called the mayor 's office
the documents about that contr@@ act have disappeared from the files
- we have to talk to the mayor , to your father
- he won 't say anything
if the documents aren 't there , he decided it
if they still ex@@ ist though , i know where they are
in the safe in his office
- let me guess ; the problem is that he 's the only one who knows the combin@@ ation
- no , the problem is that he 's the only one who has the key
and he always ke@@ eps it on him
- i have good news and bad news
- the bad news ?
- there 's no doubt the waves produc@@ ing the images on tv are of ident@@ ical nature to the ones i was ob@@ tain@@ ing with my dev@@ ice , ten years ago
- incredi@@ ble the good news ?
- i 've identi@@ fied what could be the emit@@ ting source or at ie@@ ast a rel@@ ay
those dis@@ hes down there
- we 're getting closer
- who could be doing that ?
a@@ ii of my ex-@@ co@@ ii@@ abor@@ ators have been contac@@ ted , it 's beyond me
- exactly whoever is do@@ ings this is beyond you pa@@ qu@@ ette
i find this most excit@@ ing
the more reason for me to worry
i don 't want to interview edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
i just want to talk to him for two minutes
what 's the difference ?
listen , can you just tell me where i can find him ?
- even gast@@ onne can 't talk to him
ok , after " got cell@@ s " ?
" be there where the thie@@ f dances "
what does that mean ?
every time we get a lead , it goes absolutely nowhere
we have a new sent@@ ence which gives us a new lead and it 's a complete mess
- no , no bir@@ on
those lead@@ s don 't stop , they slow down
and they all point in the same direction
- oh yeah ?
which one ? - i don 't know yet
but i trust blanche 's clu@@ es
- so , go join pierre lam@@ y 's gang
- the hair@@ dres@@ ser ?
actually , i 'm certain we 'd find very interesting things in that book he took from blanche 's house
- blanche 's big book is full of old w@@ ives ' tales spread over thir@@ teen gener@@ ations
- bir@@ on , to sol@@ ve a problem , you have to go back to its orig@@ ins
you have to cut it at the ro@@ ot
fine ok
not only are the lead@@ s we have absolutely lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us , they 're cold as ice
the only concre@@ te fac@@ ts we have are the article about edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette found in doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's hand and the missing file on the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
- edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette , don 't you find that strange ?
a neur@@ olog@@ ist to fix a tv signal problem ?
- that accident always seemed very strange to me
and now , the tv fre@@ aks out
we have to open bei@@ iv@@ eau 's safe
- no , that 's il@@ legal
- i don 't give a damn
at least , it isn 't " es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic b@@ lah b@@ lah " ; it 's concre@@ te stuff
- picking the chief of police 's pocket never did any@@ body any good
i have an idea
bei@@ iv@@ eau might be the chief
hello ?
this is em@@ i@@ ie bir@@ on , yes
you wanted louis-@@ bernard l@@ apo@@ in@@ te for your gala ?
you shall have him
- out of the question !
- under one condition
- no , no , no !
- did you hear what arm@@ and said on tv ?
he 's in deep shit
- christian , the mer@@ chand@@ ise isn 't for you
- to be a good sal@@ es@@ man , you have to know your produc@@ t
- we only have one bu@@ yer and they 're very satisfied ;
it 's not necessary
- only one bu@@ yer , for now but i have some expansion projec@@ ts
- georges , your son is completely st@@ oned
- never mind christian
what were you doing with l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
- what , l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
- yes , l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
- yes - you spend a iot of time with him
- i 'm not den@@ ying it either
he 's a char@@ ming man , we have a iot in common
anyway , it 's none of your business anymore georges
- a iot in common ! we have a son ; we have a family in common what do you want ; you want us to get married ?
then we '@@ ii get married
- no , you don 't understand
- mr fer@@ ron !
we 're ready
- where are you ? who are you talking to ?
there 's an emergen@@ cy here , christian isn 't in any shape
montreal will be phon@@ ing in two seconds
- i '@@ ii call you later , ok ?
love you
christian fer@@ ron
hello
- christian , you '@@ ii have to admit that our second date can 't be any worse than the first
- did you know that your voice is really sexy ?
- i won 't say i 've never been told before
i have a feeling we '@@ ii get along , you and i , christian
our deal will go a iot smo@@ other this time , right ?
- the first time , we didn 't know each other
i 've told you my name , what 's yours ?
- call me bird - it 's do@@ ve , isn 't it ?
- what ?
- i gues@@ sed it , didn 't i ?
your voice is so soft , it su@@ its you , do@@ ve
- you don 't scar@@ e me with your big guns
you don 't want to tell me your real name ?
i '@@ ii call you do@@ ve - ok
- do@@ ve ?
help , somebody !
he@@ ien@@ e , he@@ ien@@ e !
i just want him to come back blanche
make him come back , i beg of you !
hus@@ h , you can 't make any noise
people will hear you , stop it
i don 't know what i was expecting by coming here so late tonight , if only to see you again for a moment
hope to see you soon
sarah is asleep
don 't worry , things will work out
- i just wonder where great bear is going without blanche
- to hell most likely
but you know , she isn 't really gone yet
- you feel her too ?
but it 's like she 's mu@@ te , like sarah
- do you know why the nat@@ ives never settled near great bear ?
- no
- when i was young , one of my really old gre@@ at-@@ aun@@ ts came to visit from holland
my grand@@ father showed her around the mine and the town
in those days it was still the " von trie@@ ck mine "
he was proud
then my gre@@ at-@@ aunt , who had pretty much the same powers as blanche , asks my grand@@ father what " re@@ frac@@ ting stones " are
so my grand@@ father expl@@ ains ;
re@@ frac@@ ting stones are rocks used to build chim@@ ne@@ ys , stones that you can heat up as much as you want they will never crack
when she he@@ ars that , my gre@@ at-@@ aunt is over@@ taken by verti@@ go and starts shou@@ ting : " stop !
stop ! "
you should have seen it ;
the guys in the mine were fre@@ aking out
so my grand@@ father takes her by the shoulders and asks her :
" what 's the matter ? "
she man@@ ages to catch her breath , and all cros@@ s-@@ eyed , starts saying : " you shouldn 't move this rock , it is rock that never bur@@ ns ;
god put it there to block the gates of hell
if you keep dig@@ ging , demons from the ab@@ y@@ ss will come to the surface and tor@@ ment you "
then my grand@@ father grab@@ s her , sho@@ ves her in the truck and says : " crazy old woman , go back where you came from , you proph@@ et of doom ! "
well , you know what ?
the nat@@ ives had the same legend pretty much word for word
that 's why they never settled near great bear
- so what ?
you think that
- i think i don 't like proph@@ ets of doom !
- come on , bi@@ an@@ che wasn 't a proph@@ et of doom !
- how would you know , fer@@ ron ?
no , but really
how would you know ?
- rum and co@@ ke , just the way you i@@ ike it
i 'm glad you came by
i have things to be for@@ given for
- oh yeah ?
what 's that ?
- you can go
i 'm not keeping you
- you know very well what i want
- you know very well that i won 't give it to you
you '@@ ii have to wait until the deal is done to get your share , like the rest of us
- i need money to leave town
and if do@@ ve knows i 'm involved , it 's not good for you either
- i know , but if do@@ ve fin@@ ds you , she '@@ ii kill you
so i bet you '@@ ii make sure she doesn 't know you 're here
see how much i trust you ?
- i 'm not alone in this
what about christian ?
do you really trust him ?
- he 's my son
i 'm giving him a chance to ear@@ n my trust
lay low for a few days and everything will be fine
- you like it ?
- huh ? what ?
- you like it , eh ?
- yes , yes , yes , em@@ i@@ ie , em@@ i@@ ie !
em@@ i@@ ie , em@@ i@@ ie !
- yeah , yeah , yeah
- let 's go
- where ?
- i don 't know
a@@ ii she said was : " i have to talk to you "
then she hung up come on , hurry up !
- no , i 'm much better now
i should be going
you got what you wanted ?
yeah
it 's been clear , lat@@ ely , that i will never have anything else
even this , i didn 't think anyway
- emile
what l@@ apo@@ in@@ te said about me that i 'm an opport@@ un@@ ist and un@@ happy
- ah , forget about that
- no , no , there 's truth in that , i know
but i 'd i@@ ike you to give me a second chance , because
i don 't want to stay un@@ happy
think about it , ok ?
yeah , ok
i '@@ ii think about it
she 's here
- would you stop saying " she " ?
- he , she it doesn 't matter
- forgive me girls i haven 't slept in two days
i 'm trans@@ lat@@ ing the book
- and what does it say ?
- a iot of things but
this isn 't blanche 's book
- what do you mean , it isn 't blanche 's book ?
bi@@ an@@ che gave it to you
- she didn 't give it to me
i took it
- so , what does that change ?
- you st@@ ole it
that changes everything
he 's not the hei@@ ress to the powers
- explain yourself
- every one of these books was written over thir@@ teen gener@@ ations
- yes , one chapter per generation , and ?
- the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter of this book has already been written
- then blanche wrote the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h
- blanche didn 't write in this book
and she didn 't write the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter of any book
- what do you mean ?
- get it out of here !
get it out !
- take the book outside !
pierre , pierre , it 's all right
it 's ok , it 's all right
we have to get him to the hospital
go look in the back , there must be a whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row
we '@@ ii roll him to the car
the
the book is gone
are you sure ?
at dawn on a spring day in 15@@ 28 , a span@@ ish fle@@ et from cuba prepared to land an army of conquist@@ ad@@ ors on the sho@@ res of north america ,
they had come to find new lands of gold
it was thur@@ s@@ day the 14@@ th of april , 15@@ 28 , when they came as@@ hor@@ e .
the beginning of the most dis@@ astro@@ us of all the expedit@@ ions of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors , and yet one of the great epic stories in the history of the americ@@ as .
the span@@ ish had called this florida , the land of flowers ,
but they found a strange and evil country ,
that summer , over 300 conquist@@ ad@@ ors struggled through these sw@@ amp@@ s ,
their leader , pan@@ ph@@ ilo de nar@@ va@@ ez , was arro@@ g@@ ant and in@@ compet@@ ent ,
they had no interpre@@ ters , their food supp@@ lies ran out ,
and worse , they were picked off by host@@ ile trib@@ es ,
the last survi@@ vor@@ s of those nat@@ ive pe@@ op@@ les are still here , the semin@@ ole ,
they have fier@@ cel@@ y defen@@ ded their indepen@@ dence ever since ,
so you are the only nat@@ ive american people within the usa who never sub@@ mit@@ ted ...
right . the only tri@@ be to never sign a treat@@ y of sub@@ mission .
the elements of florida , a very , very good ally .
s@@ nak@@ es and al@@ lig@@ ators , europe@@ ans worried more about them .
again , these people had no knowledge of florida .
nar@@ va@@ ez had been lic@@ en@@ sed by the king of sp@@ ain to disco@@ ver and conqu@@ er florida ,
he hoped to find cities here with large populations and gold
instead , he found a poor lands@@ cape totally un@@ suit@@ able for colon@@ isation ,
but he pushed his army on further into the nightmare ,
" if only nar@@ va@@ ez had come here to se@@ ek the well-@@ being of the indi@@ ans , " one span@@ i@@ ard wrote , " and not to wa@@ de through their blood to gain il@@ l-@@ gotten wealth , "
but his capac@@ ities did not come up to his dreams ,
with au@@ tum@@ n coming on , the expedition was on the point of collap@@ se ,
hoping now just to save their lives , they struggled down to the sea below tal@@ lah@@ as@@ see ,
but there was no sign of their ships ,
the fle@@ et had given them up for dead
they 're star@@ ving , dis@@ il@@ lus@@ ion@@ ed , and nar@@ va@@ ez we@@ ighs up the situation .
he thinks the span@@ ish sett@@ lem@@ ents in mexico are only a few le@@ ag@@ ues down the coast .
in fact , they 're 1,000 miles .
so he deci@@ des to build bo@@ ats to escape .
and on the 22@@ nd of september , nearly 300 survi@@ vor@@ s set sa@@ il in five bar@@ ges .
( thunder )
in terrible weather , they tried to sa@@ il across the gul@@ f of mexico , past the mississippi ,
nar@@ va@@ ez himself was never seen again ,
we would know nothing of this story , but for the captain of one of the bar@@ ges , a young span@@ ish gentlem@@ an called a l@@ var nun@@ ez cabeza de v@@ aca ,
cabeza de v@@ aca wrote a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le account of his advent@@ ures and with it we set out to follow him across the gul@@ f of mexico , to find out which way wind and ti@@ de might have taken him that au@@ tum@@ n ,
he was coming out of this part of florida ,
the green arro@@ ws indic@@ ate the current and speed and , as you see , it gets pretty swift .
- along the mississippi delta .
- the arro@@ ws show the pre@@ domin@@ ant direction ?
the pre@@ domin@@ ant direction of the current .
0@@ c@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , a lot of fron@@ ts come through , push the wind off@@ shore and those tend to be very strong win@@ ds that 'll push off@@ shore .
the pre@@ domin@@ ant wind is from the sou@@ the@@ ast .
that 's interesting .
when they pass the mississippi mouth , they get caught up in a storm coming from the north that blo@@ ws them right out to sea and nearly dro@@ wns them , in fact .
" in the end , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" we commen@@ ded our@@ selves to god and the dang@@ ers of the sea ,
" and there was not a man among us who did not think that death was certain ,
" none of us had any idea of ha@@ vig@@ ation ,
" for six weeks we were lost , " eating rotten ma@@ ize , drinking sea water , which drove some men mad
" i was at the hel@@ m that night , i had prepared to die ,
" and then , in the darkness , we heard break@@ ers , " we were near land "
it was the 6@@ th of november , 15@@ 28 ,
at dawn , they came in@@ shore ,
but the boat cap@@ siz@@ ed in the sur@@ f ,
too weak to sw@@ im , some of the men were dro@@ wned
they found themselves on a wind@@ swept shore un@@ seen before by white men ,
gal@@ vest@@ on island , texas ,
how far up do you think they went ?
you know , given how weak he was , i don 't think he probably went much further than you 're going .
0@@ ne of them climbed an oak tree to see where they were ,
- i can see it !
i can see the bay !
- yeah .
i think they gues@@ sed the island was about half a league wide .
maybe a mile and a half or so . that would be about right , would it ?
- at the wi@@ dest point .
- yeah .
and then they could actually , on a good , clear day like today , see the main@@ land across the bay .
and you recogn@@ ise that you 're on an island .
but the island was in@@ habit@@ ed by kar@@ an@@ ka@@ wa indi@@ ans .
they were hunter ga@@ ther@@ ers and they only came here during the fall .
they usually left at the end of febru@@ ary and the beginning of march and would return to the main@@ land and ...
but this was what you might call their winter residence , like the new yor@@ kers go to florida .
" we had expected to be sacrific@@ ed , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" but when the indi@@ ans saw our mis@@ ery they sat down with us and began to we@@ ep , too ,
" those un@@ civil@@ ised , sav@@ age men were sorry , for us ,
" and they shared what little food they had "
you know , you look at all these great expedit@@ ions of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors and the terrible events that happened in the new world , piz@@ ar@@ ro and everything else .
and here is a story where the man beg@@ ins here on this spot
- to become the other , doesn 't he ?
- exactly .
and it 's the indi@@ ans who give him the first clue to this transformation , isn 't it ?
they cry for him and he realis@@ es the common human@@ ity , don 't you think ?
they saw people dest@@ itu@@ te , in pain .
they were moved by com@@ passion to help them and aid them in the process and so they saved cabeza de v@@ aca , to their own de@@ tr@@ iment .
it 's ...
- they were ex@@ termin@@ ated in the end . - they were .
the kar@@ an@@ ka@@ was began to die of european dis@@ eas@@ es that same winter ,
they van@@ ished for good in the course of the 18@@ th century ,
but they kept cabeza de v@@ aca alive with the food of the island
that 's raz@@ or sharp .
so there 's an oy@@ ster bed running all the way down this little in@@ let ?
yes , and there are places out here where there are oy@@ sters for several miles and , during low ti@@ de , they 're ex@@ posed , probably at the time when they har@@ vest@@ ed them .
i don 't know how many people they were trying to feed , but i wouldn 't star@@ ve .
the expedition had been scat@@ tered to the win@@ ds ,
the men from another bar@@ ge were s@@ laugh@@ tered by indi@@ ans up the coast , one group reduc@@ ed to eating their dead ship@@ mates ,
but cabeza de v@@ aca survi@@ ved on oy@@ sters and ro@@ ots ,
this plant ...
this is a cat@@ tail .
and this is probably what he was speaking of when he said that he was breaking those nut@@ s off to eat .
it is like a nut .
extraordin@@ ary .
it was easy pick@@ ings .
they could just walk out and pick it up and there are ac@@ res and ac@@ res of oy@@ sters that are ex@@ posed at low ti@@ de .
but of the 300 men who left florida , only four would survive ,
( tan@@ n@@ 0@@ y ) please do not walk or stand in front of any vehicle while the ves@@ sel is appro@@ aching ... ( michael ) the kar@@ an@@ ka@@ was were nom@@ adi@@ c , in the spring , they crossed over to the main@@ land
and they took cabeza de v@@ aca with them ,
they had thought him a superior man , but with no skil@@ ls , he was an extra mouth to feed and he became their slave ,
he was brut@@ ally treated , but they kept him alive ,
after five or six years of that life , cabeza de v@@ aca decided he 'd had enough .
it was time to escape .
not out to sea , but into the interior .
the interior of texas at that time was completely un@@ known to the outside world
but during those years , cabeza de v@@ aca had got to know many of the nom@@ adi@@ c trib@@ es who lived in@@ land
some of them he descri@@ bes for the first time ,
co@@ ahu@@ il@@ te@@ can@@ s , ton@@ ka@@ was , at@@ akap@@ an ,
but that was not all , he 'd also discovered that one of the co@@ ast@@ al trib@@ es had shel@@ tered three other survi@@ vor@@ s of the ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k , who were still alive ,
they met up and made their break for freedom ,
their plan was to walk 1,000 miles to mexico city ,
they couldn ' t go south because of host@@ ile trib@@ es ,
so they decided to walk to the pacific , but which way ?
it used to be thought that they took a northern route through new mexico and a ri@@ zona , down into span@@ ish mexico ,
but there 's another possibil@@ ity - that they crossed the rio grande near the sea and turned west inside mexico ,
the clu@@ es are in cabeza de v@@ aca 's book , 0@@ ne of the few copi@@ es to survive is in san marcos , and there i met don 0@@ l@@ sen ,
so this is an original copy of cabeza de v@@ aca 's story ?
yes , it is .
and the page we 're most interested in , in the research we did , is page 40 .
there are four physical clu@@ es , all that happen on the same page here .
there 's a mountain of seven le@@ ag@@ ues , which would be 20 or 21 miles long .
" una sierra de si@@ eta le@@ gu@@ as . " yes .
and the stones there were like scor@@ ia of hierro .
- iron s@@ lag . - iron s@@ lag .
down near the bottom of the page , he fin@@ ds some trees .
pin@@ es with pin@@ ones .
and there again you see the pin@@ ones .
and the words that really catch our eye down there are right there .
that means their sh@@ ells were very thin .
so this is a very particular kind of pine tree .
a very particular kind .
the other two clu@@ es are much harder .
he says , " they gave us many small s@@ acks of margar@@ ita and alcohol mol@@ ido . "
now , those are miner@@ als .
people before us have trans@@ lat@@ ed that word , or trans@@ cri@@ bed it , i should say , as margar@@ ita , which can mean pear@@ ls or pearl mica , which is abun@@ dant in the deser@@ ts of arizona and new mexico and they 've used this to support the northern route .
if you look clo@@ sely , do you see what i see ? that word is not margar@@ ita .
- the second r isn 't the same as the first r .
it has a descen@@ der down to the left which prin@@ ts very fain@@ tly .
you see it there ?
if you look clo@@ sely , you see it 's actually mar@@ ga@@ x@@ ita with an x .
mar@@ ga@@ x@@ ita .
what does that mean ?
- what that means is iron py@@ rites .
- iron py@@ rites .
so the span@@ i@@ ards walked into a land rich in miner@@ als , to follow them , we crossed the rio grande and entered the des@@ ol@@ ate lands@@ cape of hor@@ th@@ ern mexico ,
, searching for cabeza de v@@ aca 's route into un@@ known america , just over there .
( read@@ s span@@ ish ) " we mar@@ ched along , mountain range seven le@@ ag@@ ues long . "
they walked the whole length of this sierra in one day .
they were the first europe@@ ans to walk across the continent ,
they gave us the first account of the people here ,
but it 's never been trac@@ ed on the ground
maybe we can ask them about the pine trees .
do you want to roll your window down ?
( speak span@@ ish )
much of his story , is still mis@@ understood because we don 't know for sure what route he took ,
we 're looking for the pin@@ ones with very , very thin sh@@ ells .
if we knew his route , then his account might begin to reve@@ al a lost history , of these lands , and now , as then , local knowledge is all ,
- the old man knows about them .
- ( they speak span@@ ish )
muchas gracias .
gracias .
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
- so the old man knew about them ?
- yeah .
fantast@@ ic .
great .
we 're on the right track .
the old her@@ der had sent us on to a dri@@ ed-@@ up river bed and there were the pine trees ,
- so this is one of them ?
- yeah .
it 's amazing to think that paper shell pin@@ on was only identi@@ fied by science in 1979 .
and how easy to imagine the span@@ i@@ ards fe@@ ast@@ ing on the ker@@ nels ,
- there 's still some on the floor .
- yeah .
it was the best food they 'd had for days ,
- this year is not ... was not a good season .
- yeah ?
when they 're still green , you just grin@@ d them up , make a ball and eat them , if they 're dry , eat them with the sh@@ ells too ,
( cr@@ un@@ ching )
you see how thin it is .
that 's what cabeza de v@@ aca 's talking about .
that 's what the indi@@ ans here used as food along with the no@@ pal cac@@ ti that we passed on the way .
but to clin@@ ch his route , we needed to find his mountain of iron ,
the loc@@ als sent us up a place called mercado , the hill of wealth , 5,000 ... more than 5,000 feet up the mountain .
cabeza de v@@ aca says the people here smel@@ ted met@@ als ,
they gave him a worked co@@ pper bell ,
there are co@@ pper deposit@@ s here and there 's also a huge quar@@ ry ,
it 's golden brown with iron ore , stre@@ wn with py@@ rites and iron s@@ lag ,
so this whole v@@ ast excav@@ ation here has been done for the iron ?
yes , they 've dug out this , made the hole .
then some rocks have fallen in from the sides .
( michael ) some of the other clu@@ es you might be able to help on , as a ge@@ olog@@ ist .
they find something , which everybody ar@@ gues over .
they call it alcohol mol@@ ido , po@@ w@@ dered alcohol , which some people say could be st@@ ib@@ n@@ ite , lead sul@@ phi@@ de .
there 's also black mang@@ an@@ ese around the outside here .
it 's called py@@ rol@@ us@@ ite .
the indi@@ ans used it as paint .
and that 's exactly what cabeza de v@@ aca says ,
" a black po@@ w@@ der used by indian women to paint their faces , "
0@@ k .
i found it .
hey , we 've got some mang@@ an@@ ese here .
fantast@@ ic .
so you think this could be it ?
well , it 's the kind of mang@@ an@@ ese we call py@@ rol@@ us@@ ite and it sure comes off black .
wow .
brilli@@ ant .
i left mon@@ clo@@ va feeling sure cabeza de v@@ aca had come this way ,
he wasn 't moving through the nom@@ adi@@ c pe@@ op@@ les of central texas ,
he was among the settled commun@@ ities here in north mexico ,
people who lived in houses , worked met@@ als and had long-@@ distance trade ,
the anc@@ est@@ ors of today 's people ,
the next few weeks , he tells us , they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry pl@@ ains into bar@@ ren mountains ,
they were heading north@@ wards now , back up towards the rio grande , but they weren 't wander@@ ing aim@@ lessly ,
they spoke the langu@@ ages and moved from one community to another on ancient tra@@ ils , which now crossed and rec@@ ros@@ sed a great river ,
these tra@@ ils are marked on us military , ma@@ ps from the 185@@ 0s , 0@@ ne of them was called the great com@@ an@@ che trail ,
going back down into mexico , it met the rio grande at the grand indian cros@@ sing ,
these tra@@ ils can be thous@@ ands of years old , maybe even used by the first migr@@ ants over 12,000 years ago ,
we took an exper@@ t guide with us , linda walker , and team arche@@ olog@@ ist bob mal@@ lou@@ f .
and all along the trail , we found places where human be@@ ings had once lived
cabeza de v@@ aca 's journey had begun to reve@@ al the van@@ ished map of ancient america ,
the shel@@ tered part and it probably ran further out .
this is one of the better pic@@ to@@ graph sites that we 've come up to .
you can see that they 're all over this pan@@ el .
( b@@ 0@@ b ) those are beautiful pic@@ to@@ grap@@ hs .
late pre@@ histor@@ ic pic@@ to@@ grap@@ hs .
- what 's late pre@@ histor@@ ic ?
- 500 ad to as late as 1550 .
0@@ n the basis of art size .
we could still make out the finger marks of the artist@@ s ,
what are they de@@ pic@@ ting ?
this looks like something with legs .
uh , it ...
they 're difficult or impossible , as a rule , to interpre@@ t ac@@ cur@@ ately , although a lot of people try . 0@@ h .
so could any of these be religi@@ ous in signific@@ ance ?
we can probably assume that they prac@@ tis@@ ed certain kin@@ ds of sh@@ aman@@ ist@@ ic religion .
certainly with heal@@ ers and this sort of thing .
this was the kind of religion that cabeza de v@@ aca and his friends en@@ counter@@ ed along this route .
and they thought cabeza de v@@ aca was a sh@@ aman .
they went to him to become heal@@ ed and they would go to him just like people would go to a medical doctor today and it 's possible that could have saved their lives .
what 's the li@@ fest@@ yle of these people ?
- well , they 're ... - ( linda ) hard .
there wouldn 't have been great hospit@@ ality at the table in the evening .
( b@@ 0@@ b ) we have hard archa@@ e@@ ological evidence that they would eat just about anything they could get their hands on .
bob 's hard evidence came from the ancient human ex@@ cre@@ ment in the rub@@ bis@@ h dum@@ ps on these camp sites ,
when cabeza de v@@ aca said they were eating wor@@ ms and spid@@ ers , he wasn 't telling lies ,
the span@@ ish gentlem@@ an was ta@@ sting the life most humans had lived since the stone age ,
that night we found a camp@@ site over@@ looking the desert , , on the great pre@@ histor@@ ic route into central america ,
the place was an abandon@@ ed indian sett@@ lement ,
we found grin@@ ding hol@@ es , just as cabeza de v@@ aca descri@@ bes ,
these are probably 2,000 ... 3,000 bc to as late as 500 ad .
see they 're very tap@@ ered ... so you have a wooden po@@ under and pound the se@@ eds or whatever you used inside .
se@@ eds , mes@@ quite be@@ ans , things like that they would ground .
they would ground up in these and po@@ w@@ der them to make meal .
- wonderful .
- these are good ex@@ amp@@ les .
cabeza de v@@ aca says these hol@@ es were used to grin@@ d mes@@ quite be@@ ans to make the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gens for the indian ceremon@@ ies ,
he also descri@@ bes the way they cook@@ ed food
( linda ) look at that .
bo@@ iling the water with hot stones from the fire ,
that is hot .
i 've never seen that done .
- 0@@ oh .
- there we go .
so they do this because they don 't have ceram@@ ics .
they don 't have ...
they can 't put a pot on the fire to heat water .
probably because they moved about frequ@@ ently .
pot@@ ter@@ y is not very condu@@ ci@@ ve to a lot of movement in this country especially , because it 's so rocky and it 's easily broken .
- so where are the te@@ ab@@ ag@@ s ?
- come on .
- english breakfast or earl grey ?
- i don 't know .
( linda ) you guys are supposed to be the exper@@ ts on this , michael .
as cabeza de v@@ aca said , " how diverse and strange are human be@@ ings and their ways , "
the four men had now reached the very , middle of the continent , but did they still feel like conquist@@ ad@@ ors ?
did cabeza de v@@ aca , the gentlem@@ an ?
he had the chance to see this world before it was destroy@@ ed by the conquist@@ ad@@ ors and exploit@@ ers who followed but how much he leaves un@@ said
( linda ) some bur@@ rit@@ os ?
( michael ) yeah , that 'd be great , thanks .
0@@ ne thing that i keep wondering about as we 're trav@@ elling in the foot@@ steps of cabeza de v@@ aca is that he 's away for seven or eight years ...
you 've got some ?
great .
... and he tells us all sor@@ ts of fascin@@ ating things about the indi@@ ans , but he never spe@@ aks about his or any of his friends ' relation@@ ships with the women .
i don 't think he would have lived that long in a nat@@ ive society without having taken on a woman and i susp@@ ect it wasn 't one that was just a shor@@ t-@@ term scenario either .
it was probably the first in@@ fusion of span@@ ish blood into america .
you can bet he wouldn 't mention it , though .
it would have caused him problems with the church probably .
he had to write this to the audience that were now fe@@ eding him , which was sp@@ ain .
and he doesn 't want them to think that he just dit@@ ched span@@ ish val@@ ues and went nat@@ ive .
and went , " these val@@ ues that i was raised with i 've now decided are susp@@ ect . "
no , i don 't think he could do that , but i con@@ cu@@ r with you .
i think there was an un@@ written story there .
and so they continued , following the sun , across the rid@@ ges of the sierra madre ,
" though we could speak six indian langu@@ ages , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " we found 1,000 differ@@ ences in their ways of spe@@ ech ,
" but we were always understood and kept our authority with the indi@@ ans ,
" though still naked , she@@ d@@ ding our skin twice a year like s@@ nak@@ es , "
( linda ) this is a ten@@ aha .
this would hold water year round .
it can be anywhere as deep as ten feet , or as shal@@ low as a foot and a half , but there 's always water there .
- ( michael ) and it 's good water ?
- good water .
( trad@@ it@@ l@@ 0@@ nal f@@ 0@@ l@@ k music pl@@ ays ) and we finally reached the little town of san carlos ,
enrique .
hi . how are you ?
good to see you .
we finally made it .
- do you want a beer ?
- i 'd love one .
( s@@ ings in span@@ ish )
- a thr@@ ill .
- y@@ up .
you know what ?
it was sure fun .
it had been fun , but it had also told us more about cabeza de v@@ aca and the man he was becoming ,
something has happened to him .
he has been trans@@ formed somehow .
he is no long either an indian and he is no longer a span@@ i@@ ard and a christian .
he is a new man .
you speak of him as a man situ@@ ated in between those two cultures .
i suppose , in a sense , he 's the first modern man , in a way .
do you think ?
learned something that very few span@@ i@@ ards knew , that the indi@@ ans were human be@@ ings .
and many in sp@@ ain didn 't want human be@@ ings at that time .
they wanted slav@@ es .
everywhere on their journey now , they were treated as people with powers , people who could he@@ al ,
to we modern people , this is the least belie@@ v@@ able part of his story ,
and even in his day , he was acc@@ used of fantas@@ ising , and worse , claim@@ ing super@@ natural powers ,
" the indian heal@@ ers do their cu@@ res like this , " he says , " by blo@@ wing on the sick person and then using their hands to cast the ill@@ ness out ,
" we did the same , but with the sign of the cross , pr@@ aying to god to make them better , " and he did
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) this is the sac@@ red heart of jesus .
he appe@@ ars to me when i cure the sick .
0@@ h , and this , this is my protection against the evil spir@@ its who can harm me .
absolutely wonderful mix@@ ture of christian symbol@@ s and yet the way of working with them is much more tradition@@ al and mexic@@ an .
it tou@@ ches back to what was the religion of the whole of the americ@@ as in ancient times , this sort of sh@@ aman@@ ist@@ ic religion .
in a sense , cabeza de v@@ aca was the first person to try and cross the bo@@ undar@@ y between the two and use them both .
" it pleased god to give them health , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , as a 16@@ th-@@ century , man would
" in the future , " he wrote to the king of sp@@ ain , " these lands will be brought to the true faith , " and though my story , may be difficult to believe , i assure your majest@@ y it is the truth , "
and however we might explain it , thous@@ ands of indi@@ ans c@@ lung to them now , asking for their bles@@ s@@ ings , walking with them through the wil@@ dern@@ ess ,
the nat@@ ives were ast@@ on@@ ished that cabeza de v@@ aca and his friends could walk for a whole day without ne@@ eding food , " but by then , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " we were so in@@ ured to suff@@ ering that we felt no fat@@ ig@@ ue . "
their gu@@ ides now led them towards another great nat@@ ive trade route across the americ@@ as - the shell trail , which came down from the pueblos of a ri@@ zona and new mexico all the way to the pacific ,
" we saw many town@@ s now , " says cabeza de v@@ aca , " built by civil@@ ised people , "
they were near the ru@@ ined city of casas grandes ,
this ast@@ on@@ ishing place was once a centre of the shell trade ,
the archa@@ e@@ ologi@@ sts found a ton and a half of sh@@ ells in these ware@@ houses .
sh@@ ells for grin@@ ding up , for use as decor@@ ation on the face of the walls .
sh@@ ells for personal ador@@ n@@ ment , neck@@ lac@@ es , brac@@ el@@ ets .
sh@@ ells like the pink spon@@ dy@@ los , which was used for religi@@ ous ritu@@ als all the way along the pacific coast down to south america .
this place was abandon@@ ed a century before cabeza de v@@ aca 's day .
but the commerce and the trade routes on which it was carried still continued .
winter was coming on now as they climbed out of the pl@@ ains ,
their last hur@@ dle , the immen@@ se fis@@ su@@ red lands@@ cape around co@@ pper can@@ yon ,
0@@ ne of the big@@ gest nat@@ ive group@@ s in the americ@@ as still lives here , the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara ,
" the people here are the most open and intellig@@ ent folk i met , " says cabeza de v@@ aca ,
" their women more modest@@ ly and better dressed than in any other part of the indi@@ es we 'd seen , "
the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara are descen@@ dents of the pe@@ op@@ les who once spread all over the high pl@@ ains of hor@@ th@@ ern mexico ,
they have bor@@ rowed from the europe@@ ans only a hand@@ ful of use@@ ful things - the viol@@ in , the go@@ at , the apple tree and the metal plo@@ ugh@@ share ,
a p@@ low ...
there are no roads through their lands , you still have to go on foot ,
they call themselves the people who walk straight , and they mean in their hearts , as well as with their feet ,
by now cabeza de v@@ aca had seen the first signs of the span@@ ish presence , an indian wearing a sword hil@@ t as an am@@ ul@@ et ,
his world was not far off ,
this is where we 'll be sleeping tonight .
and jol@@ ly com@@ fy it looks , too .
he knew now he must leave the indian world
but however much he wanted to , he also knew that what he was leaving behind had true worth ,
reading his account , i think that he remained a christian gentlem@@ an ,
he still believed in the civil@@ ising mission of sp@@ ain , but he was no longer a conquist@@ ador ,
if you had to explain to somebody what it is about this life that is so good , what would the things be that they think are so val@@ u@@ able ?
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
he had understood that the pe@@ op@@ les of the americ@@ as were human , too ,
as the tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara would put it , cabeza de v@@ aca had learned to walk straight ,
he said , " what 's good about life is that there 's go@@ at shit .
" there 's go@@ at dro@@ pp@@ ings and that 's good , " because we put it on the land , so that the cor@@ n will be born to make tor@@ til@@ las with , " to make pin@@ ole with and to make tes@@ gu@@ ino with . "
i said , " why do you make tes@@ gu@@ ino ? " he says , " to have a fiesta . "
so that you can dance this special dance they do all night , so that god will bring water .
" why do you need water ? " he says , " so that the cor@@ n ... will be born . "
there 's the circle . if we kept asking , it would go round .
- fantast@@ ic .
- ( spe@@ aks tar@@ ah@@ um@@ ara dial@@ ect )
( b@@ 0@@ b ) they don 't walk straight any more .
so people like me , we don 't walk straight any more ?
he says , " not hardly at all .
sorry . "
but how would cabeza de v@@ aca use his knowledge on his return ?
the od@@ ys@@ sey of cabeza de v@@ aca was drawing to its close ,
that winter they came down forest@@ ed can@@ yon@@ s towards the pacific ,
after more than 2,000 miles , he was about to re@@ enter the world he 'd once known ,
" we came down into a wonderful lands@@ cape , " he says , " fer@@ tile with ri@@ vers , forest@@ s and fields ,
" nowhere in the world , in our eyes , could be so rich and beautiful ,
( calls 0@@ ut in span@@ ish )
cabeza de v@@ aca ran into span@@ ish slave h@@ unter@@ s ,
it 's a moment which has been por@@ tr@@ ayed in nov@@ els and films ,
( y@@ elling )
and so cabeza de v@@ aca met his old self the man he 'd been all those years before ,
they threaten@@ ed to ens@@ lave his indian compan@@ ions and to kill him , but he stood his ground and forced them to let him and his indi@@ ans go ,
and finally , nearly ten years after he left cuba , he walked like a ghost into the town of cul@@ i@@ acan , to the ast@@ on@@ ishment of the local span@@ ish colon@@ ists ,
they had been the first people to walk across the continent ,
they 'd seen things no out@@ si@@ der had ever seen ,
but there 's no happy ending to his story ,
when he got back to sp@@ ain , he argu@@ ed for ben@@ evol@@ ent rule in the americ@@ as ,
but he was ru@@ ined by his enem@@ ies and he died a pau@@ per , his only leg@@ acy , the book of his advent@@ ures ,
while he 'd been lost , the world had changed as never before ,
the conquist@@ ad@@ ors had carried their s@@ words from florida to chile ,
their bra@@ very , and their gre@@ ed had led them to lake tit@@ ic@@ aca and to the he@@ ights of ma@@ chu pic@@ chu ,
and the cost ?
ancient civil@@ is@@ ations over@@ thrown ,
tens of millions dead from european violence and disease , and the pl@@ under@@ ing of the natural world of the americ@@ as ,
( m@@ 0@@ n@@ ks chant@@ ing )
back in sp@@ ain , these events woke the conscience of the age and people now began to question the justice of conqu@@ est ,
all the great civil@@ is@@ ations had treated people not of their own col@@ our or cre@@ ed as alien ,
but now , in cathol@@ ic sp@@ ain , these assum@@ p@@ tions were question@@ ed did the indi@@ ans have human rights ?
what does it mean to be human ?
in 1550 , the king 's coun@@ sell@@ ors gathered here in valladolid to listen to two great figures of the age , the dominic@@ an las casas , speaking for the indi@@ ans , and the philosoph@@ er sepul@@ veda , for the mission of imperial sp@@ ain ,
this is where the debate was held .
it 's quite a moment in the history of the world .
the first time that princip@@ les of universal human rights and global justice were worked out took place here .
sepul@@ veda conclu@@ ded by saying this - that human be@@ ings are not equ@@ al , that some are superior to others and that the in@@ habitants of the new world were natural slav@@ es because they were barbar@@ ous and in@@ hum@@ ane .
" how can it be doub@@ ted that they have been just@@ ly con@@ quer@@ ed " by our most hum@@ ane nation , which excel@@ s in every kind of vir@@ tue ? "
las casas spoke second .
stag@@ ger@@ ed in , an enor@@ mous pile of docum@@ entation , 40 years of research .
the king 's coun@@ sell@@ ors ' ja@@ ws must have dropped .
must have thought he was going to talk for days and he did .
he talked for five days .
and the nu@@ b of his argument was this - that the con@@ quest@@ s in the new world were wrong and had to be stopped , that the only way was pe@@ ace@@ ful conversion through love and kind@@ ness .

the king listened he ordered a stop to the con@@ quest@@ s while the issue was debat@@ ed further ,
but he couldn ' t stop history , 0@@ n the ground , the con@@ quest@@ s continued , dri@@ ven , as ever , by the lust for gold
and what of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors themselves , the men who won the new world
what did they think , looking back ?
he died in ...
stuart ster@@ ling 's anc@@ est@@ or was one of them ,
he fought in the batt@@ les in peru , saw at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa dead , married an in@@ ca princess , but he had blood on his hands ,
he wrote this extraordin@@ ary document , which he ad@@ dressed to king philip ii .
0@@ n his death@@ bed , aged 78 , he ad@@ dressed to the king a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le confes@@ sion ,
" i , captain man@@ cio se@@ ir@@ ra de le@@ gu@@ iz@@ amo , make this my last will and testament .
" fir@@ st@@ ly , for the peace of my soul , i declare for many years now " i have wanted to speak to his cathol@@ ic majest@@ y , to king philip .
" i wish your majest@@ y to understand the motive that moves me to say this
" is the peace of my conscience , because of the guilt i share .
" for we have destroy@@ ed , by our evil de@@ eds , such a government as was enjoyed by these nat@@ ives " and now they have come to such a pass that these nat@@ ives , from doing no evil , " have changed to people who now do no good .
" and so i have un@@ bur@@ den@@ ed my conscience .
" there is nothing more i can do to alle@@ vi@@ ate these in@@ just@@ ices , other than by these words ,
" for i 'm the last to die of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors . "
in the winter of 1527 , a boat arrived at a lonely island off the pacific shore of south america ,
it had come to res@@ cue a rag@@ ged band of desper@@ ado@@ es who 'd been searching the un@@ known for lands of gold
their leader was an old conquist@@ ador called francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro still belie@@ ves that somewhere to the south there 's an un@@ discovered world .
but his men now have had enough of his prom@@ ises .
they just want to get out .
" he 's a but@@ cher , a sav@@ age !
get us off this hell@@ ish beach ! "
then piz@@ ar@@ ro gets up and he takes his sword and ... dra@@ ws a line in the sand .
" friends and com@@ ra@@ des , " he said , " this side of the line is danger , death , hunger , abandon@@ ment .
" this side of the line , comfort and safety .
" that side of the line , go back to panama and you 'll be poor .
" cross over this side and you 'll be rich beyond your wil@@ dest dreams . "
13 of them cross over - the glor@@ ious 13 , they called them .
they would particip@@ ate in one of the most amazing events in history - the conqu@@ est of an empire which until that moment was un@@ known to the whole world , the empire of the inc@@ as .
un@@ like the europe@@ ans , the inc@@ as still lived in sac@@ red time ,
for them , the sun was god and every , day they wor@@ shi@@ pped his first appearance from the bitter an@@ dean night ,
" and we thought this was the whole world , " said one of them ,
" for we knew of ho other , "
until the span@@ ish came ,
in 15@@ 32 , piz@@ ar@@ ro returned to peru with a small private army ,
with him were the survi@@ vor@@ s from his island , his hom@@ et@@ own friends and four of his brothers , as clo@@ se-@@ kn@@ it as a mafia clan ,
ahead of them lay a v@@ ast empire and the great in@@ ca himself at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
in november 15@@ 33 , after months of tre@@ k@@ king south ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro reached the foot of the andes ,
we set out to follow in his foot@@ steps ,
( he gre@@ ets her in span@@ ish )
at first , the local people fed the strang@@ ers ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro himself slept in their houses ,
i 'll be reason@@ ably comfortable !
i shouldn 't have imagined a mat@@ t@@ ress .
he taught span@@ ish to two indi@@ ans so he could conver@@ se in que@@ chua , the in@@ ca language ,
the span@@ ish gathered their first impres@@ sions of this great state and its people ,
" how ration@@ al the indi@@ ans are , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary ,
" the people seem very , obe@@ dient to their rul@@ ers , "
here , the span@@ i@@ ards ta@@ sted po@@ tat@@ o@@ es for the first time ,
along with more ex@@ otic dis@@ hes@@ l
there 's an old story that in ancient in@@ ca times , there was a period of fam@@ ine .
the people were star@@ ving .
they discovered this fur@@ ry ro@@ dent among the rocks .
it was good to eat and it saved them .
they only eat it for special festivals - religi@@ ous festivals and so on .
they 're doing it today because they 've got a foreign guest .
next day , we lo@@ aded up to follow piz@@ ar@@ ro into the andes ,
it 's an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able thought - piz@@ ar@@ ro had 62 horse and 102 foot plus some nat@@ ive allies from further up the coast .
he 's enter@@ ing an empire of five or ten million !
maybe if he knew , he would go back !
he hadn 't seen the in@@ ca army , had he ?
amazing .
amazing .
he 's a can@@ ny character , piz@@ ar@@ ro .
il@@ liter@@ ate , midd@@ le-@@ aged , tou@@ gh as old boots .
and very , very cle@@ ver .
he understood that the inc@@ as were a civil@@ isation that , for all its wonder@@ s , would be at the level of the bronze age and that with guns and toledo s@@ words he could strike where it really hurt .
the roads of the in@@ ca empire stretched 3,000 miles , from chile to ecuador ,
and this one led to the camp of the in@@ ca himself at the town of ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
" we followed a narrow ste@@ ep path , " the span@@ ish said , " straight up to the mountain pe@@ aks , "
it 's still there , with its in@@ ca steps ,
look at this !
is this in@@ ca , ricardo ?
nobody but the inc@@ as made this kind of work .
look .
i 've got the account of piz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary of their journey up this pass . he says how ste@@ ep the pass was .
when they got to the top , it was defen@@ ded by a fort@@ ress surrounded by stone walls , built on a hill with very ste@@ ep rocks on either side .
that 's it !
we 're on his tracks !
- almost nobody knows this place in peru .
- really ?
it 's amazing .
the span@@ i@@ ards were seeing things no out@@ si@@ der had ever seen ,
the last moments of a world un@@ touched since the dawn of history ,
after five days ' march over the mountains ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro came out above the town of ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
the camp@@ fi@@ res of the enemy that night were a terri@@ f@@ ying sight , the span@@ ish said .
" like a brilli@@ antly star@@ -@@ stud@@ ded sky . "
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's army , they rec@@ kon@@ ed , was 30,000 strong ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were on edge now ,
why had they been allowed to come on un@@ op@@ posed
were they walking into a trap ?
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's secre@@ tary , tells the tale ,
" few of us slept that night .
we just talked about what we should do .
" all were full of fear , for we were so few , and so deep into the land .
" and with no hope of res@@ cue . "
the in@@ ca , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa , was taking the waters at the hot springs outside the town , and it was here that the two worl@@ ds first met ,
the span@@ ish advan@@ ce party told a tah@@ u@@ al@@ pa that piz@@ ar@@ ro loved him de@@ arly and would fight for him against his enem@@ ies ,
" and he smiled , " said the span@@ ish ,
" as if he didn ' t think much of us , "
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa told them they could stay in the town ,
0@@ min@@ ously , when the span@@ ish entered the town , they found it empty ,
they occu@@ pied a building on the square and waited to see what the in@@ ca would do ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's sp@@ ies had been watching them all the way ,
his chief sp@@ y , apu , repor@@ ted back ,
we know , from several chron@@ ic@@ lers , what apu repor@@ ted .
he repor@@ ted to his boss the following .
- 0@@ ne , they are not gods .
- not gods ?
- the in@@ ca knew that .
- doesn 't mean the people knew that .
0@@ k ? " i have seen them , " said apu , " i have seen how they get tired . "
0@@ r sick . and a few of them died .
gods don 't die .
they don 't get sick .
but they decided a plan .
they said let 's kill them all except three of them , who are going to be ca@@ str@@ ated .
the hor@@ se-@@ break@@ er ,
- the iron man ...
- the black@@ smith ?
the guy who does the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es and the weap@@ on@@ ry .
and the bar@@ ber .
the hor@@ se-@@ break@@ er and the other one , of course , to estab@@ lis@@ h the caval@@ ry of at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa .
but the bar@@ ber because , apu said , " he knows something .
he has powers .
" i have seen the people lin@@ ing up in front of his tent .
" they 're tired , really mes@@ sed up .
" and when they come out , i have seen them re@@ juven@@ ated , " fresh , health , " and with their skin fresh as a baby 's but@@ t . "
yeah !
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa wanted to have piz@@ ar@@ ro for lunch .
but piz@@ ar@@ ro had him for breakfast !
down in the square , as the hours passed , the span@@ ish still waited
" and i tell you , " said one of them , " we were wet@@ ting our@@ selves in terror , "
at last , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa entered the square on the shoulders of his cour@@ tiers ,
he was around 30 , handsome and intellig@@ ent , the red royal tas@@ sel on his forehead and a sil@@ ky soft clo@@ ak made of the s@@ kins of vampire bat@@ s ,
it 's funny what people remember at such moments of high tension ,
the span@@ ish remembered the lil@@ ting song with which the people wel@@ com@@ ed him ,
it 's still sung today at festivals in the andes ,
( rhyth@@ mic chant )
piz@@ ar@@ ro watched with his cap@@ tains and his priest , val@@ verde ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa took his seat in the middle of the square ,
val@@ verde stepped forward with a cross and a pr@@ ayer book and made a spe@@ ech about christ and the po@@ pe .
he called upon the in@@ ca to abandon his fal@@ se religion and embr@@ ace christ .
" i follow my religion , " said at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa .
" the und@@ ying sun and the ancient gods of the inc@@ as .
" what is your authority for your religion ? " he said .
the priest held up his book .
" give it to me , " said at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
" so i may see if it spe@@ aks to me . "
he turned the pages carefully and then looked up .
" why does it say nothing to me ? " he said , and he threw the book on the floor .
that was what piz@@ ar@@ ro had been waiting for .
it was the moment on which his whole career had conver@@ ged .
it gave him his pre@@ text for war and he gave the order to attack .
from the por@@ ticos all around this square the span@@ ish came out and opened fire on the mas@@ ses of people crow@@ ded here .
in@@ ca st@@ icks and fans were no match for span@@ ish guns and steel ,
some said 6,000 people died that night ,
as the rain fell , the square ran red with blood
but at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa was cap@@ tured alive ,
they took him in ch@@ ains to a prison clo@@ se-@@ by ,
it 's still there ,
and now at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa made an ast@@ on@@ ishing offer - to ran@@ som himself
if they would set him free , he would fill the room with gold
0@@ n his desert island , had p iz@@ ar@@ ro ever imagined this ?
in his wil@@ dest dreams ? the story 's still told and re@@ told across the andes ,
but there are other in@@ ca versions of the story , 0@@ ne of them a unique manus@@ cript discovered only in the 20@@ th century ,
( man ) thank you very much .
this is it , the famous " nueva cron@@ ica y buen gobierno . "
it 's really excit@@ ing to be facing this document , a document which is unique .
because here , you not only see things that are val@@ u@@ able for the past , but also things that will help you to understand the present .
the auth@@ or , gu@@ aman p@@ oma , was a man of in@@ ca des@@ cent ,
( 0@@ ss@@ l@@ 0 ) this is the point of view of a van@@ qu@@ ished .
0@@ f one of those indi@@ ans who were con@@ quer@@ ed by the span@@ ish people .
he 's always insisted that the real o@@ wn@@ ers of the indian territor@@ ies are the indi@@ ans and the span@@ i@@ ards are the o@@ wn@@ ers of sp@@ ain .
and each one in their own real@@ m is perfect .
0@@ r@@ der is perfect .
but if the span@@ ish come here and pretend to be the o@@ wn@@ ers , then that is represent@@ ing the dis@@ order of the world .
the world is up@@ side down .
- ( w@@ 00@@ d ) the world is up@@ side down ?
- yeah .
to ga@@ ther the gold , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ordered his people to allow the span@@ ish to travel fre@@ ely through his empire ,
and the span@@ i@@ ards set out on the greatest pl@@ under@@ ing raid in history ,
so why did a tah@@ u@@ al@@ pa do it ?
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , the in@@ ca had never seen the strang@@ ers as a threat , now , he thought , if he deli@@ vered the gold as promised ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro would simply go away ,
" at that time , " says gu@@ aman p@@ oma , " we indi@@ ans lost all sense of direction , we forgot our gods " and lost the authority of our rul@@ ers , "
so piz@@ ar@@ ro 's men stri@@ pped the gold off the greatest shr@@ ines in the americ@@ as ,
at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa filled his ran@@ som room with seven ton@@ nes of it , one of the greatest tre@@ as@@ ures in all of history ,
he 'd kept his word but what would p iz@@ ar@@ ro do ?
piz@@ ar@@ ro put at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa on tri@@ al for tre@@ ason , the jury , - the piz@@ ar@@ ro brothers and their friends ,
the ver@@ dic@@ t - " the in@@ ca must die , "
" it was the most desp@@ ic@@ able thing we ever did in the americ@@ as , " said one conquist@@ ador ,
in the andes , the people have never forgotten ,
( he spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
corazon ?
the heart of a p@@ uma , si ?
they killed him like a llama .
for the inc@@ as , these events were almost beyond belief
this was a " pach@@ ac@@ uti " - the world turned up@@ side down ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro now mar@@ ched his army in trium@@ ph south , on the in@@ ca royal road , a thousand miles to the capital of the in@@ ca empire , cu@@ z@@ co ,
" 0@@ n november 15@@ th , 15@@ 33 ,
" we span@@ i@@ ards reached cu@@ z@@ co ,
" it was a won@@ dro@@ us thing to be@@ hold
" no prize ever equ@@ al@@ led this ,
" the streets were grand , " the pal@@ aces of fin@@ el@@ y-@@ join@@ ted stone blo@@ cks of great anti@@ qu@@ ity , "
it was the rich@@ est town in all the indi@@ es , fo@@ unded by the first in@@ ca and re@@ fo@@ unded in 15@@ 33 by francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
and so , at last , piz@@ ar@@ ro looked down on his prize ,
the city of the inc@@ as , with its great ceremon@@ ial square and the huge pal@@ aces of the in@@ ca royal clan@@ s ,
it was a turning point in the history , of the world
the in@@ ca believed this place was the nav@@ el of the earth .
it was the sac@@ red centre of the last of the civil@@ is@@ ations to ar@@ ise indepen@@ d@@ ently on the planet .
and the fall of the city to the span@@ ish , coming so soon after the fall of mexico , seems now like the beginning of the end for the tradition@@ al civil@@ is@@ ations of the world .
the end of sac@@ red time .
the trium@@ ph of pro@@ fan@@ e time .
for piz@@ ar@@ ro 's expedition was a profit - making vent@@ ure backed by the bank@@ ers of europe ,
from now on , across the atlantic , the talk was of ho@@ thing but peru and gold
europe was amaz@@ ed span@@ i@@ ards flo@@ o@@ ded into peru on a gold rush ,
the piz@@ ar@@ ro brothers fla@@ un@@ ted their new@@ -@@ found fortun@@ es ,
for them , these were days of wonder as they tightened their grip on the people and the riches of p er@@ u ,
to win hearts and min@@ ds , the piz@@ ar@@ ros ap@@ pointed a pu@@ pp@@ et king , at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa 's half-@@ brother man@@ co ,
but the span@@ i@@ ards treated him with con@@ tempt ,
to the inc@@ as ' horror , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro rap@@ ed man@@ co 's wife and took her for himself
word soon spread of a war of liberation ,
man@@ co sum@@ mon@@ ed his lead@@ ers to a secret meeting ,
perhaps it took place in the in@@ ca sun temple which still stands today inside a cu@@ z@@ co church ,
man@@ co 's words were recor@@ ded by his son tito c@@ usi ,
" i 've sum@@ mon@@ ed you all here , " said man@@ co , " because we all know now clearly who these fore@@ ign@@ ers really are .
" they 're not wor@@ thy people sent by god , " but children of the devil .
" we 've endu@@ red a thousand insul@@ ts , they treat us like dogs " while swe@@ aring to be our friends .
" now i want you to send your mes@@ sen@@ gers thro@@ ugh@@ out the whole country .
" sum@@ mon all your forces to ga@@ ther here in cu@@ z@@ co in 20 days ' time " to attack them .
" make sure the bear@@ ded ones hear nothing about this " and we 'll kill every last one of them .
" then , perhaps , we may wak@@ en from this nightmare . "
man@@ co 's plan was a concer@@ ted attack all over peru , above cu@@ z@@ co , a v@@ ast in@@ ca army gathered in the hills ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were surrounded cut off in lima , francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro sent fran@@ tic ple@@ as to mexico for help ,
three relief colum@@ ns were wiped out by man@@ co 's ar@@ mi@@ es , here in cu@@ z@@ co ,
span@@ ish surviv@@ al hung on whether they could take the in@@ ca fort@@ ress which control@@ led the city at sac@@ say@@ hu@@ aman ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were out@@ num@@ ber@@ ed and , at times , out@@ fought ,
juan piz@@ ar@@ ro was killed but in the end , the inc@@ as were out@@ gun@@ ned
the last battle for these walls was fought with a desperate hero@@ ism by the in@@ ca warriors .
like the az@@ tec battle for mexico city , it re@@ calls the great class@@ ical ep@@ ics like the " ili@@ ad , " the siege of troy .
the last of the great in@@ ca heroes , they say , stood on top of these rocks ar@@ med with a european sword , throwing the span@@ ish off , killing members of his own side if they thought of sur@@ ren@@ dering to the span@@ i@@ ards .
in the end , when it was clearly all ho@@ pel@@ ess , he threw his weapons down , stu@@ ffed his mouth with earth , s@@ cour@@ ged his face and threw himself off the rocks in ful@@ fil@@ ment of his vo@@ w that he would die rather than give in to the span@@ ish .
" and so our en@@ cir@@ clement was broken , " says gu@@ aman p@@ oma ,
" the span@@ i@@ ards had bought themselves a breathing space , "
the piz@@ ar@@ ros now took sav@@ age repr@@ is@@ als against the ci@@ vili@@ an population , the women and children who helped man@@ co 's army ,
a massive exo@@ dus followed as those who could f@@ led north into the sac@@ red valley ,
the sac@@ red valley was the in@@ ca heart@@ land
here they built their fin@@ est pal@@ aces with huge ter@@ rac@@ es to grow ma@@ ize and co@@ ca leaves ,
here , man@@ co and his high priest could call on the help of the anc@@ est@@ ors ,
at ma@@ chu pic@@ chu , the mum@@ mi@@ es of the dead inc@@ as could be brought out of their wom@@ b-@@ like cham@@ bers to gre@@ et the sun ,
their dead eyes reg@@ aled as in life with the vi@@ stas of the sac@@ red pe@@ aks ,
- ~ buenos dias !
- ~ buenos dias !
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , man@@ co built new ter@@ rac@@ es and houses here to feed and shel@@ ter the influ@@ x of tro@@ ops and refu@@ gees ,
you can still see them at 0@@ l@@ lant@@ ay@@ t@@ ambo , with its in@@ ca ho@@ using plo@@ ts and water chann@@ els ,
the inc@@ as bo@@ ast@@ ed that man@@ co had made this the strong@@ est fort@@ ress in all peru ,
and it was here that the piz@@ ar@@ ros laun@@ ched their next attack ,
they fought their way through the narrow lan@@ es of the town ,
then they att@@ acked the fort@@ ress which to@@ wers above ,
the span@@ i@@ ards now sent their force of command@@ os up to try and seize the rocks above the fort@@ ress .
her@@ n@@ ando piz@@ ar@@ ro led the as@@ sault up these steps while the inc@@ as rain@@ ed down mis@@ siles , spur@@ red on by man@@ co , who rode the ter@@ rac@@ es above on a span@@ ish horse ,
" suddenly , the indi@@ ans hit us from every , side ,
" to hear the ro@@ ar of their army ,
" it was as if the mountain was about to crash on top of us , "
for the first time , the span@@ ish had been be@@ aten in a pit@@ ched battle ,
" 0@@ ne more day and we would have killed them all , " said tito c@@ usi ,
" my father 's men laughed heart@@ ily at the span@@ ish ro@@ ut " and how we celebr@@ ated our victory , "
man@@ co planned to make a new cu@@ z@@ co here in the sac@@ red valley ,
he even built a great council chamber , car@@ ved with the royal pum@@ as ,
" by such monuments , he hoped to be remembered always , " said gu@@ aman p@@ oma ,
but man@@ co knew that span@@ ish colon@@ ists were pour@@ ing into peru every , month ,
within a year , man@@ co realis@@ ed he would have to pull right out of span@@ ish reach , to the jung@@ les the far side of the andes ,
peru would be partit@@ ion@@ ed
it must have been a heart@@ breaking moment for the young in@@ ca ,
when man@@ co had decided to re@@ treat up the valley into the jung@@ les of vil@@ cab@@ amba he made a spe@@ ech to his lo@@ yal fol@@ lo@@ wers .
a moving spe@@ ech , too , a little like bon@@ nie prince charlie going over the sea to sk@@ ye .
he asked them to remember his anc@@ est@@ ors , the inc@@ as of the past , had been good rul@@ ers , had cared for the people and provi@@ ded for them .
" don 't forget that , " he said .
" don 't let your children forget it . "
then he said these extraordin@@ ary words which are all the more strik@@ ing now .
" i know , " he said , " that one day , in the future , " the time will come when they will force us to wor@@ ship their gods .
" and when that day comes , " do what you have to do in front of them , but in private don 't forget our ceremon@@ ies " and our gods .
" and if they try to force you to destroy our shr@@ ines , " only reve@@ al what you have to and keep the rest hidden in your hearts . "
so the in@@ ca empire was to be divi@@ ded
man@@ co 's court and his army began their long march over the andes , demol@@ ishing the road behind them as they went , nearly 13@@ ,000 feet .
good lord !
no wonder my hands are fre@@ ez@@ ing cold !
but even now , the inc@@ as still dre@@ amed that one day they might return ,
0@@ n the far side of the mountains , man@@ co hoped to organise a new resistance , as man@@ co put it , " to free the land of our fore@@ fa@@ thers , "
man@@ co destroy@@ ed the rope bridge here , the river was to be the bo@@ undar@@ y , between the two worl@@ ds ,
but no one crossed the piz@@ ar@@ ros ,
gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro now prepared to hunt man@@ co down , man@@ co 's line of re@@ treat had led him to a remo@@ te jungle hide@@ away at vil@@ cab@@ amba , the lost city of the inc@@ as ,
with him , gonz@@ alo took 300 of the tou@@ gh@@ est conquist@@ ad@@ ors , more than his brother had led to ca@@ jam@@ arca ,
we set out to follow him ,
i 've now got fle@@ as . you may wonder why i 'm scrat@@ ching my hands .
i 've been bit@@ ten by the dre@@ aded " p@@ uma w@@ ac@@ achi " - which is the fly that makes even the p@@ uma cry !
- it 's got me all over . it 's true !
- p@@ uma w@@ ac@@ achi !
me w@@ ac@@ achi !
the first stage of our tre@@ k in piz@@ ar@@ ro 's foot@@ steps took us across ble@@ ak u@@ pl@@ ands over the last of the high passes towards amaz@@ onia ,
man@@ co had reti@@ red to the far@@ th@@ est corner of the in@@ ca world to cre@@ ate his new kingdom ,
( men enc@@ 0@@ ur@@ age h@@ 0@@ r@@ ses )
- is this the pass col@@ pa ?
- yes , this is col@@ pa pasa .
- the col@@ pa pasa ?
- yes .
- what does that mean ?
- that 's the high@@ est point on the trail .
i 'll catch you up in a minute .
the col@@ pa pass , the high pass .
about 12,@@ 400 feet .
this is the last of the passes before the road goes down and down and down towards the head@@ waters of the amazon and down into amaz@@ onia itself .
when the in@@ ca resistance headed this way , they were saying goodbye to their old hom@@ eland .
according to gu@@ aman p@@ oma , man@@ co had pushed new roads into the interior , and on the second day , we found them ,
- this looks like in@@ ca steps , yeah ?
- yes , it is in@@ ca steps .
they 're quite well pre@@ served up here .
yeah .
piz@@ ar@@ ro now s@@ cent@@ ed blood
" we can@@ not fa@@ il to get man@@ co now , " he said , " dead or alive , "
but piz@@ ar@@ ro was too confid@@ ent and he fell into man@@ co 's trap ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
don juven@@ al told us how the inc@@ as had rolled stones down on the span@@ i@@ ards ,
there are still pil@@ es of rocks up there ,
36 conquist@@ ad@@ ors were killed
gonz@@ alo was forced to re@@ treat and wait for rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements before he dar@@ ed push on ,
and man@@ co taun@@ ted him ,
" i am man@@ co in@@ ca ,
" we have killed 2,000 span@@ i@@ ards and we will kill you too , and free our country , "
the following day , we came down through the clouds into so@@ d@@ den rain@@ forest@@ s ,
in places , land@@ sli@@ des had taken the path away ,
such conditions must have s@@ apped the mor@@ ale even of p iz@@ ar@@ ro 's har@@ den@@ ed conquist@@ ad@@ ors ,
we came in sight of man@@ co 's lost city ,
- this is espiritu p@@ ampa ?
- espiritu p@@ ampa .
si .
there it is , the lost valley of the inc@@ as .
the site of their last city .
it 's so sec@@ lu@@ ded , so hidden , you can understand why it was never discovered until the 20@@ th century .
you can understand too why the last of the inc@@ as thought they might be safe here , hidden away from the rest of the world .
piz@@ ar@@ ro had had to fight his way this far , but when he got here , the city was empty ,
man@@ co had disappeared into the jungle ,
this is la plaza principal , don juven@@ al ?
si , plaza principal .
( d@@ 0@@ n juven@@ al spe@@ aks que@@ chua )
today , man@@ co 's city lies scat@@ tered over a square mile of forest , so chok@@ ed with veget@@ ation it takes time to make out the sha@@ pes of the buildings ,
it 's all on such a huge scale .
this is the ter@@ racing of the great plaza in the middle of the city on which stood the temple .
they brought all their most sac@@ red rel@@ ics here from cu@@ z@@ co - the mum@@ mi@@ es of the last of the dead inc@@ as , and above all the most sac@@ red reli@@ c , the golden image that symbol@@ ised the rising sun in whose chest was a heart made of dou@@ gh
they brought it all here to try to re@@ build their world in the jungle .
gonz@@ alo search@@ ed these forest@@ s for two months till s@@ ick@@ ness and star@@ v@@ ation forced him to re@@ treat ,
by his finger@@ nails , man@@ co had survi@@ ved
in his fury piz@@ ar@@ ro took reven@@ ge ,
he ordered man@@ co 's wife shot with arro@@ ws and flo@@ ated her down the river in a basket to be found by the inc@@ as ,
man@@ co was gri@@ ef@@ -@@ stric@@ ken for he had loved her very , much ,
mean@@ while , piz@@ ar@@ ro 's private empire began to fall apart ,
like all mafia famili@@ es , the piz@@ ar@@ ros had made bitter enem@@ ies ,
in a scene from " the god@@ father , " francisco , the disco@@ ver@@ er and con@@ quer@@ or of p er@@ u , was mur@@ dered by the son of his first business partner ,
man@@ co , mean@@ while , had made his new capital at a place called vit@@ cos ,
fantast@@ ic !
there 's the vil@@ cab@@ amba river .
the span@@ ish descri@@ bed the place as being on a high mountain with wonderful views over the province of vil@@ cab@@ amba .
0@@ n top , they say , was a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al flat area where majest@@ ic and sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous buildings had been erec@@ ted with great s@@ kill and art .
you can see their ru@@ ins even from this distance .
man@@ co held court here for seven years ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were now fighting among themselves and he shel@@ tered enem@@ ies of the piz@@ ar@@ ros ,
but there was a price on the in@@ ca 's head , and in the end they got him ,
this is all that re@@ mains of man@@ co 's palace .
here 's the fin@@ el@@ y-@@ sculp@@ ted lin@@ tels that the span@@ i@@ ards mentioned .
and here 's the plaza where it all happened .
man@@ co was about to play a game of qu@@ o@@ its with hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es with his span@@ ish gu@@ ests , a game he liked .
his son tito c@@ usi tells the story .
" my father was about to throw , " he said , " when one of the span@@ i@@ ards stab@@ bed him in the back .
" he tried to defend himself , but there were seven of them and he was un@@ ar@@ med .
" they stab@@ bed him and stab@@ bed him .
i wanted to defend him , " tito says , " but i was only nine years old .
" they turned on me and i was terri@@ fied and ran off into the bus@@ hes .
" though i was wo@@ unded in the leg , i escaped .
" but my father was killed . "
man@@ co had been the one in@@ ca who offered hope of long-@@ term resistance .
so the in@@ ca empire ended .
the polit@@ ical order was destroy@@ ed .
but things ex@@ ist at different level@@ s in history .
and em@@ pi@@ res are really just on the surface of history .
below them is a much deeper structure that last@@ s much longer - the long-@@ last@@ ing , ten@@ ac@@ ious , de@@ ep@@ -@@ ro@@ ot@@ ed culture of the people of a region , sha@@ ped by their lands@@ cape and clim@@ ate .
up here in the andes , the in@@ ca people survive and the belie@@ fs survive , just as man@@ co in@@ ca had said .
the people themselves did not forget .
nearly 500 years on , the people of the andes still rever@@ e the anc@@ estr@@ al spir@@ its of the inc@@ as ,
every june , they go up in their thous@@ ands onto the glac@@ iers of the sac@@ red mountains ,
just before dawn , at a breath@@ less 16@@ ,000 feet , they wor@@ ship the ice of q@@ oy@@ l@@ l@@ ur rit@@ i , the lord of the snow star ,
and after@@ wards , like their in@@ ca anc@@ est@@ ors , the people gre@@ et the rising sun ,
and then they sing the lil@@ ting song they sang to at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa all those years ago ,
" when the last in@@ ca is dead , " said old francisco piz@@ ar@@ ro , " the people will we@@ ary , of resistance " and take our part , "
" in the beginning , " said the az@@ tec@@ s , " the white men came in one boat , "
nearly 500 years ago ,
span@@ ish advent@@ ur@@ ers landed on a small island off the coast of mexico ,
it was the first contact between the civil@@ is@@ ations of the old world and the new ,
the pre@@ lu@@ de to one of the greatest events in history ,
it 's a story of almost incredi@@ ble en@@ dur@@ ance , hero@@ ism , gre@@ ed and brut@@ ality .
and all the more po@@ ignant today as we see its long-@@ term effec@@ ts un@@ fol@@ ding across the globe .
it 's known still in the americ@@ as as the conqu@@ est , the " conquista . "
and the lar@@ ger@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ life men who ach@@ ie@@ ved it are the con@@ quer@@ ors , the " conquist@@ ad@@ ors . "
" most migh@@ ty prince , " wrote her@@ nan cortes to the king of sp@@ ain ,
" let me begin at the beginning , we sa@@ iled our ships to the land called yuc@@ atan , "
cortes was a poor boy from a small town , train@@ ed in law , not war , but he had dreams ,
a self-@@ made man , he 'd finan@@ ced his own expedition - 11 ships , 500 soldiers ,
like colum@@ bus , he didn ' t know what lay ahead
he thought the land they could see beyond cuba was just islands , through which they could sa@@ il to china ,
it was april 1519 ,
gracias !
it 's hard for us to imagine the shock of the new for people of the 16@@ th century ,
for us , it would be like landing on another planet ,
to disco@@ ver that the new world also had great civil@@ is@@ ations , with law , writing and architecture , this was a revel@@ ation ,
" what ration@@ al be@@ ings live here ? " wrote cortes ,
" this is the best and rich@@ est land that ever there was , "
the a@@ we@@ -@@ struck conquist@@ ad@@ ors christ@@ ened one place " el gran ca@@ iro , "
cortes headed west to the tab@@ asco river , the fron@@ tier of the mayan and the az@@ tec@@ -@@ speaking worl@@ ds ,
still perhaps un@@ sure of his next move , he landed in frontera ,
the key to any close en@@ counter is language , but cortes couldn ' t talk to the az@@ tec@@ s ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
he 'd already found a span@@ ish sail@@ or who spoke mayan ,
then , here in frontera , he had his lucky break ,
cortes was given a slave girl by a local chief her name was mal@@ in@@ ali , but here in mexico everyone calls her " mal@@ in@@ che , "
mal@@ in@@ che spoke mayan and nah@@ u@@ at@@ l , the az@@ tec language , through her , he could talk to them ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) mal@@ in@@ che was treated well by the span@@ ish .
especially by cortes .
some say she fell ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly in love with him .
- afro@@ disi@@ aco , # si ?
- si .
yes , some say she was daz@@ z@@ led by the power of cortes .
and how she 's paid for it@@ l " trait@@ or , wh@@ ore , god@@ dess of death , "
for nearly 500 years , mexic@@ ans have argu@@ ed about mal@@ in@@ che and her relationship with cortes , but mal@@ in@@ che was the one who would lead cortes to his destiny ,
cortes sa@@ ils on up the coast , mal@@ in@@ che at his side ,
he ke@@ eps asking about gold and everywhere they tell him of a myster@@ ious empire in the interior ,
a land called mexico ,
he anch@@ ors at an island off the coast , " the isle of sacrific@@ es , " , just off the modern port of vera cruz ,
and it was here that cortes had his first en@@ counter with the az@@ tec@@ s ,
in his letters , you can still feel his sense of wonder ,
since then , the tale has become a my@@ th , it 's even im@@ mortal@@ ised in the movies ,
0@@ n e@@ aster saturday 1519 , a magn@@ ific@@ ent em@@ bas@@ sy arrived from the r@@ uler of mexico ,
even more strange , they seemed to have been expecting cortes ,
dona marina , find out who hon@@ ours us in this royal manner .
yes , my lord .
( they speak nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
mal@@ in@@ che trans@@ lat@@ es their nah@@ u@@ at@@ l ,
tell the royal amb@@ ass@@ ador i am pleased to welcome him to my camp .
to his amaz@@ ement , the az@@ tec@@ s offer him wonderful gif@@ ts of gold
though cortes was preten@@ ding to be the amb@@ ass@@ ador of a great king , he couldn 't respond in kind and as gif@@ ts to the az@@ tec@@ s , he scrap@@ ed up a chair , some trin@@ kets and a velvet cap which their amb@@ ass@@ ador accepted , though he looked at them as if they were ex@@ cre@@ ment !
then came the cru@@ cial moment in the conversation .
" do you have more gold ? " says cortes .
" because we suff@@ er from a disease of the heart that can only be cu@@ red by gold . "
" yes , we do , " said the amb@@ ass@@ ador .
there could hardly have been a more dangerous ad@@ mission .
cortes now gave the az@@ tec@@ s a show of his power ,
he fired his guns , rode his horses down the shore ,
the az@@ tec@@ s were stun@@ ned they 'd never seen such things before ,
their amb@@ ass@@ ador had his artist@@ s paint them , as we would take photo@@ grap@@ hs ,
" the strang@@ ers , " he said , " have st@@ icks which spur@@ t fire ,
" they ride de@@ er , high as a house , which snor@@ t and fo@@ am , "
cortes was invit@@ ed to make a camp , he built a base here at villa rica ,
you can see it all from here .
the little bay , the little head@@ land where they built their fort .
tiny , isn 't it ? just a first en@@ clave in the new world .
but it all started from here .
and perhaps it was only now that cortes dre@@ amed up the plan to go to the city of the az@@ tec@@ s ,
could he somehow get them to bow to sp@@ ain ?
those nights by the sea , the loc@@ als told him of what lay ahead
how the az@@ tec empire was built on fear and tribu@@ te ,
a tribu@@ te not only of things , but of people , 0@@ f human hearts ,
the name of the az@@ tec r@@ uler was monte@@ z@@ uma ,
but monte@@ z@@ uma was haun@@ ted by a proph@@ ec@@ y , a legend of an ex@@ iled god who one day would return to rec@@ la@@ im his thr@@ one ,
so the az@@ tec sp@@ ies ur@@ gently looked for signs ,
the strang@@ ers ' white food was it food of the gods ?
their pale faces , could they be divine ?
it sounds incredi@@ ble , and it probably sounded incredi@@ ble to the span@@ ish , but az@@ tec gods weren 't like christian ones .
they were more like the gods of the ancient gre@@ eks , cap@@ r@@ icious , wil@@ ful , mercur@@ ial , cruel .
and the most enig@@ mat@@ ic of them all was quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l .
and according to the legend , when quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l was ex@@ pel@@ led from mexico , he promised that one day he would return and reg@@ ain his kingdom .
that he 'd come back across that sea out to the east , back here , with his chal@@ ky white face and his be@@ ard in the az@@ tec year 1-@@ reed .
by an amazing chance , 52 to 1 chance this was that year !
and for the az@@ tec@@ s , nothing happened by chance ,
cortes 's men are getting nervous now , they know a great empire lies in@@ land , and they know cortes wants to go there ,
he acts fast , kil@@ ls the ring@@ leader , then , so no one can get away , he deci@@ des to pull his ships up on the beach and scu@@ pper them ,
it 's a gamb@@ ler 's throw , isn 't it , dest@@ ro@@ ying your own ships !
they won 't talk about going home any more .
typ@@ ical piece of cortes .
he knows what he needs to know about the az@@ tec@@ s .
but to persu@@ ade his men into the interior , he needs to hit@@ ch them to his dreams .
to leave them , as he put it , with nothing to rely on but their own hands and the assur@@ ance that they must either conqu@@ er or die .
the hes@@ itation was over , cortes heads in@@ land with some nat@@ ive allies from the coast who were ke@@ en to throw off the az@@ tec yo@@ ke ,
he took a back road towards monte@@ z@@ uma 's capital , ten@@ och@@ tit@@ lan , hoping along the way to find friends among monte@@ z@@ uma 's enem@@ ies ,
the town@@ s they came through are still here - co@@ at@@ ap@@ ec , x@@ ico ,
" every place we passed through , " says the conquist@@ ador bern@@ al diaz , " we saw altar@@ s for human sacrif@@ ice , by some , there were thous@@ ands of skul@@ ls , "
the christian in cortes was revol@@ ted
here in x@@ ico , he told the people they must give up their id@@ ols ,
speaking in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l , the az@@ tec language ,
mal@@ in@@ che gave a pot@@ ted history of christian@@ ity .
then she explained to the people the po@@ pe gave the king of sp@@ ain authority over their lands in the name of god .
there 's a story that two chie@@ fs who heard this were prepared to believe that there was one all-@@ powerful god , but as for the idea that the po@@ pe had given their lands to somebody else , the po@@ pe must have been drunk !
the span@@ i@@ ards were still trying to make sense of confus@@ ing signs ,
the sten@@ ch oo blood ming@@ led with the scent of flowers ,
familiar european categories of life and death , nur@@ ture and fe@@ eding , were up@@ side - down ,
to qu@@ en@@ ch their thir@@ st , the span@@ i@@ ards were given ju@@ ice bled from the fles@@ hy white heart of the mage c@@ actus ,
wow ! it 's absolutely beautiful .
0@@ n@@ ly to learn this was the drink given to sacrific@@ ial victi@@ ms to dul@@ l the senses of those who were about to die ,
" every , day , " says bern@@ al diaz , " we were told they 'd kill us " and eat our flesh with chil@@ lies , " and the warm drink made from the cac@@ ao bean ,
" was prepared for the eagle warriors who fe@@ ast@@ ed on the flesh of their enem@@ ies , "
wh@@ il@@ st human sacrif@@ ice is long gone , chocolate is still drunk here at religi@@ ous fe@@ asts ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
that 's " bu@@ enas tar@@ des " ?
how do you say " gracias " ?
( she trans@@ lat@@ es t@@ 0 nah@@ u@@ at@@ l )
amazing !
and with the language , hin@@ ts of az@@ tec att@@ itudes to love and sex ,
for all their ob@@ session with death , the az@@ tec@@ s still loved life ,
( in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l ) we 'd better not ... ( he repe@@ ats her w@@ 0@@ r@@ ds )
i can 't tell you what that means !
cortes pushed on , and now we had to follow him on foot ,
" ahead of us , " says cortes , " we saw a great range oo beautiful mountains , " the pe@@ aks so white we think they must be covered with snow , "
with him , cortes had 300 conquist@@ ad@@ ors , 40 of them cross@@ bow@@ men , 20 mus@@ ket@@ e@@ ers ,
there were several hundred indi@@ ans , and cu@@ ban serv@@ ants , and , of course , his preci@@ ous horses - 15 of them ,
after a summer on the car@@ ib@@ bean coast , the span@@ i@@ ards were in for a shock ,
0@@ ne of the conquist@@ ad@@ ors , bern@@ al diaz , said when they came into the mountains , it rain@@ ed and rain@@ ed .
the path turned into tor@@ r@@ ents .
all they had was their cot@@ ton arm@@ our for the trop@@ ics .
they were un@@ prepared for the change of temperature , going up 11,@@ 000 feet .
so@@ aking wet and fre@@ ez@@ ing cold , some of their indian serv@@ ants died .
so far as we know , cortes had no military , training , but he never lost the respect of those who mar@@ ched with him ,
the thing you have to remember about the conquist@@ ad@@ ors is that , putting themselves through this , they were all volun@@ te@@ ers .
they were in it not for religion but a share of the prof@@ its .
they were free men .
they acknow@@ led@@ ged their leader 's authority but he had to pay attention to and respect them .
and they called each other " comp@@ ad@@ re . "
com@@ rade .
they 're all in it together .
- is that the path up here ?
- eh ?
- that 's the path , is it ?
- yes .
that little path up to the top ,
cortes called it " nombre de dios " - " the name of god . "
( rain dr@@ 0@@ wns 0@@ ut w@@ 0@@ r@@ ds ) 13@@ ,000 feet !
can 't see ...
~ muchas gracias !
those nights , the nat@@ ive women he 'd brought from the coast made them tor@@ til@@ las ,
some compen@@ sation ,
we have t@@ ents tonight and we are certainly going to be so@@ aking , cold and miser@@ able , just as her@@ nan cortes and his men were , as bern@@ al diaz tells the story .
those clouds are not going to lift .
as they mar@@ ched deeper in@@ land , they heard more about what lay ahead
" the loc@@ als said that to capture mexico would be impossible , " says bern@@ al diaz , " and we would all die , " but the more they told us that , the more we lon@@ ged to try , our fortune , "
after the mountains , though , things got no better ,
through au@@ tum@@ n ha@@ il@@ stor@@ ms , they tre@@ k@@ ked across a des@@ ol@@ ate plain of salt lak@@ es with no food or water ,
cortes was heading for the fer@@ tile land of t@@ lax@@ cala ,
t@@ lax@@ cala was an independent city state ,
they hated the az@@ tec@@ s ,
cortes was hoping they 'd shel@@ ter him , but his luck was out ,
they att@@ acked him in a sav@@ age battle , 0@@ n the battle@@ field , they still plo@@ ugh up the de@@ bris ,
- buenos dias .
- buenos dias .
est@@ oy bus@@ cando la ruta de her@@ nan cortes .
# la batalla ?
# es aqui ?
ah !
~ si , si , si !
looks like glass , but this is ob@@ si@@ dian .
see the sharp edge ?
they had a row of these things set into the wood of the clubs that they used .
nast@@ y wound , but nothing like span@@ ish steel .
" there were 149@@ ,000 of them , " cortes wrote to the king , in julius caesar mode ,
it was touch and go , he hung on grim@@ ly on this little hill for two weeks ,
then , with their own los@@ ses moun@@ ting to the span@@ ish guns , the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans offered him a deal ,
they wel@@ com@@ ed him to their town and laid on a fiesta , even offered their daugh@@ ters in marriage ,
the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans had realis@@ ed that these strang@@ ers with their guns could help free them from the az@@ tec@@ s ,
ever since , they 've been acc@@ used by other mexic@@ ans oo betr@@ aying their country , but of course , that 's not how they see it ,
( man spe@@ aks in span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) x@@ ico@@ ten@@ cat@@ l , the el@@ der , re@@ aches for her@@ nan cortes who re@@ turns the embr@@ ace , but doesn 't let go of his sword .
the old x@@ ico@@ ten@@ cat@@ l knew the future of his people was at st@@ ake .
he believed this alliance would en@@ sure that t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans would not dis@@ appear from the map , would not dis@@ appear from history .
the alliance of the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans is the turning point of the whole story , the turning point in the history of the new world .
with them , cortes found allies who hated the az@@ tec@@ s and would fight them to the death .
allies who would give him support , provis@@ ions and man@@ power .
the possibil@@ ity of con@@ quer@@ ing mexico was now on .
so cortes mar@@ ched on , with several thousand t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an warriors behind him ,
to the greatest pil@@ grim@@ age city in the americ@@ as , chol@@ ula , under the vol@@ cano popo@@ cat@@ ep@@ et@@ l ,
these were friends of the az@@ tec r@@ uler monte@@ z@@ uma , and the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans warned cortes to expect trouble ,
as the span@@ ish moved through the town , they saw road@@ blo@@ cks in the side streets .
pil@@ es of stones he@@ ap@@ ed on the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps , women and children evacu@@ ated .
then mal@@ in@@ che heard a story that a p@@ lot was being hat@@ ched to amb@@ us@@ h cortes .
he decided on a pre-@@ emp@@ tive strike .
he sum@@ mon@@ ed the 100 lor@@ ds of chol@@ ula to meet him in the temple of quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l - it 's now the church of san gabriel - and there mal@@ in@@ che told them in nah@@ u@@ at@@ l that they 'd commit@@ ted tre@@ ason and they 'd die .
the doors were closed .
the span@@ i@@ ards killed them all .
and they killed 3,000 more chol@@ ul@@ ans assem@@ bled outside .
then their t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an allies s@@ acked the town .
" and so death came to chol@@ ula , " says the az@@ tec account ,
" when we got the news , we were se@@ ized with fear ,
" it was as if the earth itself were shaking , "
" my heart bur@@ ns as if it ' s been washed in chil@@ lies , " said monte@@ z@@ uma ,
from chol@@ ula , cortes continued up the old track through the forest@@ s of p opo@@ cat@@ ep@@ et@@ l ,
it was erup@@ ting then , as it is now ,
into the valley of mexico ,
in the distant ha@@ ze , they began to make out a v@@ ast blue lake , and then , at last , far away , approached on immen@@ se ca@@ use@@ ways , was the city of cortes ' dreams ,
" it seemed like an en@@ chant@@ ed vision , " wrote one of his men ,
" indeed , some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream ,
" it was so wonderful " that i do not know how to describe this first glim@@ pse " of things never heard of seen or dre@@ amed oo before ,
" the city had trad@@ ers and warriors , pri@@ ests and law@@ yers , " mus@@ ici@@ ans , jug@@ g@@ lers , cour@@ tes@@ ans and scri@@ bes ,
" it was the most beautiful thing in the world , " wrote cortes ,
believe it or not , that 's where the ca@@ use@@ way came in in the 16@@ th century !
this is where the lake ended and the city began .
this is where cortes walked that november 1519 .
the az@@ tec city started here .
to find the place where cortes and monte@@ z@@ uma met , you have to go right into the commercial heart of modern mexico city ,
the site today is inside the hospital of jesus ,
to get there , you have to go through accident and emergen@@ cy@@ l
the az@@ tec@@ s led the span@@ ish into a great cour@@ t@@ yard fr@@ amed by a beautiful building that was on this spot .
the tale of that moment@@ ous meeting is told by the az@@ tec ey@@ e-@@ wit@@ nes@@ ses ,
this is where the two worl@@ ds met .
it 's where monte@@ z@@ uma ad@@ dressed cortes .
" 0@@ h , my lord , " he said ,
" you are fat@@ igu@@ ed , you are we@@ ary after your long journey .
" at last you have come down to earth .
" you have come to your city of mexico which i have guar@@ ded for you for a little while .
" they said you would return , and now you have done so .
" but first , go to your palace and rest .
" and go in peace . "
myster@@ ious words , but what do they mean ?
was this the language of az@@ tec diplom@@ acy ?
0@@ r monte@@ z@@ uma 's accep@@ tan@@ ce of destiny ?
no one knows ,
but in the az@@ tec calend@@ ar , that day , the 8@@ th of november , was 1-@@ wind , the day of quet@@ zal@@ co@@ at@@ l , a day of rob@@ ber@@ y viol@@ ation and dece@@ it ,
and the az@@ tec@@ s knew that nothing ever happened by chance ,
" it was as if we 'd all e@@ aten stu@@ pe@@ f@@ ying mus@@ h@@ rooms , " say the az@@ tec wit@@ nes@@ ses ,
" we kept our children off the streets and the city went to sleep
" in a fe@@ ar@@ ful slum@@ ber , "
the city woke as it always had
in the streets of the modern world , we can only dim@@ ly imagine its splen@@ d@@ our ,
the flu@@ tes and con@@ ch sh@@ ells gre@@ eting the dawn , the bust@@ le of mer@@ ch@@ ants , the thous@@ ands oo blo@@ oms carried each day to mark@@ ets dren@@ ched in the sc@@ ents of the americ@@ as ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were op@@ en-@@ mou@@ thed at the sig@@ h@@ ts , the gle@@ aming st@@ uc@@ co of the pal@@ aces and pyram@@ ids ,
they wander@@ ed the cour@@ t@@ yards , ga@@ w@@ ped at strange gods ,
but on the wind , with the scent of flowers , they caught the ever@@ -@@ present smell of death ,
and in their hearts , they fe@@ ared that cortes the gamb@@ ler had led them into the ja@@ ws of hell ,
monte@@ z@@ uma , though , was still un@@ sure who cortes was , and who his master was , the great king charles across the sea ,
so now monte@@ z@@ uma pro@@ udly shows cortes the pyram@@ id of the war god on whose sum@@ mit thous@@ ands of cap@@ tives had had their hearts cut out , perhaps the gods would recogn@@ ise each other ?
trying hard to appear calm , the span@@ i@@ ards entered the chamber ,
the first thing the span@@ ish noticed when they came inside was the dis@@ gust@@ ing smell .
as their eyes got used to the darkness , they saw the eyes of the az@@ tec gods staring at them , gle@@ aming with preci@@ ous stones .
the war god , hu@@ itz@@ ilo@@ po@@ cht@@ li , was sitting down with a golden bow and arrow .
in front of him was a braz@@ ier full of human hearts , still warm .
all around , the walls were en@@ cr@@ ust@@ ed with dri@@ ed blood .
cortes then said this to monte@@ z@@ uma -
" i don 't understand how a prince as great as you " and a man as intellig@@ ent as you , could think that these are gods .
" they are bad things called de@@ vil@@ s " and i 'd like your per@@ mission to put a cross and a picture of the virgin mary in here . "
monte@@ z@@ uma took off@@ ence at that .
" if i thought you were going to be so insul@@ ting to our gods , " i would never have brought you to see them .
" we hold these things to be good .
" they bring us health , har@@ v@@ est , rain and water " and we must sacrif@@ ice to them .
" so please don 't mention this again . "
it was quite a gul@@ f
for the christ@@ ians , god gave his blood to rede@@ em man@@ kind
for the az@@ tec@@ s , man@@ kind must give its blood to rede@@ em the gods ,
a week passed cortes had to act ,
he ra@@ ises the st@@ akes with an un@@ belie@@ v@@ able gamb@@ le ,
at gun@@ point he arrest@@ s monte@@ z@@ uma ,
" what we want you to do is to come over to the palace where we 're lo@@ d@@ ging .
" quietly and with no fus@@ s .
if you raise the alarm , we will kill you . "
monte@@ z@@ uma is amaz@@ ed .
nothing he learned in the palace of nobles prepared him for this .
" my person can@@ not be taken prison@@ er , " he says to cortes .
" even if i were to like it , my people would never accept it . "
the argument goes on for four hours , monte@@ z@@ uma in tears at one point .
all the while , cortes 's cap@@ tains are pac@@ ing up and down , getting more and more nervous .
0@@ ne of them says , " either he comes with us now or we kill him now . "
and when mal@@ in@@ che trans@@ lat@@ es that , monte@@ z@@ uma c@@ aves in .
monte@@ z@@ uma was now in cortes ' power , maybe under his spell ,
he continued to issue orders as if things were normal , but he 'd lost the trust of his people ,
the tale has been told many times ,
how the angry , mo@@ b besie@@ ged the span@@ ish , how cortes bul@@ lied poor broken monte@@ z@@ uma to ple@@ ad with them ,
but monte@@ z@@ uma 's aura had dra@@ ined away and his people killed him ,
the span@@ i@@ ards were tr@@ apped inside the city , food and water cut off ,
his dream sli@@ pping from his gras@@ p , cortes was forced to give the order to escape ,
you have to remember the city was on an island completely surrounded by water , lin@@ ked to the main@@ land only by three great ca@@ use@@ ways .
all the brid@@ ges had been broken by the az@@ tec@@ s .
so in those final few hours , the span@@ i@@ ards built a port@@ able wooden bridge out of the ceiling be@@ ams of where they were staying .
they would leave at midnight .
the night was clear , with a gentle rain ,
the span@@ i@@ ards mar@@ ched in silence , hug@@ ging their gold
half-@@ way into the lake , they were spotted
the alarm was raised and the city woke ,
cortes was tr@@ apped the az@@ tec wit@@ nes@@ ses name the place , today it 's by the little post office on the tac@@ uba road
three quar@@ ters of the span@@ i@@ ards were left behind - 800 men - killed , dro@@ wned or cap@@ tured .
the cap@@ tives could expect only one fate at the hands of the en@@ rag@@ ed az@@ tec@@ s .
they were taken back into the city to the great pyram@@ id .
there their hearts were cut out and offered to hu@@ itz@@ ilo@@ po@@ cht@@ li , the god of war .
0@@ n the far shore , cortes gathered the survi@@ vor@@ s by a huge ce@@ iba tree , it 's still there ,
mal@@ in@@ che , they say , showed no emotion ,
but cortes , for once , couldn ' t control his feelings ,
they said there were tears in cortes ' eyes that night , " the night of tears . "
but of all his com@@ ra@@ des who died , he asked after only one -
martin lopez , the ship@@ buil@@ der .
when cortes heard that lopez had survi@@ ved , although badly wo@@ unded , he said , " v@@ amos .
que nada nos falta . "
" 0@@ k , let 's go . for we lack nothing . "
" and when the span@@ i@@ ards had thus gone , " say the az@@ tec@@ s ,
" we thought they had gone for ever and would never return , "
but across the mountains , the t@@ lax@@ cal@@ ans stood by cortes ,
and what he does now is one of the most amazing things in history ,
in the middle of the land , he buil@@ ds a fle@@ et ,
that 's why he needed martin lopez ,
they 're going to build 13 brig@@ ant@@ ines .
all of them are more than 40 feet long .
then they 'll take them to bits and carry them to mexico city !
what does the maestro think about this ?
( trans@@ lat@@ l@@ 0@@ n ) they dis@@ assem@@ bled the fle@@ et as there are no navig@@ able ri@@ vers round here .
for mexic@@ ans , cortes was a very cruel man .
but from a buc@@ can@@ e@@ ering point of view , he was great !
cortes would not let go of his dream ,
and now , in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably , the net began to tigh@@ ten around the az@@ tec@@ s ,
cortes transports his pre@@ fabric@@ ated fle@@ et , carried in pieces by a train of 8,000 t@@ lax@@ cal@@ an por@@ ters ,
across the mountains and back to the lake ,
0@@ n the lake shore , he waited , rein@@ forced now by thous@@ ands of hat@@ ive allies ,
it was may 1521 ,
cortes ' moment of destiny had arrived
it was to be nothing less than a war of the worl@@ ds ,
cortes ' plan was to lay siege to the city and cut off its food and water supp@@ lies , then , suppor@@ ted by his ships , he would attack it along the ca@@ use@@ ways , whose line is still marked today by the main routes into the city ,
it was a new kind of war@@ fare for the mexic@@ ans , invol@@ ving the ordin@@ ary population , women and children , star@@ ving them .
this wasn 't part of war in ancient mexico , but cortes was a modern man .
it was total war , the siege last@@ ed for 80 days ,
a quar@@ ter of a million people were reduc@@ ed to eating li@@ zar@@ ds and grass ,
devast@@ ated by european dis@@ eas@@ es , the az@@ tec@@ s under their new king , cu@@ au@@ h@@ tem@@ oc , still refused to nego@@ ti@@ ate and the span@@ ish had to win the city street by street ,
in the last battle , the az@@ tec@@ s were squ@@ as@@ hed into the warren of streets round the great pyram@@ id in the north , in t@@ lat@@ el@@ ol@@ co ,
i 'm looking for the ancient barrios of mexico city , not the modern ones .
i want to go to the area of tep@@ ito .
- tep@@ ito ?
- yeah . do you know it ?
yes , but it 's a little dangerous .
you don 't care ?
- well ...
you know it ?
- yeah .
- yac@@ aco@@ co ?
- no .
- lac@@ ol@@ ch@@ oko ?
am@@ as@@ hak ?
- no , i don 't know anything about it .
- do you have a map ?
- yes .
show me .
maybe i can help ...
jesus christ .
what kind of map is that ?
- it 's from 1772 !
- you have a rum deal , man !
mexico city 's got a bit bigger since then !
0@@ k .
it seems crazy , but this map , drawn in 1772 ,
mexico city is still inside what was the old island .
you can still see the network of can@@ als and the main roads of the az@@ tec city are still there .
to the end , the mexic@@ ans vie@@ wed the span@@ i@@ ards as con@@ temp@@ tible people who killed brave warriors at a distance with guns ,
in the az@@ tec calend@@ ar , the final day was 3-@@ serp@@ ent , the beginning of the time of lam@@ entation and remem@@ br@@ ance ,
the day human be@@ ings were reminded of their place in the re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess cycle of time ,
this is where the war ended , the exact spot .
this little church was built on the place where cu@@ au@@ h@@ tem@@ oc sur@@ ren@@ dered .
i find the az@@ tec version of this story as powerful and moving as homer 's " ili@@ ad , " the tale of troy .
the az@@ tec@@ s accept their fate without a trace of self-@@ p@@ ity .
it 's as if , in their vision of time and destiny , the cycle of history , the bun@@ dle of years , had just been lo@@ aded against them .
the az@@ tec lam@@ ent@@ ations have been handed down to us ,
" broken spears line the streets ,
" we have tor@@ n our hair in gri@@ ef
" 0@@ ur houses are ro@@ of@@ less now , " our walls red with blood
" 0@@ ur in@@ herit@@ ance , our city , is lost ,
" the shi@@ el@@ ds of our warriors were its def@@ ence " but they could not save it ,
" 0@@ ur heritage is gone , "
a year or two after the conqu@@ est , while a new mexico was rising on the ru@@ ins of the old ,
cortes fo@@ unded a hospital for the good of his soul on the spot where monte@@ z@@ uma had wel@@ com@@ ed him ,
by then , the king of sp@@ ain had sho@@ wered him with hon@@ ours ,
the poor boy from me@@ del@@ lin had become the most famous man in christ@@ en@@ dom ,
his tal@@ ents served him well .
the gamb@@ ler who gamb@@ led everything and won .
but maybe in the end it was a hol@@ low victory .
for in ach@@ ie@@ ving his dream , he had to ru@@ in it .
it 's given to few people in history sing@@ le-@@ han@@ de@@ dly to destroy a civil@@ isation .

in the early 16@@ th century two boys grew up here , dre@@ aming of gold and conqu@@ est ,
but when they left sp@@ ain for the new world , they became dead@@ ly enem@@ ies in one of the epic dram@@ as of history the search for el dor@@ ado ,
( train 's kla@@ x@@ 0@@ n bl@@ 0@@ ws )
this is the old route from the pacific up to quito in ecuador , in the 15@@ 30@@ s and ' 40@@ s , it was trav@@ el@@ led by advent@@ ur@@ ers and conquist@@ ad@@ ors , all hoping for riches beyond their dreams ,
even at the time , there were those among the span@@ ish con@@ quer@@ ors who realis@@ ed the immen@@ se histor@@ ical signific@@ ance of the fall of the new world .
" these are the greatest events , " wrote one of them , " since the beginning of the world . "
and the most cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic of them took place in just a few years , 15@@ 20@@ s , the fall of the az@@ tec@@ s , and then the fall of peru in the 15@@ 30@@ s .
and then the story shif@@ ts here to ecuador , as thous@@ ands of europe@@ ans flo@@ od into the continent , seek@@ ing new lands of gold .
among them was a span@@ ish captain called francisco 0@@ rel@@ lana ,
a vet@@ eran of the in@@ ca wars , 0@@ rel@@ lana was to be the hero of one of the most amazing jour@@ ne@@ ys of explor@@ ation ,
early in 1541 , he came here to quito ,
the old northern capital of the inc@@ as , quito was now a span@@ ish fron@@ tier town , 0@@ rel@@ lana had come to find his cousin , the new gover@@ nor gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
handsome and cruel , gonz@@ alo was in his early 30@@ s now , the greatest warrior in the new world
but gonz@@ alo was a man whose gre@@ ed had not been satisfied even by the gold of the inc@@ as ,
0@@ n@@ ly four years after the fall of p er@@ u , piz@@ ar@@ ro was dre@@ aming of he@@ w con@@ quest@@ s ,
from the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps of his palace in quito , he could see the andes rising to the east ,
early in 1541 , a rum@@ our began to swe@@ ep the city that beyond the mountains there lay a land rich@@ er than mexico or even peru ,
a land of gold
the r@@ uler of this land was said to be so rich that he covered himself in gold dust every , day and washed it off each evening ,
he was the golden man of el dor@@ ado ,
" i was fascin@@ ated , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" and i determined to disco@@ ver that land and to conqu@@ er it , "
and we set out to follow him ,
we took an expedition doctor with us , john col@@ ley ,
above 10,000 feet , you get altitude s@@ ick@@ ness potenti@@ ally , so where are we at now ?
yeah , we 're coming up to 12,000 feet here .
all through these camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s , they had to oper@@ ate at high altitude .
they develop@@ ed this kind of cot@@ ton , thick , quil@@ ted cot@@ ton arm@@ our to fight in the trop@@ ics .
but , of course , you 're dead on the equ@@ ator here , but you come to this altitude and you 're in serious trouble .
beyond the pe@@ aks , they entered a dren@@ ched green world , with stre@@ ams and water@@ falls , which eventually become the amazon ,
they might as well have been wander@@ ers on the surface of an alien planet ,
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's route has never been trac@@ ed on the ground
we know that for the first few months , he explo@@ red in a v@@ ast circle east@@ wards , but when his cousin 0@@ rel@@ lana joined him , they set off from their camp near ba@@ eza north@@ wards to the river co@@ ca ,
( man whist@@ les )
( man calls 0@@ ut ) - 0@@ k ?
- yeah .
0@@ h , jesus christ .
( gr@@ 0@@ ans )
how many people did piz@@ ar@@ ro bring down here ?
it 's quite sli@@ p@@ per@@ y here .
be careful .
( whist@@ ling )
are the horses with us ?
- ( man calls 0@@ ut )
- yeah , good .
- how many people did he have with him ?
- 220 conquist@@ ad@@ ors .
4,000 nat@@ ive bear@@ ers .
200 horses , hund@@ reds of hun@@ ting dogs .
hund@@ reds of llam@@ as to carry gear .
incredi@@ ble .
to piz@@ ar@@ ro 's alarm , his v@@ ast army of nat@@ ive bear@@ ers was rapid@@ ly wast@@ ing away ,
the span@@ ish had 4,000 nat@@ ive bear@@ ers with them from the high@@ lands , but they all died by the time they reached the pl@@ ains .
the history books say they were high@@ land people who came down here and couldn 't cope , but why should 4,000 have died , do you think ?
was it malaria ?
not malaria .
that was something the span@@ ish brought over with them .
0@@ f course , there were all these other infec@@ ti@@ ous dis@@ eas@@ es like me@@ as@@ les and smal@@ l@@ po@@ x and so forth .
but these big waves of epide@@ mic@@ s would have been through already , before this expedition set off , so i wonder if there was something else .
we should ask del@@ ph@@ ine .
he 's the exper@@ t .
star@@ v@@ ation , i think .
del@@ ph@@ ine .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish ) 0@@ ur guide del@@ ph@@ ine was a man who knows how to survive in the forest ,
( b@@ 0@@ th speak span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) i don 't think it 's possible to find that much food for that many people , because you can 't always rely on the jungle to provi@@ de you with food or fruit .
i think it would be impossible to feed them .
star@@ v@@ ation .
you can imagine trying to find food in this area for that huge number of people .
so the 4,000 indi@@ ans bas@@ ically were star@@ ved to death .
i pres@@ ume they 'd be the bottom of the fe@@ eding chain as well .
and bas@@ ically left to f@@ end for themselves as things got really tou@@ gh .
" the terrain was terrible , " said p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" we had to h@@ ack our own path through ,
" and we were worn out already from the cros@@ sing of the andes , "
frustr@@ ated and angry piz@@ ar@@ ro took it out on his nat@@ ive gu@@ ides , tor@@ turing them , burning them alive and fe@@ eding them to his dogs , not a man to argue with ,
food was a growing problem , even for the span@@ i@@ ards ,
" in the end , " says piz@@ ar@@ ro , " we were forced to eat the bu@@ ds of a plant like a v@@ ine stal@@ k , "
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
0@@ n@@ ly the little cur@@ ly bu@@ d on the top .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
that was before they started eating their preci@@ ous horses ,
at last we reached the first land@@ mark descri@@ bed by the span@@ ish ,
hidden behind the falls , legend says , was the gold of the in@@ ca at@@ ahu@@ al@@ pa ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) those who are in touch with nature believe that the spir@@ its exist@@ s here .
( span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) yes , this is a door to the spiritu@@ al world .
the real story of what 's behind the falls , not that it 's gold as the span@@ ish believed , but behind there is the entry to the world of the spir@@ its .
isn 't it wonderful ?
everything the span@@ ish understand liter@@ ally that the indi@@ ans actually mean metap@@ hor@@ ically .
" and so we pushed on through thick forest , " piz@@ ar@@ ro says ,
" h@@ acking with ax@@ es and mach@@ etes , "
" 0@@ ften it was impossible to get our horses through , "
see what an effort it is just to h@@ ack a path through virgin forest .
you 're lucky if you do a mile or two each day .
can you imagine what this was like for hund@@ reds of people and all their bag@@ gage and their animals trying to get their way through this ?
it just doesn 't bear thinking about .
at last , after six months in the jungle , they emer@@ ged from the andes fo@@ oth@@ il@@ ls and saw this view , an immen@@ se flat horizon ,
even with their limited knowledge , they must have known this stretched all the way to the atlantic , but how far was that and what lay in between ?
( michael ) the big stones .
there 's a branch under there .
they mar@@ ched on down the co@@ ca ,
" there were many days , " says piz@@ ar@@ ro ,
" when we were wad@@ ing kne@@ e-@@ deep , wa@@ ist@@ -@@ deep or even worse , "
it 's deep .
and still no sign of el dor@@ ado ,
by now , seven months in , the army was de@@ mor@@ alis@@ ed many were too sick to move ,
though he hid it from his men , piz@@ ar@@ ro was desperate ,
0@@ rel@@ lana now tried to persu@@ ade him to turn back , but piz@@ ar@@ ro wouldn ' t give up his quest ,
he ordered his men to build a boat to carry , the sick and wo@@ unded and the heavy gear ,
it took his star@@ ving tro@@ ops a month to make , smel@@ ting their hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es to for@@ ge the nails ,
but there was an easier way , using ren@@ ew@@ able bal@@ sa wood , we made a tradition@@ al raf@@ t with hard@@ wood nails and ro@@ pes oo bar@@ k ,
with this , we hoped to follow piz@@ ar@@ ro down the co@@ ca to the river n@@ apo ,
it just goes to show .
the span@@ ish went to all that trouble about getting nails and you only need some hard wood and some soft wood and you can do it without metal .
we 'll see if it works .
( sh@@ 0@@ ut@@ ing )
it 's our brig@@ ant@@ ine .
i don 't think we 'll do the full 3,000 miles on that , though .
i don 't mind .
piz@@ ar@@ ro 's army set off again on the 9@@ th of november , 1541 , 0@@ f the beauti@@ es of the lands@@ cape around them , there 's no mention in his account ,
this is what you never read in the history books .
you never feel the sense of this immen@@ se forest , stret@@ ching for 2,000 or more miles .
this immen@@ se blue sky and this great river .
even with the boat , progress was pain@@ fully slow ,
they could still only go as fast as the army , tr@@ ud@@ ging along the bank ,
( thunder )
they mar@@ ched on for 43 days , christmas came ,
by now some of the span@@ i@@ ards were dying of star@@ v@@ ation ,
their christmas was made even more miser@@ able by the news that a v@@ ast un@@ in@@ habit@@ ed region lay ahead , where no food was to be found
it was piz@@ ar@@ ro 's nightmare ,
mut@@ in@@ y was in the air , and then 0@@ rel@@ lana stepped forward
that christmas , in their camp here by the river , the whole expedition deeply de@@ pressed by the strugg@@ le of the last ten months ,
0@@ rel@@ lana came up to piz@@ ar@@ ro and said , " look , give me the brig@@ ant@@ ine , give me the boat ,
" and a few can@@ o@@ es , some of the men and i 'll go down@@ stream
" to try and find some food and i 'll come back in three or four days . "
piz@@ ar@@ ro looked at him and said , " whatever you think 's best . "
0@@ rel@@ lana left next day with 57 men ,
but within days , so he said later , he realis@@ ed the current was too strong and he couldn ' t go back ,
" so we chose what seemed to us the les@@ ser of two ev@@ ils , " 0@@ rel@@ lana said ,
" trust@@ ing to god we 'd go on and follow the river
" and either die or see what mar@@ vel@@ s lay ahead "
what he didn ' t know was that ahead of him was the greatest river on earth ,
the first few days they passed through an empty lands@@ cape , che@@ wing their boots to stay alive , so close to death , they were hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ating ,
then , on mon@@ day evening , the 8@@ th of janu@@ ary they heard dr@@ ums , 0@@ rel@@ lana landed and nervo@@ usly went into the forest ,
they were the first europe@@ ans to walk in the interior of a maz@@ onia , - do you think they might be asleep ?
- i don 't think there 's any@@ body home right now .
they 've got their boots right here .
but they 're obviously ...
it 's closed up .
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
there 's nobody here .
well , they did run away when 0@@ rel@@ lana first landed .
left their cook@@ ing pots and their food .
0@@ rel@@ lana 's men were star@@ ving , so , of course , they stu@@ ffed themselves .
the indi@@ ans were very nice about it when they came back .
the man 's name was tap@@ ui , nelson tap@@ ui ,
he far@@ med here with his family , pretty much cut off from the outside world
( speak span@@ ish )
he spoke que@@ chua , the in@@ ca language ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
0@@ h , he 'll have to talk slo@@ wer than that .
and language would be the key to 0@@ rel@@ lana 's surviv@@ al ,
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
he began to put words down in a no@@ te@@ book ,
what 's the name in que@@ chuan ?
- l@@ omo .
- l@@ omo .
so yo@@ ca is l@@ omo .
that 's very ...
" the captain made a point to get to understand the nat@@ ive langu@@ ages , " says the di@@ ary ,
and he made his own primer to help him , so if you ask for good water to drink , to drink .
( spe@@ aks que@@ chuan )
nelson sent his son up a tree to bring se@@ ed po@@ ds for us to eat ,
the nat@@ ive people here were called imara , they gave 0@@ rel@@ lana food , too ,
they let the span@@ i@@ ards stay with them for a month to reco@@ ver their health ,
saved them from death ,
( they speak que@@ chuan )
can i open ?
0@@ k .
i could get into these .
del@@ icious .
- m@@ mm .
- m@@ mm .
at this moment , 0@@ rel@@ lana was still thinking like a conquist@@ ador , he told his host@@ s that he was claim@@ ing them and their land for the king of sp@@ ain ,
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
but maybe a change was beginning to take place in his mind , for kind treat@@ ment of the indi@@ ans , he said now , was the right way to follow ,
0@@ ver the coming months , 0@@ rel@@ lana would make contact with many different indian pe@@ op@@ les ,
some , like nelson , would feed and shel@@ ter him ,
some would try , to kill him ,
the mum gives us a smile .
she thought we were ali@@ ens at first .
back up@@ river , piz@@ ar@@ ro was waiting for 0@@ rel@@ lana to return , his men now dying around him ,
and as the days turned to weeks , he began to susp@@ ect that his lo@@ yal cousin might have betr@@ ayed him ,
0@@ rel@@ lana 's en@@ counter with the imara had offered hope of surviv@@ al ,
now he and his men decided to get their story , straight ,
they ap@@ pointed a scri@@ be to put down on paper why they 'd deser@@ ted p iz@@ ar@@ ro ,
and each and every , one of them put his name to it ,
" we 've trav@@ el@@ led 200 le@@ ag@@ ues through sav@@ age jungle , " they said .
" we 've all seen it with our own eyes .
" we 've felt constant fear of losing our lives because of suff@@ ering and hunger .
" how much more danger and death would there be were we to turn back now ?
" there@@ fore we all beg you , " they say to 0@@ rel@@ lana , " not to ask us to do this .
" and we ask our scri@@ be to write it down .
" and we are all willing to follow you by any other route to save our lives .
" but not to turn back . "
but was 0@@ rel@@ lana being quite tru@@ th@@ ful ?
0@@ r did he hope to claim the secret of el dor@@ ado for himself
we continued on his track , down the co@@ ca to its jun@@ ction with the n@@ apo ,
not so long ago , this was just a mission station , now the town of francisco 0@@ rel@@ lana is a wild west place which has bo@@ omed with the opening up of the forest to the new conquist@@ ad@@ ors , the log@@ gers and the oil men ,
just looking round our@@ selves and seeing the open se@@ wers and dogs running wild and the terrible over@@ crow@@ ding and you suddenly understand why it was that dis@@ eas@@ es evol@@ ved in cities , where there are huge concentr@@ ations of people , rather than in the far heal@@ th@@ ier li@@ fest@@ yle of the jungle .
and this is , i suppose , the second conquist@@ o , isn 't it , you know .
first they came looking for gold and el dor@@ ado and now the forest@@ s are being pl@@ under@@ ed .
they 've had their rub@@ ber and now it 's the hard@@ woods and it 's black gold - oil .
- adi@@ os , amigo . - yeah , b@@ ye-@@ bye .
when you get to man@@ aus , remember , if you go sw@@ im@@ ming , don 't have a pee .
and so we said our good@@ b@@ yes to dr col@@ ley , 0@@ h , dear .
0@@ ur next leg would take us down the n@@ apo , the conquist@@ ad@@ ors ' river of cin@@ nam@@ on ,
here 's to the river n@@ apo .
0@@ rel@@ lana sa@@ iled on past other great ri@@ vers , the agu@@ ar@@ ico , the cur@@ aray , down into what is now peru ,
" we made good speed , " says the di@@ ary ,
" sometimes more than 20 le@@ ag@@ ues a day , for the river 's flow was swift and strong , "
0@@ rel@@ lana was now on one of the main trib@@ utar@@ ies of the amazon , heading east through a v@@ ast flu@@ id wil@@ dern@@ ess ,
from the air , it 's a be@@ wil@@ dering ma@@ ze ,
0@@ ut here nature seems to have no bo@@ unds ,
0@@ rel@@ lana and his men must have gazed on the scene , part in wonder , part in terror ,
a few days later , they came to a gig@@ antic conflu@@ ence , the n@@ apo and the mar@@ an@@ on , the beginning of the amazon proper ,
and as 0@@ rel@@ lana reached the mar@@ an@@ on , far to the west , piz@@ ar@@ ro had finally given up hope of seeing him again and ordered his men to turn back ,
there 's a shift now in the tone of the expedition di@@ ary , kept by the priest , father car@@ vaj@@ al ,
it may be hin@@ d@@ sight , but he seems aware now that the journey was turning into an epic of explor@@ ation ,
" it seemed to us , by our continu@@ ing surviv@@ al ,
" that our lord jesus was pleased with such a great vent@@ ure into the un@@ known ,
" for such a fe@@ at of discovery , surely might not otherwise have taken place
" for many centur@@ ies into the future , "
ah .

it was here that 0@@ rel@@ lana first heard strange stories of a fier@@ ce tri@@ be of female warriors , like the amaz@@ ons of gre@@ ek my@@ th ,
( rhyth@@ mic f@@ 0@@ l@@ k s@@ 0@@ ng )
his contempor@@ aries never believed him , but he always s@@ wore the tale was true ,
it 's a my@@ th which cro@@ ps up in many places and maybe it 's not just a my@@ th ,
the span@@ ish say that when they came down the amazon , there were all these trib@@ es that were rul@@ ed by women and only when they wanted children did they go and raid and get the men and have sex with them and get pregnant
and then they 'd boot the men out .
are there still ...
can you still find women like this on the amazon ?
( w@@ 0@@ man trans@@ lat@@ es )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) ah , domin@@ ant .
yes , there are woman who are domin@@ ant .
0@@ f course .
yes , there are women who have power over the men .
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings nat@@ ive fol@@ k@@ ball@@ ad )
no one knows for sure whether the amaz@@ ons really exist@@ ed
but they gave the river the name it still has today , rio amaz@@ onas , the river of the amaz@@ ons ,
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings fol@@ k@@ ball@@ ad )
all the way through what is now peru , the local people treated these strang@@ ers from another world kin@@ dly ,
but did 0@@ rel@@ lana ever see them as fully human like himself
i think he remained a conquist@@ ador ,
non@@ eth@@ eless , he was still carefully recor@@ ding words from the river langu@@ ages ,
( w@@ 0@@ man spe@@ aks l@@ 0@@ cal dial@@ ect )
" next to god , " says the di@@ ary " the captain 's understanding of the nat@@ ive langu@@ ages
" was the deci@@ ding factor in sav@@ ing us all from death , "
( they speak l@@ 0@@ cal dial@@ ect )
0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , is the first description of the pe@@ op@@ les of a maz@@ onia ,
" this part of the river , " he says , " they were part of a great federation , the ap@@ ari@@ ans , "
in the two centur@@ ies after the coming of the span@@ ish , 90 % of the population here died from violence and disease ,
today the survi@@ vor@@ s are people living after a holo@@ ca@@ ust ,
it was a trag@@ edy which went almost un@@ recor@@ ded
here in i@@ quit@@ os , father joaquin is trying to set the record straight , to reco@@ ver the lost history , of a maz@@ onia ,
( they speak span@@ ish )
in the 16@@ th century these were big town@@ s , large and well-@@ organis@@ ed commun@@ ities ,
so maybe what you see now is a distant remin@@ der of what 0@@ rel@@ lana saw ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
( trans@@ lat@@ 0@@ r ) i had studied the case of 0@@ rel@@ lana for a long time and i conclu@@ ded that 0@@ rel@@ lana met a huge diver@@ sity of pe@@ op@@ les here .
we wondered what happened to all these people .
we rec@@ kon there were over six million in the whole of amaz@@ onia .
( michael ) the span@@ i@@ ards were amaz@@ ed by the natural produce of the forest and the river , the huge quant@@ ities of fish of every , kind , parro@@ ts , tur@@ t@@ les as large as leather shi@@ el@@ ds ,

in his library father joaquin has a copy of the original di@@ ary ,

this is amazon time .
0@@ rel@@ lana stayed with the ap@@ ari@@ ans for two months to build a second , bigger boat , a 30-@@ fo@@ o@@ ter ,
a boat strong enough for the sea ,
when he left in late april , he still had 2,000 miles of river to go ,
( w@@ 0@@ man s@@ ings )
the dream of el dor@@ ado is distant now , and for me the voyage had begun to ga@@ ther like stat@@ ic the history , of the interven@@ ing 500 years , the later conquist@@ ad@@ ors , like the de@@ ment@@ ed agu@@ ir@@ re , the so-@@ called w@@ rath of god
the mission@@ aries , the pro@@ spec@@ tors and the de@@ bt ra@@ id@@ ers , they all came this way ,
and the clam@@ our of history , rose like the sound of the forest in the night ,
and in the ghost@@ ly sha@@ pes we passed , it was easy to imagine the span@@ i@@ ards on their frag@@ ile craft ,
" what hard@@ ships , what suff@@ ering and what extraordin@@ ary , dang@@ ers we passed through , "
wrote fri@@ ar car@@ vaj@@ al , he lost an eye in one attack ,
" the people are more host@@ ile now , "
and as for 0@@ rel@@ lana , too kin@@ d-@@ hear@@ ted a soul by far , some said he had learned to read the signs and to nego@@ ti@@ ate fear , most of all , perhaps , in himself
they now began to see can@@ o@@ es everywhere , they were appro@@ aching even rich@@ er lands ,
by the middle point of the river , they came past huge sett@@ lem@@ ents , exten@@ ding for many miles , without any g@@ aps between the clu@@ sters of houses .
these were large , well-@@ organis@@ ed commun@@ ities , with thous@@ ands of people , real high cultures .
they were now inside the territory , of a huge nat@@ ive federation , which stretched for hund@@ reds of miles along the river , the 0@@ mag@@ ua , they passed so many town@@ s that they could only remember them by giving jo@@ key tag@@ s to people and places ,
main street , chin@@ ato@@ wn , vic@@ io@@ us@@ ville and stup@@ id@@ ville ,
so 0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , off@@ ers a new history , for amaz@@ onia , an elabor@@ ate series of ancient king@@ dom@@ s , net@@ works and alli@@ ances , which had develop@@ ed over thous@@ ands of years , united by the river itself
after three days ' sa@@ iling , we reached the braz@@ ili@@ an fron@@ tier ,
0@@ rel@@ lana had to pass a bor@@ der here , too - the fron@@ tier of the mach@@ i@@ par@@ o state ,
he had to fight his way through ,
it 's so relaxed today i couldn ' t find anyone to stam@@ p my pas@@ sport ,
im@@ migration ?
im@@ migration ?
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
thanks .
gracias .
but the spec@@ tre of gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro still haun@@ ted 0@@ rel@@ lana and his men ,
0@@ rel@@ lana never forgot the potential cost of cros@@ sing gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro , a member of the most powerful family in the americ@@ as .
deser@@ tion , after all , was pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death .
and their boy@@ hood friend@@ ship would count for very little .
so he and his men , all through the journey , covered themselves .
this is the second main document they drew up , formal@@ ly pet@@ ition@@ ing 0@@ rel@@ lana to be their leader , and every single member of the expedition has signed it , with loud protest@@ ations of lo@@ yal@@ ty to the gover@@ nor , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro .
but , at this moment , they had no idea whether piz@@ ar@@ ro was alive or dead .
piz@@ ar@@ ro , though , was a man who could face death without flin@@ ching ,
the tale of his hell@@ ish return has insp@@ i@@ red movies , pl@@ ays and books ever since ,
" for suff@@ ering , fam@@ ine and mis@@ ery " wrote one conquist@@ ador ,
" this was the worst journey ever in the indi@@ es , "
att@@ acked all the way , piz@@ ar@@ ro didn ' t know where he was or what direction to take to reach peru , or any place christ@@ ians might be ,
" we ate all our dogs and horses , " he wrote ,
" and we got back with only our s@@ words and the rotten rag@@ s we stood up in , "
pl@@ zar@@ ro 's only thought now was reven@@ ge against his boy@@ hood chum , the worst li@@ ar that ever there was ,
and 0@@ rel@@ lana sa@@ iled on , as amazing spectac@@ les of nature came one after the other ,
in early june , 0@@ rel@@ lana arrived at the site of man@@ aus , where the river stret@@ ches to the horizon , as wide as an in@@ land sea ,
man@@ aus was built in the centre of the rain@@ forest , fo@@ unded as a jesu@@ it mission in the 18@@ th century when the opening up of a maz@@ onia really started
where the opera house and the grand man@@ sions now stand , 0@@ rel@@ lana saw huge sett@@ lem@@ ents of hat@@ ive people lin@@ ing the water@@ front ,
there are few places where you feel more strong@@ ly the all-@@ consum@@ ing march of history ,
looking centur@@ ies into the future , 0@@ rel@@ lana 's di@@ ary , says this -
" it was our desire that , if possible , the land and its barbar@@ ic people
" should not have negative feelings about our first en@@ counter ,
" so that one day the country , might be tam@@ ed for pac@@ ification
" and reduc@@ ed to obe@@ di@@ ence to our christian civil@@ isation , "
the western conception of a city was a new innov@@ ation in the americ@@ as which came with the conqu@@ est .
they requ@@ ire a new way of life , new la@@ ws and custom@@ s and institutions to make a new ident@@ ity , to res@@ ha@@ pe human@@ ity , if you like .
they also su@@ ck in the produc@@ ts of the natural world , of the forest and the river , and consum@@ e them .
and in that , cities like this , man@@ aus , re@@ present a break in that continu@@ um of thous@@ ands of years of life here in the americ@@ as .
there may have been five million indigen@@ ous people here , when 0@@ rel@@ lana came through .
the present population of the nat@@ ives of amaz@@ onia is 25@@ 0,000 , less than a quar@@ ter of this city .
that 's the scale of the revolution .
at last , after eight months on the river and against all the od@@ ds , in august , 15@@ 42 , 0@@ rel@@ lana reached the mouth of the amazon ,
they had sa@@ iled 2,@@ 500 miles down the greatest river on earth , they had seen un@@ known em@@ pi@@ res and en@@ counter@@ ed lost worl@@ ds ,
" it had been less of a journey , " said one of them , " more of a miracle , "
but even as their mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft bo@@ ats carried the 47 survi@@ vor@@ s to safety in the car@@ ib@@ bean , back in quito , gonz@@ alo piz@@ ar@@ ro was pet@@ ition@@ ing the king for reven@@ ge ,
( spe@@ aks span@@ ish )
piz@@ ar@@ ro acc@@ used 0@@ rel@@ lana of tre@@ ason , a crime pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death ,
" captain 0@@ rel@@ lana paid no heed to the duty that he o@@ wed your majest@@ y ,
" and to the well@@ being of the army and the whole expedition .
" instead of bringing us back food , he dis@@ played to us all the greatest cru@@ el@@ ty
" that ever fa@@ ith@@ less men have sho@@ wn .
" and he 's the worst trait@@ or that ever lived . "
in his def@@ ence , 0@@ rel@@ lana used the documents that they 'd drawn up on the river .
" piz@@ ar@@ ro wasn 't telling the truth .
what happened was his respon@@ sibil@@ ity .
" the fact was we couldn 't get back to him .
" and , in the end , it was god 's will that we went on to make such amazing disco@@ ver@@ ies . "
piz@@ ar@@ ro never came home ,
he died fighting the crown for his family 's empire in peru ,
his house is still there , the garden where he and gonz@@ alo crossed to@@ y s@@ words as boys ,
he married a weal@@ thy young wife , anna , but he couldn ' t sett@@ le back in sp@@ ain ,
he pet@@ ition@@ ed the king to send him back to his river , with the title of gover@@ nor of the amazon ,
but his luck ran out , the expedition was a dis@@ aster ,
this is how anna remembered 0@@ rel@@ lana 's death .
" my husband couldn 't find the main channel of the river
" and , for 11 months , we wander@@ ed around like lost people .
" and in that time , we suff@@ ered such hard@@ ships ,
" because of hunger , disease and inc@@ es@@ sant rain@@ fall .
" we ate all the horses and the dogs
" and , in the end , almost all the expedition died .
" my husband among them . "
hello , i would like you to touch wood
do you know this expression ?
the e@@ asi@@ est way to understand it is refer@@ ring to the he@@ at@@ wave of 2003 we have well known , may be more in the coun@@ try@@ side with agricul@@ tural production .
in 2003 this is my place that 's what grew and i did not har@@ vest@@ ed .
when we see this as a far@@ mer one has the right to wonder about the future .
that 's why i brought you wood that i will distribu@@ te .
touching wood , i think it 's good
it makes you feel calm .
it 's nice and it sm@@ ells good .
here 's a piece for each of you , if you want to distribu@@ te .
it 's cherry and plu@@ m .
there are probably few in paris .
pass it to the others and we will do a simple exper@@ iment
to show that these branches are the future of agriculture .
it seems crazy !
we hear of agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the br@@ ink and we are on the br@@ ink .
i 'll show you the same experience as i had .
you take the branch and you do like that .
it can be sha@@ ped like a circle very easily .
and what i experienced in 2003 , in 2004 i did not experienced .
because the fle@@ xi@@ bil@@ ity of these small branches that are produc@@ ed every year growing every day the forest makes them .
the best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans .
agriculture has deriv@@ ed to the assist@@ ant@@ ship , to technology .
far@@ mers who don 't understand ground anymore .
far@@ mers have forgotten that the best model and prag@@ mat@@ ism of life encour@@ age us to watch the living .
from the living , the forest is the best ex@@ ample .
no human intervention no wat@@ ering , no fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ ers , pest@@ ici@@ des , fung@@ ici@@ des it works alone .
when i discovered the fle@@ xi@@ bil@@ ity of the small branch i wondered :
why the branches of large diam@@ eter break easily ?
wh@@ ere@@ as we can shape small branches as a circle that re@@ present the virtu@@ ous circle of trees which produ@@ ces branches in huge quant@@ ities .
i found on the internet an explan@@ ation of the forest and its so@@ il .
we learn that leaves are att@@ ached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall .
they re@@ store 50 to 60 % of their content to the branches .
in this branch you are holding ,
there all the nu@@ tri@@ ents which allow bu@@ ds in a few months to make new branches which con@@ tain branches for the following year .
trees re@@ start their grow@@ th only with the content of the small branches .
on large diam@@ eter branches there are no such nu@@ tri@@ ents .
as you read this , you think you can already act individu@@ ally and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches .
the more we are numer@@ ous and the more is the occasion to meet , to live well then we cut the branches , we ga@@ ther them we make pile and grin@@ d it in a machine .
this is a techn@@ ical operation , but not insur@@ moun@@ table .
in africa , we do it with a mach@@ ete .
we spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm , no more .
we realize that this is not pro@@ hibit@@ ive for a garden with this material which is hidden here .
i will open it later .
when it is placed on the ground in winter , spring we incorpor@@ ate it .
you mean there is something about se@@ as@@ ons ?
yes , indeed .
at the arri@@ val of winter , the branches store nu@@ tri@@ ents .
it 's going nowhere but in the branches , only at that time .
in the spring , those elements are diff@@ used again .
so we proce@@ ed to what is called incorpor@@ ation .
after a few weeks the agricul@@ tural so@@ il that was here main@@ ly stones has become this .
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer .
here is the top and there underneath .
we see my@@ cel@@ ium , the real mus@@ h@@ room .
the my@@ cel@@ ium is our collabor@@ ator to do what nature does only with mus@@ h@@ rooms food chain with the lig@@ nin molec@@ ule .
the lig@@ nin molec@@ ule is very ener@@ ge@@ tic and here comes a complex food chain of the so@@ il .
the cultiv@@ ated agricul@@ tural land be@@ comes a forest so@@ il .
it is a copy / pa@@ ste of forest so@@ il / agricul@@ tural land .
it works surpris@@ ingly for this st@@ ony so@@ il with the r@@ cw to grow whe@@ at
with y@@ iel@@ ds almost higher than normal .
the surprise is enor@@ mous , because the trees grow too as well as veg@@ etab@@ les .
there you are on lim@@ est@@ one plate@@ aus of quer@@ cy i invite you to my place .
i brought you brac@@ n@@ ches from my place , but here it is .
z@@ uc@@ chini grow in full sun .
no wat@@ ering , just se@@ ed@@ lings .
i plant the se@@ eds in the ground and wait for it to grow .
this year , with 12 z@@ uc@@ chin@@ is , i picked up 190 kil@@ os .
no wat@@ ering , no phy@@ to@@ sanit@@ ary treat@@ ment , no we@@ ed control .
it might looks like the garden of eden we put the se@@ eds in the ground and har@@ v@@ est .
these are my productions .
un@@ fe@@ as@@ ible on the plateau .
when you say you are going to grow car@@ ro@@ ts on lim@@ est@@ one plate@@ aus everyone says it , ag@@ ron@@ om@@ ists , exper@@ ts there are 30 to 40 % of stones ,
30 cm of so@@ il , impossible .
no water , no fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ er , no treat@@ ment .
y@@ iel@@ ds are 160 to 170 % .
the amount of dry matter is 30 % extra .
which means that the pl@@ ants have less water and are ta@@ st@@ ier they over@@ cook less easily and preserv@@ ation is much longer .
no evidence of disease , pl@@ ague , ap@@ hi@@ ds or pest@@ s
it seems mag@@ ical .
no human intervention .
it is like facing the forest without human intervention .
is it still agriculture ?
is this a new concept ?
even in mali , burkina faso , togo , gest@@ ures are the same , the resul@@ ts are the same .
when small branches are grin@@ ded , we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenom@@ en@@ on .
mus@@ h@@ rooms of a certain family will take nu@@ tri@@ ents trig@@ gers a food chain which indu@@ ces life returning in so@@ il .
i have not mentioned the name , but it is r@@ cw
w for wood
r for ram@@ ial , branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree be@@ aring leaves , where photo@@ synth@@ esis happens .
energy from the sun , trans@@ formed by the leaves is sto@@ red in the branches
this concept bo@@ thers ag@@ ron@@ om@@ y , the far@@ ming profes@@ sion must be re@@ invent@@ ed .
you imagine a farm with 20 to 30 % of forest area or wood .
it can occu@@ r without so@@ il condit@@ ion@@ er with 50 % less water at least and a y@@ ield of 160 to 170 % .
you do it every 4-5 years .
it is about sust@@ ain@@ ability
this concept affec@@ ts many people but research has diffic@@ ulti@@ es to take it in account .
this pack@@ age , for those who want , we can share it because it works in the garden , in a flower pot , with a lem@@ on tree or a plant that you like .
you put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
you will have the most beautiful fruits less wat@@ ering needs and besides it 's beautiful , it sm@@ ells good .
for those that want to smell and take some there is a charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic smell of forest .
i invite you to share this meal with the ground .
note :
c of r@@ cw stands for chip@@ ped
sub@@ title and trans@@ lation :
this is a rock@@ et sto@@ ve .
rock@@ et sto@@ ves gener@@ ally cre@@ ate much more eff@@ ici@@ ent combust@@ ion and are better able to store heat than conven@@ tionn@@ al sto@@ ves .
and so , i decided i wanted to build this sto@@ ve rather than use the previ@@ ous one that i had because i wanted to be putting less pollu@@ tion into the atmosphere but also this sto@@ ve , you actually feed wood into the top
which means that you can put long pieces of wood , directly into the sto@@ ve and it doesn 't have to be cut to be able to burn .
so , i can put the wood in here and the burning actually happens down in the bottom of this area and then , the flu@@ e gas will travel through the sto@@ ve there is a ris@@ er up inside the bar@@ rel itself
that cre@@ ates a draft so that you can actually have the wood fe@@ eding in through the top and then the flu@@ e gas will travel up , hit the top of the bar@@ el on the inside and then there is an opening on the outside .
on the inside of the bar@@ rel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle .
all the flu@@ e gas will travel down around the outside of the bar@@ rel and out through the back and up , out of the chim@@ ney .
all this co@@ b here that surro@@ unds the sto@@ ve is desig@@ ned to capture the heat from the combust@@ ion so that it 's not just all going straight up the chim@@ ney .
with a conven@@ tionn@@ al sto@@ ve the heat ten@@ ds to travel out of the building very quickly .
this allo@@ ws for more of the heat to be sto@@ red in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the co@@ b .
so , this is the sky house rock@@ et sto@@ ve
it is a sort of a wall in between our din@@ ning room and our living room .
bas@@ ically , you got the in@@ take here the bar@@ rel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of co@@ b surro@@ unding most of the bar@@ rel here .
this entire wall is actually a co@@ b wall .
bas@@ ically we got a lot more mass to store heat in we 've got a little bit of area where the bar@@ rel is ex@@ posed so that is gon@@ na through heat in the room quickly when you first light the sto@@ ve but for the most part we are looking at the sto@@ ve
to store heat for a long time and we burn the fire here in the morning , we can run it for a few hours and all of this co@@ b will still be warm into the evening .
so , here we are on the other side of the wall , in the din@@ ing room .
here is the other side of the bar@@ rel en@@ cas@@ ed in co@@ b and then the flu@@ e of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve runs all the way through this bench and up that chim@@ ney .
one of the benef@@ it of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve is that you can have a long horizon@@ tal run of your flu@@ e p@@ ipe and you can monit@@ or a bench or under a bed or wh@@ er@@ ever you want to store that heat .
normally we have a table here so this one of the seat of the table , that is very popular when we are in winter cause this area gon@@ na stay warm pretty much all day until the evening if we fire the rock@@ et sto@@ ve that day .
there is about 4 to 6 inches of co@@ b on top of the flu@@ e here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it he@@ ats up .
i would say 2 or 3 hours but then it w@@ il stay warm thro@@ ugh@@ out the day .
the front of the rock@@ et sto@@ ve there is only about 2 inches between the flu@@ e and the front and that he@@ ats up a little faster sometimes it is almost a little too hot so that 4 inches is really great if it 's going
to be an area , where you are physic@@ ally in contact with .
like this bench .
we oil the bench to water@@ proof it cause it is near the table .
the chim@@ ney runs up as co@@ b all the way up into the second story and that , again sto@@ res ther@@ mal mass up into the bedro@@ oms , upstairs as well .
sub@@ tit@@ les :
welcome to bas@@ alt mountain lo@@ cated on the northern rim of the ro@@ aring fork valley in colorado .
the clim@@ ate here is hot and dry in the summer and fri@@ gi@@ d in the winter .
to the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here .
until now no one would have considered far@@ ming in this dry rocky nu@@ tri@@ ent poor so@@ il .
but thanks to our current understanding of nature 's natural proces@@ ses one man has built up a nu@@ tri@@ ent rich so@@ il upon this dry un@@ des@@ ir@@ able clay forming the foundation for a th@@ ri@@ ving eco@@ system
jerome o@@ sen@@ to@@ wski is the man behind the eco@@ system and the central rocky mountain per@@ macul@@ ture institute .
nest@@ led on the side of bas@@ alt mountain l@@ ye one acre of edi@@ ble forest garden guil@@ ds and four pas@@ sive and active solar green@@ houses which have become a large part of jerome 's most recent per@@ macul@@ ture ende@@ av@@ ors
i came to colorado in 1969 and i spent about the first seven or eight , ten years as a ski instruc@@ tor .
and gradu@@ ally got interested in heal@@ thy fo@@ ods
through having some@@ what of a health crisis with hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia so i decided to look into wild fo@@ ods and that lead me into growing my own gar@@ dens and using wild fo@@ ods when it was avail@@ able
jerome began gar@@ den@@ ing in the low@@ lands of the bas@@ alt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on bas@@ alt mountain due to the ar@@ id so@@ ils and difficul@@ ty in har@@ nes@@ sing water but once i learned about per@@ macul@@ ture
i found that it was totally possible to cre@@ ate these beautiful gar@@ dens using rec@@ yc@@ led materi@@ als , and building compo@@ st , sheet mul@@ ching , using per@@ en@@ ni@@ al and ann@@ ual veg@@ etab@@ les
in combin@@ ations of design@@ s
so , we started ann@@ ual gar@@ den@@ ing here for ten years or so and then we gradu@@ ally segu@@ ed into per@@ en@@ ni@@ al poly@@ cultures outside and now inside and we 've taught hund@@ reds of people here through intern@@ ship program@@ s and through the different design courses and work@@ sho@@ ps here .
what 's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combin@@ ation of pl@@ ants in our forest gar@@ dens and see how we build our green@@ house
but jerome 's succes@@ s in per@@ macul@@ ture hasn 't come without some major road blo@@ cks
in 2008 a devast@@ ating fire burned down one of his first tropical green@@ house 's iron@@ ically named p@@ ele [ after the hawa@@ i@@ ian fire god@@ dess ] to the ground .
the fire in p@@ ele was actually a bles@@ sing in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger , better green@@ house .
so i worked with michael thomson my partner in eco@@ systems design to re@@ design the new green@@ house .
at the time that p@@ ele burned down jerome had been working with well know local archit@@ ect michael thompson on advan@@ cing green@@ house design by introduc@@ ing what jerome called " clim@@ ate batter@@ y technology "
the destruction of p@@ ele gave the two the chance to put their lat@@ est research to the test and in the spirit on new begin@@ n@@ ings the new green@@ house would be named phoenix after the myth@@ ological bird that bur@@ ns itself and r@@ ises from the ash@@ es to live through another cycle .
hi i 'm michael thompson ,
i 'm chief archit@@ ect with eco@@ systems design in bas@@ alt colorado and partner with jerome o@@ sen@@ to@@ wski .
the clim@@ ate batter@@ y as we now call it , is a series of tu@@ bing in which air is taken in at the high point of the green@@ house , pum@@ ped through tu@@ bing , and exhaust@@ ed at the south end of the green@@ house .
and then that air circul@@ ates over and over again picking up heat and then deli@@ vering it underground and stor@@ ing it .
so at eco@@ systems design , we cre@@ ate design@@ s for green@@ houses and pas@@ sive solar buildings and hom@@ es as well as out@@ door lands@@ cap@@ ing per@@ en@@ ni@@ als and annu@@ als for organ@@ ic agriculture in the rocky mountain region .
in ad@@ dition to desig@@ ning in@@ door and out@@ door per@@ macul@@ ture and edi@@ ble lands@@ cap@@ es
we cre@@ ate the buildings that allow that in@@ door growing , such as this one in ste@@ am@@ boat springs .
this is a large thirty six by eigh@@ ty foot green@@ house that will support sub-@@ tropical and anything below that .
and here we have inside the green@@ house , all of these plant@@ ing be@@ ds that we have created above ground and under ground we have these forced air heat stor@@ age systems
so all of these fans are deli@@ vering air through these vertic@@ al ris@@ ers which then underground distribu@@ te the warm air through these horizon@@ tal manif@@ olds through these per@@ for@@ ated tu@@ bes that deli@@ ver the heat and the mo@@ ist@@ ure from that air into the so@@ il for use later in the cold nights .
so as a res@@ ult we get these in@@ door environ@@ ments that are very well insul@@ ated and he@@ ated against winter conditions such as this last year .
and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experien@@ cing is uh@@ h ...
this is when we began the plant@@ ing of this green@@ house last au@@ tum@@ n , and this spring we had this much grow@@ th in there .
so we have flowers , we have other pl@@ ants that support the insec@@ t populations for benefici@@ al control@@ s and for pol@@ lin@@ ation , and we have all of the so@@ il conditions and the clim@@ ate conditions to grow tropical ban@@ ana pl@@ ants , and gu@@ av@@ as and fig@@ s and pap@@ aya et@@ cet@@ era .
and these green@@ houses also function very well as early propag@@ ation cent@@ ers
where we can start the pl@@ ants in febru@@ ary that will grow out@@ doors as annu@@ als .
we also have clim@@ ate control equip@@ ment like these cur@@ tains that draw across underneath the g@@ laz@@ ing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insul@@ ating layer for accompl@@ ishing that .
so we also do solar hom@@ es solar energy produc@@ tive buildings .
in ad@@ dition to desig@@ ning green@@ houses for private invest@@ ors cr@@ mp@@ i and growing sp@@ aces are building growing dom@@ es for local scho@@ ols in colorado in order to raise a@@ waren@@ ess about the importance of a local food econom@@ y .
the institute has cur@@ r@@ ently built a growing dome at y@@ ampa mountain high school in glen@@ wood springs and the ro@@ aring fork high school in carbon@@ dale both facilit@@ ies will be utiliz@@ ed as class@@ rooms for sust@@ ain@@ able agriculture cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ ums and the food produc@@ ed will be integr@@ ated into the school lun@@ ches@@ . there you can find out more about our services and brow@@ se our design galler@@ ies .
for more information about the central rocky mountain per@@ macul@@ ture institute and how you can contribu@@ te please visit cr@@ mp@@ i.@@ org there you 'll find deta@@ iled information about our growing dome projec@@ ts via the community food initiative as well as work@@ shop dates and intern@@ ship avail@@ ability .
and built the geo@@ desi@@ c growing dom@@ es used at the local high scho@@ ols and special thanks to john cru@@ ick@@ sh@@ ank for his role in the techn@@ ological advan@@ c@@ ements of what is now called the clim@@ ate batter@@ y
thanks for watching
water
water is
water is life .
bassin de reten@@ tion d '@@ eau a tam@@ era ( portugal )
avec sep@@ p hol@@ zer et ben@@ rd muller
water is life .
water is the most important thing .
the whole world is 70 % water .
we , animals , every@@ th@@ ing-@@ 70 % water .
water is the key issue for the surviv@@ al human kind on this planet .
nature has provi@@ ded enough water everywhere on earth ;
but , a bil@@ lion people do not have suff@@ ici@@ ent access to clean drinking water .
more and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need .
centr@@ aliz@@ ed systems of artific@@ ial water management can@@ not sol@@ ve this problem .
we need de-@@ centr@@ aliz@@ ed systems of natural water management .
we are in tam@@ era peace research center in southern portugal , where a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape has been in development since summer 2007 .
bern@@ d muller is responsible for tam@@ era 's ec@@ ological research work .
in 2007 the community of tam@@ era still had the question whether a site of this size threaten@@ ed by deser@@ tific@@ ation could provi@@ de food , water and energy for 300 people .
we vis@@ ited sep@@ p hol@@ zer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water lands@@ cape .
sep@@ p hol@@ zer , an austri@@ an mountain far@@ mer , is a well-@@ known speci@@ alist and vision@@ ary for per@@ macul@@ ture and lands@@ cape heal@@ ing .
water is always at the core of his work .
for me water is the most important capital .
wh@@ er@@ ever it 's possible , you should cre@@ ate reten@@ tion sp@@ aces and collec@@ t the rain water and re-@@ learn with the water how to main@@ tain a balance .
this is the most important thing because once you 've created the right hydr@@ ological balance ,
70 % of the work is done .
ou help rich veget@@ ation to dev@@ el@@ op , diver@@ sity e@@ cause nature can reve@@ al itself and dev@@ el@@ op in the right way .
trav@@ eling through the world i have not seen a single situation , nation or land in which the development of a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape would not give the first important heal@@ ing impul@@ ses .
in many parts of the world , coun@@ tries are not able to feed their population anymore . they have been unable to main@@ tain their natural wild@@ life for a long time .
as a consul@@ tant in many coun@@ tries
sep@@ p hol@@ zer sees the consequence of de@@ forest@@ ation , mon@@ ocul@@ ture , over@@ graz@@ ing and industrial agriculture .
all these fac@@ tors destroy the natural water balance .
the so@@ il is dr@@ ying out . water is being lost and the reten@@ tion space , the natural water stor@@ age system of the earth , is becoming dry and the flora and fauna dis@@ appear .
in the end the land will turn into desert or burn e@@ cause it 's so dry .
you can see these problems happening all over the world , bringing huge catastro@@ phes .
and the heavy ra@@ ins come anyway .
what happens then ?
the water rus@@ hes down the slo@@ pes because the dry so@@ il does not absor@@ b the water .
when the so@@ il is hot@@ ter than the falling rain it rej@@ ec@@ ts the water .
only when the so@@ il is cool@@ er , when the veget@@ ation is giving shadow then it at@@ trac@@ ts the water and lets it se@@ ep in .
this is the construction site for a new water reten@@ tion space in tam@@ era .
wh@@ er@@ ever you work with so@@ il you can read the signs of ero@@ sion .
top@@ so@@ il should actually form a thick , living layer everywhere on the ground which en@@ ables rain@@ water to fil@@ ter in .
but , this layer has been ero@@ ded away .
now the top@@ so@@ il lies in lay@@ ers many met@@ ers thick in the bottom of valle@@ ys or is found as mud in ri@@ vers .
the surface of fields and sites higher up is dep@@ let@@ ed and bar@@ ren .
de-@@ centr@@ aliz@@ ed water reten@@ tion lands@@ cap@@ es give the water time to fil@@ ter back into the earth body .
people always have the same questions , always the same wor@@ ries , where will all this water come from ?
in such dust@@ y dry so@@ il without stre@@ ams or a river .
how can i build a lake here ?
people have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the cat@@ ch@@ ment area and the rain , the bles@@ sing of the water in the right way .
when i use the cat@@ ch@@ ment area , there@@ upon , the lake will fill very quickly .
how much water can change a lands@@ cape in a short time .
we can see here , compar@@ ing tam@@ era before the creation of lake 1 and today .
water reten@@ tion lands@@ cap@@ es can be built everywhere .
anywhere on earth .
a water reten@@ tion space must not be se@@ aled with concre@@ te or plastic .
it is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the nar@@ ro@@ west point of a valley .
you dig a dit@@ ch until you reach an imper@@ me@@ able layer .
on that solid ground you ap@@ ply layer after layer of fine material , like mo@@ ist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water bar@@ rier .
this water bar@@ rier is the core of the dam .
for the outside of the dam i take course material , it doesn 't have to be den@@ se and wat@@ er-@@ proof . of course ,
i will also have to comp@@ act it by driving on it and rolling it .
and like this , i build the whole dam , the water bar@@ rier in the core nd on the outside in a slo@@ pe of 1 to 2 , 1 meter up and 2 met@@ ers along , like this i build the two lay@@ ers together , up to the top .
the water reten@@ tion sp@@ aces have win@@ ding banks , shal@@ low and deep zones , a diverse veget@@ ation of water pl@@ ants and are built alig@@ ned to the pre@@ v@@ ail@@ ing wind direction this way the water is always moving , is en@@ rich@@ ed with oxy@@ gen ,
the water in a water reten@@ tion lands@@ cape st@@ ays fresh and alive by itself .
since we created the first reten@@ tion space , we can already keep much of the water from the winter rain@@ falls on the land .
in this way in can un@@ fold its full heal@@ ing capac@@ ity , the wild@@ life is respon@@ ding and is returning and the veget@@ ation is reco@@ vering .
we can plant fruit trees again , the forest@@ s reco@@ ver and we can grow our food for people and for animals in the direct surro@@ und@@ ings of the first reten@@ tion space .
the water which used to run away and which is now sto@@ red here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole gro@@ und@@ water system .
in the first year , a spring develop@@ ed below this lake which now gives water thro@@ ugh@@ out the year .
since we built this first dam , we no longer have such big vari@@ ations with a lot of flo@@ wing water in winter when it 's rain@@ ing and dro@@ ugh@@ ts in the summer .
we have a more constant water situation thro@@ ugh@@ out the year , which is of course a huge benef@@ it for nature .
nature shows you how this works , you just have to ask her , have to contact her , to communic@@ ate with her , then you will be fine anywhere on earth .
ask nature , think with her and not against her .
put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need .
make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen .
a forest garden is a three dimension@@ al garden of use@@ ful pl@@ ants .
so there 's trees , shr@@ ub@@ s , ground cover pl@@ ants , per@@ en@@ ni@@ al pl@@ ants all desig@@ ned to maxim@@ ise benefici@@ al inter@@ actions and minim@@ ize competition , desig@@ ned to be sust@@ ain@@ able in the long term by having pl@@ ants that feed other pl@@ ants by having pl@@ ants for be@@ es to sust@@ ain a pol@@ lin@@ ating population ,
sust@@ ain@@ able from other ways too , because most of the pl@@ ants are per@@ en@@ ni@@ al , you know trees or smaller pl@@ ants and so the so@@ il is not dug most of the time and not dig@@ ging the so@@ il is really important in term of sust@@ ain@@ ability
because every time you dig the so@@ il , a lot of carbon goes into the air .
this is chinese dog@@ wood , which is as you can see , a fantast@@ ic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edi@@ ble fruit which fol@@ lows later in the year .
apart from food , there are various other things you can grow and i do in this forest garden so i include medi@@ cin@@ al pl@@ ants ,
i include pl@@ ants for dying , for bas@@ ke@@ try use , pl@@ ants for fi@@ bers , there are of course a lot of bee pl@@ ants , sometimes pl@@ ants are here speci@@ fic@@ ally for be@@ es , so you might look at a particular plant in this forest garden
and i won 't neces@@ sar@@ ily har@@ v@@ est that plant myself it might have a system function in ter@@ ms of fe@@ eding another plant , or it might be here speci@@ fic@@ ally for be@@ es because if flowers are at a good time of year for be@@ es
and so on . so there is pl@@ ants for all sources of different uses .
there 's ... i think forest gar@@ dens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gar@@ dens .
of course ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am agriculture of course is completely depen@@ dent on oil , and you know what happens to oil will have a big effect and of course the oil price will may certainly go up and up over the de@@ ca@@ des to come ,
because , you know , dem@@ and will ex@@ ce@@ ed sup@@ ply . in this country particularly , you know , tree ... you know , far@@ mers don 't tend to know much about trees and fore@@ sters don 't know much about far@@ ming and agro@@ fore@@ str@@ y which is kind of in the middle of the two
there@@ fore is quite ... seems quite difficult for people and far@@ mers to access because , you know , they are not comfortable with trees .
so that 's a potential problem that could slow down , you know , the implement@@ ation of more agro@@ fore@@ str@@ y based systems on far@@ ming .
but i think it needs to happen and i think slowly it will happen but ...
i think it will take ... un@@ fortun@@ al@@ ety i think it will take a crisis or two , you know a serious crisis or two , to actually jol@@ t the powers of be into actually you know , making it happen quick@@ er .
this is one of my main sal@@ ad leaves from the forest garden , it 's the young le@@ af you use , this kind of le@@ af , not the old one , the old ones would be tou@@ gh .
an interesting parallel to times which may be coming you know , when in the cold war years the so@@ viet union did a lot of fruit bre@@ eding because they wanted to be self suff@@ ici@@ ent in fruit , you know , they didn 't want to have to im@@ port fruit from a long distance ,
well ty@@ pic@@ ally from , you know , the west .
and so they did a lot of interesting fruit bre@@ eding , this is one of the pl@@ ants they bre@@ d in fact , and you know that has a parallel in that ... of course in the moment , as a country , you know , we im@@ port a lot of our food and there is no reason why we couldn 't , more or less ,
grow most of it here .
and of course that 's got to be sensible from our sust@@ ain@@ ability and our res@@ ili@@ ence aspec@@ ts , it 's got to be sensible and our govern@@ ments haven 't got it yet .
forest gar@@ dens are res@@ ili@@ ent because of the ... because of the diver@@ sity , really .
so , it 's diver@@ sity of structure so lots of different pl@@ ants at different level@@ s but also diver@@ sity of species , so this forest garden has about 550 species in it , which is probably more than most because i am doing a lot of research and experiment@@ ing as well ,
but , it 's very common for forest gar@@ dens to have 200 species and , you know , the major@@ ity of which would be food pl@@ ants you know which ... to ask when we 're used to , you know , eating 20 types of veg@@ etab@@ les or something ,
you know if you 're talking about 200 types of food plant , people , initi@@ ally , might be slightly overwhel@@ med , but actually ...
i regard that as actually pro@@ ving much more normal than re@@ lying on 20 you know i think ... if you look at if you look at our near relat@@ ives , things like or@@ ang@@ ut@@ ans they regular@@ ly eat 400 different types of le@@ af and fruit ,
they know everyone , they recognize every one , you know they know exactly what they are picking that 's no reason we couldn 't do the same .
and i susp@@ ect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more res@@ ili@@ ent people as well .
bam@@ bo@@ os are fantast@@ ically use@@ ful pl@@ ants and of course in china and japan or other parts of asia they use bam@@ bo@@ o for more things that you could think of .
this one is growing about 20 cm a day at the moment , because of this warm weather so ... and you can actually hear them growing , bam@@ bo@@ os are the only pl@@ ants i can claim to have heard growing because when it 's growing that fast and you put your ear near the top
you can hear the fi@@ bers un@@ fur@@ ling and cr@@ ack@@ ling away .
so , if i just cut the top of that , and cut it down in the middle , it 's very interesting inside , you 'll see ... you can see what are going to be the no@@ des which are these bits on the bam@@ bo@@ o cane
and everything inside this white or light green is edi@@ ble , so you pe@@ el of the ou@@ ter leaves and then the inside bit is edi@@ ble you normally steam that ... just steam it for 5 or 10 minutes and then ... because they 're normally bitter raw .
this garden is now 16 years old and ... i 've certainly seen i 've seen clim@@ ate changes in that time main@@ ly , you know , increas@@ ed aver@@ age temper@@ atures and fe@@ wer spring fro@@ sts .
dry springs is something that most far@@ mers hate because they 've just sa@@ wed all their spring cro@@ ps , or hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ ists for that matter , you know , and dry weather is just what they don 't want in spring so that can be quite sever@@ e in ter@@ ms of growing ann@@ ual pl@@ ants
so , you know , obviously if you 're growing per@@ en@@ ni@@ al pl@@ ants a dry spring is , more or less ir@@ relev@@ ant you know , won 't have very much effect at all and simil@@ arly , you know , extre@@ mes of weather at other times of year are gon@@ na have much less effect
on per@@ en@@ ni@@ al cro@@ ps than on annu@@ als as a rule .
fung@@ i are probably the most important organis@@ ms of all in this forest garden , and of course most of the time we don 't see it because they are under the so@@ il surface and ... the fung@@ i i am talking about are my@@ cor@@ r@@ hiz@@ al fung@@ i
which are benefici@@ al fung@@ i that form relation@@ ships with almost all plant ro@@ ots .
and they do some amazing things :
when they form an association with plant ro@@ ots they bas@@ ically give the plant hard to get nu@@ tri@@ ents because fung@@ i can get those out of the ground much more eff@@ ici@@ ently than pl@@ ants and the plant gives the fung@@ i some su@@ gar@@ s in return , so it 's kind of sym@@ bio@@ sis .
but they do other things as well , they protect the plant from dis@@ eas@@ es and ... they move nu@@ tri@@ ents around in natural eco@@ systems and in something like a forest garden if there is more nu@@ tri@@ ents of one sort in one part of the so@@ il
and a lack in another part of the so@@ il , this fung@@ i will move it , physic@@ ally move it from one place to another and then the tree in another place will use it .
so that 's how things like nitro@@ gen from my nitro@@ gen fix@@ ing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fung@@ i move it for you .
the other thing that this fung@@ i do , which has really just been discovered in the last few years is crit@@ ical in se@@ quest@@ ering carbon in stable states in the so@@ il .
so without them you wouldn 't get se@@ quest@@ r@@ ation into the so@@ il .
and of course you don 't get these fung@@ i where you dig the so@@ il .
and this huge potential you know for se@@ quest@@ ering more carbon into the so@@ il you know ... and certainly you know , everybody seems to want to do that but ... but to do that , you gon@@ na have to move to a much more per@@ en@@ ni@@ al system .
this is po@@ ker@@ o@@ ot which is a quite a well known american wild edi@@ ble .
we@@ edy sho@@ ots that come through which tend to be at the beginning of june so it 's kind of very late spring cro@@ p really and the sho@@ ots come as really thick like you can see here .
you cook those and they have a sort of heal@@ thy as@@ parag@@ us flav@@ or to them really , really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al veget@@ able .
but pois@@ on@@ ous when it 's raw , you know , so you have to cook it but there 's lots of pl@@ ants you know that we eat have little po@@ ison in one state or another otherwise i think if po@@ tat@@ o@@ es were discovered now they probably wouldn 't be allowed in this country
because you know green po@@ tat@@ o@@ es are quite pois@@ on@@ ous .
i mean my estim@@ ate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden .
i use a lot of arom@@ atic pl@@ ants down in my per@@ en@@ ni@@ al lay@@ ers so a lot of different side sau@@ ce of min@@ t for ex@@ ample and lem@@ on bal@@ m or o@@ reg@@ ano , and other her@@ bs some of which of course is har@@ vest@@ ed but ,
it 's doing some use@@ ful func@@ tions that 's some use@@ ful func@@ tions even if you don 't har@@ v@@ est it down this layer because you know they are rich in essenti@@ al o@@ ils , min@@ ts and other arom@@ atic pl@@ ants and essenti@@ al o@@ ils are anti bacter@@ ial and anti fung@@ al so having those in the under@@ story lay@@ ers should have a protec@@ tive effect you know for other pl@@ ants in term of reduc@@ ing bacter@@ ial dis@@ eas@@ es and fung@@ al dis@@ eas@@ es .
the med@@ lar is a fantast@@ ic fruit tree which a lot of people don 't know but you can see the young fruits here these grow to about 3-@@ 3.5 centi@@ met@@ ers diam@@ eter and ri@@ pen on the tree in warm sum@@ mers otherwise you pick them
at the first frost and taken in@@ doors and then they ri@@ pe in with are sort of very sweet sort of date , bak@@ ed apple type flav@@ or to them really nice edi@@ ble fruit ... and also , you know , again very low mainten@@ ance it doesn 't have any pest@@ s or dis@@ eas@@ es it just looks after itself .
mon@@ ocul@@ ture cro@@ ps have been domin@@ ating all agriculture research for hund@@ reds of years and even now you know ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am agriculture scienti@@ sts they don 't like looking at more than one cro@@ p in one place , it makes things very complic@@ ated for them .
this is si@@ chuan pe@@ pper which is obviously a commercial cro@@ p grown in china main@@ ly but it 's a shr@@ ub as you can see a lar@@ gel@@ y shr@@ ub and you can see it has just finished flo@@ wering it 's just starting to form the pep@@ per@@ cor@@ ns here
and each of those will form a ro@@ un@@ dish fruit so the black se@@ ed in the middle and a sort of pink shell round the outside .
it 's actually that pink shell which is the sp@@ ice you don 't have to use black pe@@ pper if you have something like this .
welcome to the new afrika shr@@ ine .
tonight fem@@ i ku@@ ti is going to be playing on stage his regular sunday jump .

we have about 2000 people on tu@@ es@@ days and thur@@ s@@ days at re@@ hear@@ s@@ als .
and it looks like many of them feel part of this place , feel like this is their home .
they feel like my life revol@@ ves around their life , they feel like they 're part of what 's going on here .
i just thought that if they feel part of it , why don 't i make everything open ?
so that i have no secrets when i am writing a song .
everybody 's here while i do it .
i feel comfortable because of the life i 'm living .
so ... i know them , it 's like a participation .
they 're all like " what 's on the next album ? . "
all of you vote for it .
i 'm confused myself .
tell me what you 'd love to say ...
let me tell you ...
can 't buy me and sho@@ ki , we want them on the album !
what we can do for you is this : we can vote democrat@@ ically .
democratic elections !
yes !
put your pen away , and be practic@@ al .
and so we say :
i say :
" sho@@ tan ? " yeah ...
everybody loves sho@@ tan .
no , so we can@@ not do that for all 18 . you 'll choose .
what you can do is , you can go find your sup@@ porter 's club .
write an official letter :
" this is what i want recor@@ ded ... "
" we con@@ test your presiden@@ cy ! "
you know you lost , even if you go to court !
go to court , you will see !
you can even appe@@ al !
yeni , can you explain what 's going on ?
some of us are protest@@ ing that our numbers didn 't go in the charts .
- you don 't agree with the choice ?
- no , not at all .
we 're compl@@ aining about a special number :
can 't buy me .
who dat man talking to ?
him think say him de@@ y talk to fool

we do not have to re@@ mind our@@ selves of the announ@@ cement of sho@@ tan , also known by the name she were .
do not throw any type of bever@@ age , including ... chelsea , beer , squ@@ ad@@ ron , st@@ out .
if you think i 'm a squ@@ ad@@ ron leader , all you have to do is go to the barr@@ acks .
do not throw your don simon or ar@@ aga .
whatever may be the drink , do not sp@@ lash water on your fellow human be@@ ings , you wouldn 't do it at home .
can you throw it on your father ?
you can 't .
if tin@@ un@@ bu came here , you would be shaking .
as i was saying , do not !
do not throw water on him !
obviously you are too drunk to listen to my announ@@ cement , so , let us continue ...
are you crazy ?
have you lost your heads ?
sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan
we don tell you many times before
say na you go come to regret
so the government of o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo
go carry all of us go for hell
you carry your pon@@ pose self about
you say you no want to hear
now everything don scat@@ ter for your face
senior mu@@ go sho@@ tan o
sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan , sho@@ tan
they enjoyed it , especially during sunday jump .
did you see how full it was ?
everybody was happy , enjoying themselves , and jum@@ ping and everything , which is good .
and then they relax , you know ?
because in nigeria , life is not easy for anyone .
cost of living , there 's no lights , no water , the scho@@ ols are poor ...
it 's not easy .
the sal@@ aries aren 't paid , pen@@ sions aren 't paid , so everything isn 't going smooth@@ ly .
we want to have somewhere you can sit , forget everything , go there for some time . i think it 's great .
fem@@ i 's doing a lot for them that way .
that 's another way of getting to the people .
if he contin@@ ues like that , there 's no trouble .
there 's no trouble in the shr@@ ine when he 's there .
everything 's cool and organiz@@ ed .
wh@@ ere@@ as with fe@@ la , it was tou@@ gh .
there were always problems there .
there were always problems .
education doesn 't work , hospit@@ als don 't work proper@@ ly , people are poor , police aren 't paid ...
i mean , no security , life is totally a mess here .
the papers tell us a different story from the reality of our lives .
a lot of people are in pain here now .
even me , i 'm comfortable , but when you see so much po@@ ver@@ ty , how can you be happy ?
after 40 years of indepen@@ dence , there is no area in nigeria where you have light constant@@ ly , water running constant@@ ly .
and we call our@@ selves independent ?
indepen@@ dence means you 're independent of asking for fav@@ ors .
we can 't say we are independent , because we are still re@@ lying on many things to keep our country going .
i wan@@ na be free from all these yeye polit@@ ics
i wan@@ na be free from all these yeye polit@@ ici@@ ans
i wan@@ na be free from all these corrup@@ t mon@@ sters
because of the ide@@ als of fem@@ i an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti , he has always found a positive way to project the black man .
we believe in black power , and that we can be trust@@ ed .
we want to con@@ vey that afric@@ ans can mind themselves proper@@ ly .
we want to do away with the my@@ ths in black ment@@ ality that the black man can 't do what he wants to ach@@ ie@@ ve .
we 're trying to say things can work in africa , if our lead@@ ers do the right thing .
but most of all , if no one can do that , we should free our@@ selves .
i think that fem@@ i has found a better way to project this and continue fe@@ la 's hope to project the black image right .
to try to cre@@ ate another way to see that things can work in black africa .
i wan@@ na be free from all these corrup@@ t mon@@ sters
we@@ y want to cho@@ p man
the king is dead
na dem ko@@ oku@@ ma kill the king for polit@@ ical reasons
dem no fit talk as e be
oya back to polit@@ ics
dem start to sch@@ eme for the same corrup@@ tion and thie@@ f
no plan for you and me
when we de@@ y sleep
de@@ y dem de@@ y meet to plan their evil strategi@@ es
to control our re@@ sources
african lead@@ ers
and their foreign counter@@ parts
e bi like from these evil mon@@ sters
we shall never be free
i wan@@ na be free i said every day
every night
i ask myself
why , why , why
chee because fe@@ la die
that is why dem de@@ y try to
conf@@ use i and everybody mind
last sunday , i had my ber@@ et .
it was stol@@ en today .
what do they want ?
- they st@@ ole my ber@@ et .
- sanc@@ tion@@ ed .
what do you mean , sanc@@ tion@@ ed ?
i told you they st@@ ole it !
did you hear him ?
i lent mine to him , over there .
they only gave me the shirt .
is@@ oko , anyone give you a ber@@ et ?
he said he doesn 't have it .
i 'm wearing michael 's ber@@ et .
i had a ber@@ et , last week .
each time we go out in this uniform we hear people y@@ ell :
" fem@@ i 's child ! "
or " the shr@@ ine boys ! "
they do recognize us as one of the " shr@@ ine boys . "
fe@@ la , himself has already made the shr@@ ine popular for all the afric@@ ans .
so when his son took over for him , people respect him like they respec@@ ted his father .
when we put on this uniform we look as if we 're close to fem@@ i .
it 's hard for people to see fem@@ i , so when we wear this uniform , they say " this is fem@@ i 's security . "
that 's why we 're proud to wear this uniform .
i 'm proud to be working at the shr@@ ine , i 'll always be proud .
when i 'm going home , a polic@@ eman will ask me :
" where are you coming from at this hour of the night ? "
i tell him i 'm working security at the shr@@ ine .
he asks if i have my id card ,
i tell him i don 't have one .
this is the symbol of where i work .
as long as they can see this , they know that i work for fem@@ i .
so they allow me to go .
if dem want to hear we go tell them plenty things
if dem want to see we go show them many things
we@@ y the african man we@@ y the african woman
find it very difficult to succe@@ ed
na today dem no say mu@@ bo@@ tu no good
she na today dem no say company no good
see this african lead@@ ers
dem don kill all their people finish
look again o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo don kill nig@@ eri@@ ans
no not o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo and his p@@ adi pad@@ dies
dem de@@ y try to give us different reason
to tell us say o@@ bas@@ an@@ jo no guilty
na today dem no say charles taylor no good
na today dem no say mu@@ gabe no good
my son omor@@ im@@ ade af@@ ol@@ abi an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti
see those african lead@@ ers rol@@ ari
dem don kill all their people finish
as we ou@@ ght to know the reason why
the african man and the african woman find it difficult to su ... su ...
because you like to drink beer too much !
you like to su@@ ck bre@@ asts too much !
you 'd like to be su@@ cking pus@@ sy too much !
... succe@@ ed !
with the dancing ... with the dancing , the anger , the suff@@ ering you still find joy and peace .
we 're letting so much frustration out of our system .
and all that is a language , without talking .
there is communication on that . i go to sleep ,
i can wake up the next day , move forward without stress .
if my body 's aching me or my girlfriend or ...
why do we need to have stress ?
and i hope the people who come here have that same kind of vi@@ be .
i mean , what is life ?
to have peace of mind , know what to do the next day , how to deal with life .
so if the shr@@ ine can do that to everybody , or any@@ body , i won 't call it a church or mos@@ que ,
i 'll just say it 's life , shr@@ ine .
i won 't say god is here , god is not . god is here , but he 's everywhere .
i will not go under the um@@ bre@@ lla of religion , i 'll make it spiritu@@ al . it 's limit@@ less .
i will not say :
" this is where to be , " but " at least you can be . "
key@@ board !
yeah , i play the base guitar .
i dance .
he pl@@ ays guitar .
i dance on stage .
i play the trum@@ pet .
i play the shak@@ ers .
i 'm a per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist .
this is the band leader !
if i can take this country , then africa is settled .
once there 's a good government in 1 country , they 'll be liber@@ ated .
only one straight , progres@@ sive clean government that knows what it 's doing .
no diplom@@ acy , no comprom@@ ises ,
and no marx@@ is@@ m-@@ len@@ in@@ ism , no capit@@ alism .
afric@@ an@@ ism !
the time don come
for me to talk
before i talk
make i thank everyone
for the support you na give my family
during our troubles
you my friends una de@@ y with me nin@@ et@@ y-@@ seven
i shall never forget
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ seven the pain ! the sor@@ row !
i want to thank you my friends
j@@ ig@@ bol@@ o , ji@@ j@@ ig@@ bol@@ o , j@@ ig@@ bol@@ o !
oh yes i remember
the day all of us we gathered
to pay our respect to the
one and only fe@@ la
we carry am go him house
before him spirit go for el@@ ed@@ um@@ are palace i say
together we wal@@ ka
carry fe@@ la oh
for those we@@ y no know na that de@@ y them know
say the people them love fe@@ la oh
together we wal@@ ka
i 've never seen any@@ body in this whole country or in all of africa ...
only 2 people are walking the streets of power :
n@@ kru@@ mah and my mother !
that 's what i 'm talking about !
all these dirty polit@@ ici@@ ans who sit on their as@@ ses !
the young and the old the strong and the weak
the rich and the poor
them gathered to carry fe@@ la
together we wal@@ ka
and then as we want start to relax
we no know our problems
just start from nowhere we hear
cousin fr@@ an just pass
just like that she die
we start to wonder why
enough is enough
the people start to talk
the problems don too much
again as we start to relax and then suddenly we hear
na the matter of my sister ' sola come make all of us weak for body
again we ask our@@ selves why
for she was too young to die
as we de@@ y cry na so we de@@ y try
we de@@ y strugg@@ le to save her life
the doc@@ tors them de@@ y lie
them want to get money to survive
the thing we@@ y de@@ y pain me pass

music is the way for us . music is the thing of the future .
music is the weapon of the future .
fem@@ i takes care of everybody , street boys , everybody .
we live okay here .
in nigeria , only fem@@ i takes care of everybody .
he 's concerned about po@@ ver@@ ty , concerned about corrup@@ tion , the poor ...
in nigeria he 's a great man , fem@@ i an@@ ik@@ ul@@ ap@@ o-@@ ku@@ ti , and he did many songs to let people know
so we have a lot of music to let you know what is going on in nigeria and africa .
fem@@ i 's making people know , and wants to know more .
if you want to know more , come to the shr@@ ine .
that 's all .
he 's like a proph@@ et who has come to make people realize ...
he 's a proph@@ et who makes people realize that they must fight for their rights , like one of his best tracks , demo@@ crazy .
and now we realize that the government makes us mad , when you get mad , that 's sho@@ tan .
sho@@ tan , it 's like the destruc@@ tive kid the mother didn 't want to have .
that 's what our government made us be .
but thank god , we have the shr@@ ine , we have surviv@@ al .
and we are ready to serve the true proph@@ et .
- not true ?
- it 's true !
we do something for our@@ selves !
we want to move further ,
we want to go to university !
but our presi@@ dents only watch themselves , rule themselves . and the country 's getting worse and worse .
pr@@ ices always go up , food , people are dying !
food pr@@ ices .
no light , no good education , no good nothing !
mr. president , we 're beg@@ ging you !
we fight for our rights , man !
we 're fighting together , doing something for our@@ selves !
for our@@ selves , for our lives !
fem@@ i ku@@ ti tells us how to think for our@@ selves .
because some people are milli@@ on@@ aires , while the country is going bad , bad !
the frustration is too much .
sometimes when i 'm walking i see the polic@@ em@@ en beat people like dogs .
the polic@@ em@@ en beat us like dogs .
not true ?
it 's true , man !
the afrika shr@@ ine be my neighbor@@ hood
every night , i 'm there at afrika shr@@ ine
the ladies do as they like at the shr@@ ine
everybody does as they like at the shr@@ ine
every night they meet at the afrika shr@@ ine
neighbor@@ hood
all afric@@ ans are my neighbor@@ s
the ladies like my neighbor@@ hood
the man we call fem@@ i is a proph@@ et .
we all serve him .
he 's given us the message to keep the place clean .
we make sure it 's clean .
we have found a survi@@ vor , we are pleased with him .
we are happy .
we are people from places like aj@@ eg@@ un@@ le and mus@@ hin , places where people go without eating .
we 're here , we found surviv@@ al with him .
we serve him .
that 's why this place is clean .
if i leave for 5 minutes , this place will be mes@@ sed up .
i must be here to make sure this place is clean .
so he 'll be pleased with me , and i 'll be happy he 's pleased .
bring me
bring me the man now
i believe right now there 's so much energy here .
and you can manipul@@ ate this energy for you .
my role is taking the energy of music and trans@@ forming it into dance .
if i ach@@ ie@@ ve that , it 's a force .
music is a powerful force .
i take that sound , truly , not tr@@ ick@@ ery or lies .
i take that energy and go po@@ w ...
and make people really go crazy .
how ?
it 's magic .
people ask me how i did it , i don 't know .
because i do the right thing , that energy is using me as a medium to express many things through music .
now that energy is a constant thing , 24 hours a day .
you can use that energy to understand , for many things .
say you have a head@@ ache , somebody will be able to just touch your head , you 'll feel a kind of ease because of the true love .
you take the energy : " you have a head@@ ache ? where ? "
and that person will have calm .
i beg live me

the fine things of life these people don 't see
their bad mind no gree make dem get better dream

whose rich harmon@@ ies and melo@@ dies
will truly bring peace

fem@@ i , don 't go !
the son of fe@@ la " baba 70 . "
don 't go !
i think it 's the most challen@@ ging place to compose .
if the shr@@ ine people love it , then i 'm not worried , really .
i 'm not really worried , because i 'm very crit@@ ical of myself . if i don 't like it , if i don 't feel something , i will not continue the work .
after the comple@@ tion of the shr@@ ine ,
i found that i was alone , and i just saw myself sin@@ king deep into music .
and on getting where i am in life , i found that the only friend i have , the only thing i can trust , is myself .
and it 's difficult to really trust yourself .
you don 't want to do something , then you do it .
the only thing i have confidence in , in my life , 100 % , is music .
even if you don 't give your life to music , music will take you over .
so , i just let myself go and wh@@ er@@ ever music takes me , so be it .
i have no wor@@ ries concer@@ ning that .
i 'm not sad .
i mean , i have peace .
sometimes i look anno@@ yed , it 's things around me , or things people said . i am a very happy man , very happy .
sometimes i love being alone , i love being in my own world because this world is crazy .
i don 't see anything in this world that makes sense .
you pre@@ fer to be alone ?
i feel saf@@ er that way .
don 't forget , i 'm not alone in that respect .
i have the force of music , running like a wild fo@@ un@@ tain in my head .
that alone , i am never at peace .
and i love the feeling music gives me .
i 'll never com@@ promise that , for nothing in this world .
nothing .
not even myself .
i will star@@ ve myself for music .
no way , can never give it up .
out of the way !
calm down !
out of the way !
may your future be bright !

a lot of stupid shit goes through your mind when you 're breaking out of prison .
but when the spot@@ light is on you and you 've got your nut@@ s in a vise , the only thing that matters is getting the fuck out .

huh ?
breathe !
breathe !
no , really , what 's going on here ?
she thinks i 'm a loser !
no , i doubt that 's true .
did you hear me , f@@ itz ?

i can 't have my fucking kid thinking his old man is a loser !
let 's work on this in the car !
i have to get the de@@ aler@@ ship back from those two car@@ bom@@ b-@@ istan@@ is .

richard has decided to make the baby proud , and buy back the de@@ aler@@ ship .
the de@@ aler@@ ship ?
ye@@ p .
over my dead body !
you said you didn 't want it .
first rule of business :
lie .
you should be proud too , ali , because you and the baby are having a positive effect on the fitz@@ patr@@ icks .
hey !
hey !
it 's true .
oh ...
what are you doing !
hey !
that 's my truck , man !
you can 't keep me here , you know .
this is a men 's prison .
i 'm a woman .
it is clearly a viol@@ ation of the , uh ...
geneva convention .
and if i actually get viol@@ ated , that 's another viol@@ ation .
so let me take a wild guess ...
you just happened to be in the neigh@@ bour@@ hood on the night that your brother and father broke out of ja@@ il ?

jane quim@@ by .
my life is a little complic@@ ated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chand@@ ler murray .
the only problem , they think i 'm an adult .
now i am jug@@ g@@ ling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she 's a little sh@@ ady .
i 'm afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you 're happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fel@@ las .
here 's how it 's going down .
are you rob@@ bing this place , tommy ?
let 's go !
let 's go !
a couple months at new hall youth deten@@ tion might give mr. nut@@ ter ample time to think about those mist@@ akes and their implic@@ ations .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , jan@@ ey .
it 's not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don 't .
i can 't talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i 'm just gon@@ na say it .
it 's you , jan@@ ey .
jane .
jane !
let 's go .
you 're gon@@ na be late for school again , tru@@ ant .
that gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ or of yours is gon@@ na come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
ben .
it 's a little weird that you call your girlfriend " miss shaw . "
oh , you mean rita .
hey .
are you really that busy ?
yes .
and no .
i 'm nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy 's different ?
what if he doesn 't want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juven@@ ile deten@@ tion center , not a br@@ ain@@ wash@@ ing camp .
you 'll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i 'm waiting .
bat@@ ed breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , " it 's you . "
- it 's you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn 't know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it 's been playing on a lo@@ op in my head .
" it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . " what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-@@ base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romant@@ ically ?
no .
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don 't think that 's it .
but i guess it can be .
i don 't know .
maybe it is .
i don 't know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he 's my best friend and i don 't want to run the risk of ru@@ in@@ ing that , right ?
- i can 't answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , jan@@ ey .
jane by design 1@@ x@@ 11
- the re@@ placement original air date june 5 , 2012
that 's it ?
yeah , i mean , i don 't know what else to say .
it was pretty un@@ event@@ ful .
you were in a juven@@ ile deten@@ tion center .
so ?
so , was it scar@@ y ?
were the guards mean ?
did you make any friends ?
how was the food ?
did you ...
jane . look .
i wasn 't in al@@ cat@@ raz or anything , okay ?
i just ...
i 'd rather talk about something else , okay ?
okay .
maybe we should talk about , you know ...
yeah , you !
so , what about you ?
what 's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since i 've been away ?
oh . nothing , really .
- how 's jeremy ?
- jeremy ?
yeah , you guys are together , right ?
no .
we 've never been together .
he doesn 't even know that i 'm in high school .
and we work together .
i could never do that .
speaking of work .
how is it ?
well , things have been crazy ever since india got fired .
gray has been using me for everything .
it 's nut@@ s .
and she 's been through at least a dozen people to fill india 's job .
wow .
that 's a lot of people .
tell me about it .
and you should see the stuff that she 's having me do .
i can 't even believe it .
i mean , don 't get me wrong ,
i love being cre@@ ativ@@ ely involved at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er ...
you okay ?
let 's just say to be back here again .
and this place same way about me .
don 't worry about them .
and , billy ...
yeah ?
are we okay ?
shouldn 't we , talk or something ?
you 've been talking non-@@ stop ever since we got in the car , jane .
right .
i mean , about ...
we 're good .
yeah .
there 's nothing for us to talk about , okay ?
unless you want to talk about that .
you have got to be kid@@ ding me .
ye@@ p .
l@@ ulu and nick .
they 've been an it@@ em ever since you left school .
looks like it 's just back to being the two of us .
yeah .
the two of us .
jane , i have to be honest .
i 'm a little disap@@ pointed .
disap@@ pointed ?
i 'm just surprised .
that 's all .
this progress report does not refle@@ ct the acade@@ mic performance of the jane quim@@ by that i know .
your gr@@ ades are sli@@ pping in every class but ceram@@ ics .
well , that 's good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceram@@ ics .
- ou@@ ch .
and it 's not just your gr@@ ades .
your atten@@ dance last month ?
let 's just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
this intern@@ ship is interfer@@ ing with your life .
your gr@@ ades aren 't what they used to be , you have multiple tar@@ dies and ab@@ sen@@ ces and that just can 't happen .
i know , i know .
but i 'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i 'm already here .
this is my life .
it 's just an intern@@ ship , jane .
it 's not .
i 'm working with design@@ ers and i 'm being ex@@ posed to this whole world of fashion that you can 't learn in a class@@ room .
i 'm living it every day .
you can 't buy that kind of experience , you know ?
fine .
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn 't im@@ prove , i can 't sign off on the intern@@ ship program for you next sem@@ ester .
especially if you 're not ...
wait .
are you tex@@ ting someone right now ?
uh , what ?
no .
i am just ty@@ ping a remin@@ der to myself to shape up at school .
st@@ at .
i promise i 'll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
sorry .
i know this might sound har@@ sh , but you 've been an incredi@@ ble disap@@ pointment , sally .
it 's suz@@ y .
your work has been l@@ ack@@ lu@@ ster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er , you 've yet to show any real promise .
but i 've only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i 'm afraid .
you 're fired .
that 'll be all .
what ?
that 's five this month , gray .
well , it 's been harder to re@@ place india than i might 've realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i 'm not worried .
i have a new prosp@@ ect in mind .
someone young and un@@ expected .
someone not box@@ ed in by years of design experience .
you don 't mean ...
you 're not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next ap@@ pointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
marty@@ n !
gray , darling !
so . classic .
clean .
powerful .
it 's a whole new del@@ icious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i 'm afraid i don 't .
i love it .
you 're a gen@@ ius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hat@@ s does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that 's twice as busy since india left ?
i think we 're all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
'@@ cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , " over whom ? " and , " in pum@@ ps or flat@@ s ? "
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don 't get your ho@@ pes up .
hey .
what can i do for you , mu@@ ff@@ in ?
that 's a " no " on kissing at work and the whole mu@@ ff@@ in thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn 't quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we 're on the same page .
so , what 's up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i 'm just a little concerned .
don 't worry .
she 's good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i 'm concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she 's falling behind .
i think this intern@@ ship is just too demand@@ ing on her , don 't you ?
actually , i kind of think it 's been good .
but i promise i 'll make sure she st@@ ays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depen@@ ds on it ?
b@@ ingo .
i know you 've all been working tre@@ mendo@@ usly hard lat@@ ely .
but you 're gon@@ na have to work tre@@ mendo@@ usly harder .
don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er has been selec@@ ted to collabor@@ ate on a cap@@ s@@ ule collection with one of the world 's most famous lux@@ ury department sto@@ res ,
har@@ ro@@ ds .
that is , unless we blow it .
and we can@@ not blow it .
understood ?
okay .
didn 't i fire you ?
no .
oh .
see me in my office after@@ wards .
the style director as@@ signed to over@@ see our har@@ ro@@ ds collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one prior@@ ity ?
carter ?
um , to im@@ press the style director and en@@ sure har@@ ro@@ ds is confid@@ ent that don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er has what it takes ?
precis@@ ely .
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no excep@@ tions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
now .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn 't see .
because apparently , we 're all supposed to be working tre@@ mendo@@ usly harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suz@@ y ?
- right .
oh , my gos@@ h .
i 'm turning into gray , aren 't i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i 'm going to tell you something and i need you not to re@@ act , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i 'm serious , jane .
okay .
gray is giving you india 's old job .
what ?
me ?
no reaction .
right .
take over india 's job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
jan@@ ey ?
you ready ?
almost !
i 'll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind hand@@ ing me the milk ?
yes .
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your to@@ ast is ready .
wait .
you 're actually considering this ?
no .
yes ?
i don 't know .
i mean , taking india 's old job would be the opportunity of a life@@ time .
how could i say no ?
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you 'd really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
maybe .
why ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i 'm good .
oh , you 're good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
whatever .
- so , now you 're mad at me ?
yeah .
i am .
billy , you 've been shut@@ ting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won 't even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for star@@ ters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , jan@@ ey .
nothing ?
that 's your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that 's it .
there 's nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i 'm different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it 's not for the better .
i didn 't ask you , jane .
fine !
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don 't know , ben .
maybe i took your ad@@ vice and i tried to talk to him about the whole " it 's you " thing and maybe it back@@ fired .
sorry about that .
i 'm worried about billy .
it can 't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don 't know , maybe an activit@@ y or something ?
like math@@ le@@ tes .
or ch@@ ess club .
- i 'm being serious , rita .
- so am i .
come on .
ch@@ ess ?
math@@ le@@ tes ?
what , do you want him to be more of an out@@ cast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were ador@@ able doing it .
shoot .
vice principal jen@@ kins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what 're you nau@@ gh@@ ty kids up to this fine morning ?
nau@@ gh@@ ty ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said " mo@@ p " !
- and i 'll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jen@@ kins .
good morning , rita .
and ...
ben .
that was close .
no .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what 's gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kid@@ ding ?
we o@@ oz@@ e chem@@ ist@@ ry .
don 't say o@@ oz@@ e .
hi .
hi .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bear@@ ings back .
- that 's good .
- ye@@ p .
so , what 's been going on with you ?
sorry .
stupid question .
so , you and fad@@ den , huh ?
how 's that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you 're precipit@@ ating .
- excuse me ?
- your cal@@ cium is starting to form a precipit@@ ate .
you should dry out the cryst@@ als .
oh .
um ...
thanks .
- busy , huh ?
- mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
you 're not gon@@ na cut me any sl@@ ack here , are you ?
maybe .
but just a little .
okay .
i guess i deserve that .
i 'm really sorry , jane .
for what it 's worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it 's fine .
really , i 'm just distr@@ acted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and l@@ ulu seem very happy .
yeah .
the thing is ...
i ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
oh .
yeah .
thanks .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
thanks .
first day back .
how 're you doing ?
i 'm fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i 'm adjust@@ ing .
no , i just thought now that you 're back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive out@@ let .
for what ?
i don 't know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
such as ...
how about football ?
seriously ?
yeah .
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you 're a little str@@ ing@@ y , but you 're probably very el@@ us@@ ive .
hard to t@@ ack@@ le .
baseball ?
oh , my .
are you kid@@ ding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help re@@ ac@@ clim@@ ate me or whatever it is that you 're trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not really the team sport type .
are you sure you 're doing okay ?
i 'm fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i 'd like to .
- i 'd pre@@ fer if we didn 't .
excuse me .
coming through .
i have to leave school because of an emergen@@ cy at work and rita can 't know under any circum@@ stances because then i would lose my intern@@ ship and that can 't happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don 't think so .
- no way .
what ?
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don 't really like to do this sort of thing , but can 't you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cr@@ amp@@ s , anything .
i don 't like lying to rita .
it 's just a teen@@ y-@@ tiny little white lie .
and that 's how it all starts .
that 's correct .
fine .
i don 't need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
o@@ ops .
sorry .
sorry .
that 's okay .
hey , i 'm actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you deli@@ vering those to ?
you think i 'm a flower deli@@ very guy ?
i did .
a second ago .
but now i 'm a little un@@ sure .
they 're for gray chand@@ ler murray .
oh . great .
i 'm gray 's assistant .
jane .
so i can just take those to her .
i 'd rather give them to her myself if that 's okay .
the thing is gray 's not exactly the hand deli@@ very type .
what type is she ?
she 's more of a " don 't bother me with that kind of crap " type .
so , if you 're not the flower deli@@ very guy , who are you ?
eli .
i have an ap@@ pointment with gray .
today ?
no , it 's tomorrow .
i just thought i 'd get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn 't laugh .
well , it wasn 't laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn 't have any ap@@ point@@ ments today .
well , she called me directly .
gray ?
called you ?
on the phone ?
yeah .
crazy , right ?
so , what is this ap@@ pointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you 're inter@@ vie@@ wing for it ?
yeah .
are you gon@@ na point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gos@@ h .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
tips ?
yeah , you know , like ad@@ vice for the interview .
oh , um , just don 't take anything gray says to you person@@ ally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you 're saying she 's mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she 's just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you 're here !
oh !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven 't seen you in a while .
and i know lili@@ es are your favorite .
jane , i see you 've met my neph@@ ew , eli .
yeah , we ...
neph@@ ew ?
yeah .
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you 're warm and gorgeous and incredi@@ bly tal@@ ent@@ ed .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
neph@@ ew ?
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don 't like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray 's neph@@ ew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india 's new re@@ placement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
no .
i ...
sp@@ it it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india 's job .
you are .
where 's jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her depar@@ ture .
what 'd she say ?
she said some things about cr@@ amp@@ s .
cr@@ amp@@ s .
cr@@ amp@@ s . you know , lady stuff .
i 'm not that familiar with lady stuff , so i 'd really rather not discus@@ s it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she 'll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-@@ caf@@ f lat@@ te .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reserv@@ ation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were book@@ ed up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some str@@ ings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what 's this ?
- some sket@@ ches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the acces@@ sor@@ ies line .
i 'll take a look .
impres@@ sive .
you 're still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that 's nice .
hey .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
techn@@ ically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there 's no such thing .
okay , come on , i 'm serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quim@@ by .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it 's a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i 'm an assistant .
and the clo@@ s@@ est i 've come to stud@@ ying design is , i don 't know , the end@@ less hours i spent and fashion magaz@@ ines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more quali@@ fied and he 's ...
he 's nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you 've got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
thank you .
i just really don 't know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insan@@ e ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he 's back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn 't he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we 've talked about this .
you 're my men@@ tor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to ru@@ b it in .
all i 'm saying is i don 't know if it 's the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i 'm not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it 's nothing .
sorry .
thank you .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're welcome .
sup ?
wow !
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what 's going on with you ?
i was par@@ ched .
you 're avo@@ iding me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm trying to keep things discre@@ et .
between us .
you know ?
you 're lying to me about jane .
what ?
no .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cr@@ amp@@ s .
did not .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you 've got me really worried about these cold cr@@ amp@@ s .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going with you .
and if jane isn 't home sick in bed , that intern@@ ship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
now !
- what happened ?
the collec@@ tive brain power of you and me .
that 's what happened .
you said cr@@ amp@@ s , didn 't you ?
there 's no time for blame .
yes . i said cr@@ amp@@ s .
you just couldn 't stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she 's coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can 't you just call her ?
i 've called her like a dozen times .
it ke@@ eps going to vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail .
ben , it 's just the whole racing to save jane thing , it 's not really my problem anymore .
look .
i 'm not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us .
otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she 's my sister .
i can 't bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can 't com@@ pete with this guy .
trust me .
she 's not going to hire her neph@@ ew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn 't go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn 't exactly re@@ fin@@ ed like the rest of you extre@@ mely tal@@ ent@@ ed people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you 're already s@@ elling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i 'm just s@@ elling my stuff at po@@ p-@@ up sho@@ ps or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materi@@ als , but i love it .
and that 's what it 's all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he 's perfect .
he 's char@@ ming and tal@@ ent@@ ed and good@@ -@@ looking
he 's not that good@@ -@@ looking .
i 'm serious , jeremy .
there 's no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i 'm up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it 's a cour@@ tes@@ y , jane .
a family oblig@@ ation .
this is gray we 're talking about .
she 's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i 'm always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these pu@@ pp@@ ies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we 're going .
understood ?
understood .
and if i find out you are lying , we 're gon@@ na have a serious issue .
i 'm pleased to announ@@ ce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vac@@ an@@ cy left by india jour@@ da@@ in .
- it 's you .
- what ?
i 'm certain of it .
this person has pro@@ ven that they have excep@@ tional cre@@ ativ@@ ity and style .
this person is destin@@ ed to be a rising star here at don@@ o@@ van deck@@ er .
this person is ...
wait !
what , jane ?
i 'm sorry .
i just ...
i can 't .
can 't ?
i can 't do this .
i 'd like to take myself out of the running .
i 'm so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don 't think i 'm ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i 'm pleased to introdu@@ ce our ne@@ west designer ,
eli chand@@ ler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cr@@ amp@@ s , didn 't he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn 't think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your s@@ ick@@ bed .
what do you think 's faster right now ?
5@@ th or lex ?
we 're gon@@ na have to ...
you came for me .
i did .
and i 'm not gon@@ na let that be for nothing .
come on .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i 'm on my way to the house .
i 've stal@@ led as long as i can and i just can 't keep lying to rita .
your char@@ iot awa@@ its .
mm@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
drive .
now .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a short@@ cut .
- oh !
come on , jan@@ ey !
oh , wait .
paj@@ amas !
jane ?
jane ?
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i 'm feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cr@@ amp@@ s .
so i just needed to ...
double wh@@ am@@ my .
h@@ mm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i 'm sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole man@@ hunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for question@@ ing you , accus@@ ing you of lying .
i don 't know what got into me .
i think you 're just being the best gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ or in the history of gu@@ id@@ ance coun@@ sel@@ ors , that 's all .
thank you .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gos@@ h .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn 't even being offered ?
so embarras@@ sing .
it wasn 't so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad .
i coun@@ ted eight people cr@@ inging .
did you count me ?
okay .
nine .
i know you wanted that job .
honestly , i wasn 't ready to leave being a teen@@ ager behind just yet .
and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , jan@@ ey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you 'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , " it 's you , "
and i need to know if you meant ...
i meant
that it 's you , jan@@ ey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don 't want that to ever change .
because that 's what 's most important , right ?
yeah .
it is .
remember .
we must im@@ press this har@@ ro@@ ds style director at any cost .
don@@ o@@ van is depen@@ ding on us .
hello , lo@@ ser@@ s .

get in the car ! who are you ?
i 'm the man whose money you took . he 'll get done , so@@ oner or later . i made a call .
the vat man .
well done on bringing us the money . welcome to mor@@ oc@@ co .
help ! help ! for your own sake , i sug@@ gest you answer these questions tru@@ th@@ fully .
why are you on this boat ?
that 's ... er ... that 's all of us going on a f@@ ishing trip .
i remember that day ... happy times .
you are putting a bag in the car . what was it ?
probably f@@ ishing gear .
ba@@ x ?
quinn ?
tell me about this , please .
where did you learn how to do this ?
what is happening here ?
that 's ... that 's just lad@@ s on holiday , inn@@ it ?
you know , things get a bit out of control .
hello ?
who 's there ?
hello ?
who are you ?
where are my friends ?
you all ok ?
they ... sha@@ ved me . and they b@@ ust my new glasses .
where are we ?
said mor@@ oc@@ co , didn 't they ?
yeah , i know that . but where ?
did they show you the pictures ?
what pictures ?
what do you say to ' em rick ? nothing .
obviously . don 't tell them anything , all right .
not until we get some kind of legal representation . someone from the em@@ bas@@ sy - am@@ nest@@ y or someone . how you gon@@ na get in touch with them ?
who are they anyway ?
they 're some kind of milit@@ ia or something , aren 't they ?
they knew we had that money . they picked us off . they 're probably using the money for some extre@@ m@@ ist movement .
he was wearing a shirt , with a marks and spencer 's label on . i saw it st@@ icking out .
who ? my inter@@ rog@@ ator . i mean , extre@@ mist@@ s ...
they might .
shall we go and help him ?
best not to get involved .
you all right , mate ?
it 's a woman . serious . it 's a bird !
ar@@ gh ! i was just trying to see if you were ok . i 'm quinn .
what sort of fa@@ g name is that ?
dun@@ no . ask my dad . named after my grand@@ father , i think .
i 'm mercedes . hi .
- your dad into cars then ?
- heard of the count of monte cristo , dum@@ b fuck ?
yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , i dun@@ no , i can 't remember .
can i just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
it 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want . who are they ?
a bunch of cock@@ su@@ ck@@ ers ! come on ! do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the british government ?
yeah , it 's easy . they 're in there . eh ?
what ?
it 's the foreign office . sorry . what is this place exactly ?
it 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
a week ago , i was standing in line , holding a tuna bag@@ u@@ ette , que@@ u@@ ing up for eas@@ y@@ jet . now i 'm being fucking ren@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed !
" dear god , please help me see danger coming my way , " and forgive the body count i will be sending your way . "
" never pick up a dead man 's gun . " " i ... .. " heart ...
right . we should go en masse and dem@@ and to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here . there 's la@@ ws and proto@@ col@@ s ...
you think they 'll care about that ? they still have to ab@@ ide by them .
wo@@ ody , this is our government . govern@@ ments can 't just hold us inde@@ fin@@ it@@ ely for no reason . what you on about ?
course they can ! they do it all the time . you remember those plane spot@@ ters in gre@@ ece ?
they said they were sp@@ ies . and what about gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo ?
nobody even knew who was in there . get off ! come on !
all right ?
how did you end up here then , love ?
i was in kabul , " love . "
you in the army then ?
no , i went there because i like the opera .
didn 't like what i saw , so i went a@@ wo@@ l . took a long fucking walk . post@@ ed some things on the web .
secrets ? there are no secrets . only hidden tru@@ ths .
how long do they usually keep people in here for ? as long as they want . that 's the point .
fel@@ las , can i ... have a word ? in private .
this could be a trick . she could be working for them .
you not seen her face ?
what , you not talking to me now ?
i ain 't the enemy . anyway , if i wanted in@@ fo out of you , i 'd just .... .. beat it out of you .
ever had a ca@@ ulif@@ lower ear , quinn ? or a wet willy ?
you know what churchill said ?
fuck off !
" if you 're going through hell , keep going . "
tou@@ gh it out , guys ! you can get through this . you got each other for a start .
put our time to good use . only trying to help , kno@@ b@@ head . well , you 're not .
so , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , quinn ?
i don 't think anything , ba@@ x . because i 'm stuck in an il@@ legal prison in the middle of the sahara fucking desert . and why am i here ?
because you persu@@ aded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh . " i persu@@ aded you ? you called me .
i 've never called you , ba@@ x@@ ter . i 've never called you because i can@@ not bear your inc@@ es@@ sant mo@@ aning and compl@@ aining . oh , right , great - thanks .
y@@ up . here we go . here we go .
nice tou@@ gh@@ ing it out guys .
oi , quin@@ n@@ bo , you know there 's no " i " in team , don 't you ? no . but there 's a " u " in " fuck you . "
what 's going on ?
stop it ! get off ! get off me !
help ! get off ! what 's happening ?
please , don 't . let go ! where are you taking him ?
leave him alone ! ba@@ x ! get your hands off him , you s@@ lag@@ s !
i watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out . yeah , me too .
shit , no ... come on . let 's not think the worst .
hi@@ ya . i think there 's more gru@@ b on the side . just help yourself .
we 've been worried sick . you 've been gone all night . what happened ?
i dun@@ no ... weird . they asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and to@@ ast .
you should get some . come , please . oi !
sit .
fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
all we wanted to know was who you were finan@@ cing . we weren 't finan@@ cing anyone .
we were just trying to get home . with five million euros ?
we have at our dis@@ pos@@ al dna dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es , for@@ en@@ sic analy@@ sis , satellite imag@@ ing technology . if that doesn 't give us what we need , we emplo@@ y en@@ han@@ ced inter@@ rog@@ ation techniques .
if we want to find out the truth , we do . and now , we have .
we made a mistake . it happens . so ...
just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
hang on . does that mean that we can ... ? please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?
little cand@@ le-@@ lit vi@@ gil ?
col@@ ou@@ red rub@@ ber wrist bands - " free mercedes . "
take care .
mrs peters . 101 bridge road , craw@@ ley . it 's my mum . just let her know i 'm all right .
you take care of yourself .
seriously ?
did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
two nights in . nah ... thought that was it .
what went through your mind ?
well , first of all , my kids ... carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ... i thought i 'd never get to see united play again .
i kept thinking of my kids . kept seeing their little faces . then i thought about nina ....
i wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what i 'm like . be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your por@@ no collection . nah , i don 't know .
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to sp@@ ain and actually ending up in mor@@ oc@@ co .
if anyone so much as men@@ tions " bad luck , " they 're walking . be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour . haven 't seen so much as a cam@@ el .
he 's gone .
he 's not coming back , is he ?
two stay , two go and get help . shouldn 't we all go ? why ?
or stay ? we 'll double our chances if we split . hal@@ ve them you mean .
i do . i do . i do .
i 'll go . come on . you two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
do you believe in destiny , ba@@ x ? no .
so shut up .
fate then ?
rick , please . no destiny , no fate , no karma , no sp@@ ells , no cur@@ ses .
this is just a series of mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings , ok ?
could have happened to any@@ body . no more , no less .
who 's ... ?
come on !
get in . you are about to be shot , get in !
ba@@ x , get in .
woods ! quinn ! hey !
- we had some distur@@ bing intel . - well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
i 'd like to know what 's going on , please . a co@@ vert department of the cia , the special activit@@ ies division has activ@@ ated a kill contr@@ act on you . sorry ?
what are you talking about ? evi@@ d@@ ently , you 've inter@@ sec@@ ted a line of nar@@ co-@@ finance and ... wait .
your man in major@@ ca ... .. has oper@@ ated succes@@ s@@ fully for so long because he gives huge kick@@ backs to the american security services . what ?
he 's pay@@ ing the cia to protect him ?
nar@@ co-@@ finance is a major reven@@ ue stream - for american black ops . - like a f@@ iv@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old , please .
not really new news . why would they want to kill us ?
one of you ti@@ pped off the author@@ ities in the uk . a contact inside custom@@ s and exc@@ ise .
your man here ret@@ ali@@ ated by telling the special activit@@ ies division you were about to blow their op wide open . so now they have to take you out . no , this ... this is crazy .
this goes higher than us . this kind of thing br@@ ings down govern@@ ments . iran contra anyone ?
which is why re@@ moving you is an easy piece of damage limit@@ ation . they can 't just shoot four blo@@ kes who just happened to go on holiday together . under the a@@ eg@@ is of " the global war on terror , " they can shoot anyone they like .
the cia ? no .
they 'd have t@@ asked local contr@@ ac@@ tors . so nothing can be lin@@ ked back to them . you got lucky ...
but this isn 't going to go away . ok , let 's get practic@@ al , then . so what are the op@@ tions ?
well , there must be something ?
right ... right - there may be a solution but we have to act now . like , this minute .
then i 'm afraid you 're on your own . how long would this be for ?
maybe for ever .
- we can never go home ?
- it 's the only offer on the table .
no , no , no , that 's ... that 's not an option .
no . i 'm going home and ... if you go back , you 'll be putting your famili@@ es at risk as well .
ok , let me just see if this is even logist@@ ically possible .
stand up . get up .
we can do it . we have a scramb@@ led phone link . you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circum@@ stances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
amy ... yeah , i know , i 'm sorry that i haven 't rung .
listen to me for a second , love . nina ... just stop , just let me talk , darling , ok ?
right ... there 's no easy way of saying this , ok , so i 'm just going to say it straight out . i 'm not coming back .
if i 've only got one call , which one do i call ? you can 't make me choose . i need you to phone my fol@@ ks ,
where are they ?
shit ... i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much ... i don 't know how long .
.. because that is not what 's happened . i 've met someone .
oh , amy ... please , just tell the kids , ok , that it 's not because of them , i 'm sorry nina .
no , no , everything 's fine . it 's just ... i think i 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
what ?
well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
i can 't hear you rachel , say that again .
take care ?
yeah , ok . i will . you too .
fuck ... no , no , you 're right , i 'm sorry , i know i shouldn 't swear . dad , listen to me , ok ?
you 've been brilli@@ ant , dad .
yeah , just take care . yeah ... i love you , dad .
i know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ? you think it 's my fault because i phon@@ ed the vat man .
it 's nobody 's fault , rick . it 's just ... i don 't know , the universe conspir@@ ing against us or something .
a fly saved my life . what ?
out in the desert . if it hadn 't been for that fly , i 'd have had my head blo@@ wn off . and the weird thing was , we 'd met before .
any idea where we 're going yet ?
is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
ba@@ x ?
what you going to call yourself ?
what do you mean ?
your name .
we can 't use our own names right ?
hey ... i 'm gon@@ na be floyd . that 's what i 'm gon@@ na call myself .
you can 't call yourself that . why ?
it 's a black name . is it ?
it 's like calling yourself ... everton or ty@@ rell , or something . you can 't .
tony smith . my name 's tony ... smith .
why can 't i be tony smith ? you call yourself whatever you like , mate . sir tony smith if you want , mate .
if i was a girl , i 'd call myself ... .. well , hope . you could be bob hope . new hope .
new house .
jamie .... jamie kirk , then . blake ...
tony smith , adam new@@ house , jamie kirk and ... .. blake hat@@ ch . hat@@ ch . welcome to your new fucking lives .
where are we ?
south africa .
we 're on the other side of the world . do they speak english here ?
uh ... i think so . what 's it like ?
i don 't know . this will all sort out , won 't it ?
eh ? a week from now , we 'll be in a pu@@ b in london , we 'll be laughing about this . some rand to get you through the first few weeks .
how do we get in touch with you ?
you don 't . right , ok . - how do we keep in touch ?
- you won 't be able to . it 's too dangerous . hang on a minute .
what happens if it 's safe for us , if it be@@ comes safe for us to go home , to break cover ? how will we know that ?
as far as anyone else knows now , you don 't ex@@ ist . that 's your best chance of survi@@ ving . if you want to stay alive , stay invisible .
the truth will come out though , won 't it ? in the end . ok , let 's go .
say your good@@ b@@ yes . come on , move this thing along . come on , people .
take care of your@@ selves .
wo@@ ody .

right , boys ... chin up . at least we 're still standing , eh ?
you 'll be all right , ba@@ x . what makes you say that ?
you 're smart . i 'm not that fucking smart .
good luck .
hey . what about if just me and him , we stick together ?
- it 'll be all right , won 't it ? - no . - listen , nobody has to know .
you 'll be all right . i can 't do this wo@@ ody . yes , you can .
you 're strong , mate . you 're stronger than you think . no , i 'm not .

a fucking tiger !
i couldn 't believe it .
it was like something a seven year old would tell me ...
" oh , i saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- what are you doing ?
- wondering what would do that to a tiger .
oh , hell .
it 's on fire ...
and it 's green ...
- what 's on fire ?
- the sky .
you know , there 's something about carolina .
i feel like i recognize her .
- fire in the woods , man .
- ( man ) got to get some water .
i told you this was a mistake !
that 's all we had , man .
that 's all we had .
does anyone recognize this ?
we found johnny 's shirt .
and it was full of food from the shed .
( johnny ) i get what it looks like .
i see that .
but i didn 't ste@@ al the food , and i didn 't burn down the shed .
someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
people weren 't taking too kin@@ dly me being at camp ' cause apparently i st@@ ole food from the shed and then burned it down .
someone fr@@ amed me .
they wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
i don 't know who did it .
you know , frank@@ ly , i don 't really care anymore , you know ?
i don 't really need them any@@ ways .
you know , obviously , i can take care of myself .
took them how long to build a fire ?
i did it in five minutes in the dark .
( daniel ) i can 't believe
johnny 's gon@@ na just stay out in the woods .
that 's crazy .
and why shouldn 't he ?
after all the crap that he 's pulled ?
he 'll be fine .
and if he 's not , you got a better chance of win@@ ning .
and you can keep his bed .
i want to make it to the end , but i want to do it as a team , kind of like how ne@@ eko 's doing it , you know ?
can i tell you something ?
( daniel ) sure .
you 're a smart guy .
you know that ne@@ eko is a professional athle@@ te ?
he pl@@ ays game for living .
how about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trust@@ s him , just to win the game ?
have you ever thought about it ?
i don 't think you should trust him .
( sam ) can 't trust any@@ body .
guys ?
i get up early , and as soon as i open the door , i practically ran into this spe@@ ar that 's stuck in the ground .
it felt like a threat .
let me see .
( woman ) what does it say ?
it says ... ( spe@@ aks rus@@ sian )
( woman ) what is that ?
it means " get out . "
it 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
it 's a nice pro@@ p .
look at it .
it 's not real .
nice scar@@ e t@@ acti@@ c .
they 're watching .
i 'm sure they 're loving this .
( woman ) why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
who wants you guys to get out ?
( man ) well , this is here on purpose .
that 's for sure .
it 's here on purpose .
it 's here for a reason .
you guys gon@@ na be so gul@@ li@@ ble to fall for this , really ?
( daniel ) who else could 've left that spe@@ ar ?
besides production , who could 've done it ?
we 're the only people out here .
aren 't we ?
♪
- are you okay ?
- i 'm fine .
i mean , aren 't you still scared ?
the spe@@ ar this morning telling us to leave ?
that doesn 't scar@@ e you at all ?
i think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
i miss home .
i miss my family .
i even miss my stupid ex-@@ boyfriend .
this place is@@ -- it 's getting to me .
i don 't know .
i 'm thinking about pushing the button .
i don 't want you to go .
you know what i mean ?
i thin@@ k@@ -- i think we can win this .
we just need to@@ --
but i don 't need to stay .
i don 't understand why i 'm even staying .
i don 't need the money that badly .
i do .
annie .
( sam ) i 've been a l@@ one wolf for a while , you know ?
i 've been on my own for a while .
i 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than i have been in a long time because i 'm inter@@ acting with people more often than i have in many years .
now i consider daniel a friend .
he 's a good kid .
if i had a son , i 'd be proud if he was like daniel .
what are you looking at ?
- just watching those two .
- m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
( daniel ) i don 't want to over@@ step my bo@@ unds , you know .
i don 't know how she feels about me , and so i 'm just kind of@@ --
i 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard ' cause i really want to , you know , see where this is gon@@ na go .
i don 't know .
at the same time , i don 't want to get hurt .
don 't worry .
she knows you ex@@ ist .
how would i really get her to ?
i don 't know , like ...
get her to what ?
like me like me .
you can 't get her to like you .
either she does or she doesn 't .
you know ?
( laugh@@ s )
how beautiful is it ?
this is so nice .
_
why not ?
_
( laugh@@ s )
i 'm sorry .
i 'm being nau@@ gh@@ ty .
it 's beautiful in , though .
_
you must be hot .
come on .
_
- no good ... _
- no one 's here .
- it 's trouble .
no one 's here .
i 'm not gon@@ na tell anyone .
you want to come .
- oh , yeah ?
_
you 'll thank me once you 're in here .
it 's beautiful .
_
careful .
_
i 'm gon@@ na film us .
_
( laugh@@ s ) it 's a great idea .
( laugh@@ s )
you promise you 'll er@@ ase it ?
_
- promise me ?
- i promise .
good .
annie ?
wait , annie .
you shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
it 's not safe .
_
what are you talking about ?
come on , it 's not safe .
stop . wait .
don 't be like this .
be like what ?
look , i-@@ - ( sig@@ hs )
it 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
i 'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-@@ boyfriend , and i get that you 're sad about that .
but you 're for@@ getting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
no , i 'm not .
( annie ) i like her .
it 's been a while since i 've been with any@@ body , but i-@@ -
we get along so well .
i just feel like a dum@@ bass now .
i mean , she 's probably not gon@@ na talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- hey .
- ( irene ) hey .
- there you are .
- ( irene ) how 's it going ?
good .
i just wanted to talk to you .
u@@ h-@@ huh ?
um , so , victoria 's gone .
um , i 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
oh , it '@@ s-@@ - well , it 's free right now .
so no one would mind if i moved in ?
um ... yeah , yeah .
i mean , i don 't mind .
i don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
( est@@ her ) aw@@ esome .
all right , i 'll go grab my things .
it 's not that i didn 't have fun with the boys .
i don 't know .
i just feel like my time there is done .
it 's served its purpose , and i want to@@ --
i want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- ( mil@@ jan ) hey .
- hey .
- ( mil@@ jan ) what are you doing ?
- i 'm leaving .
you mean the show ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s ) no , you idiot .
i 'm gon@@ na move into victoria 's old bed .
wait .
why ?
why ?
because it 's free .
( mil@@ jan ) i know , but i thought you liked it here with me .
you said we are great ro@@ om@@ mates .
yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
just , i don 't know .
i want to be with the girls now .
come on , est@@ her .
don 't you think we should team up ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s )
we are both smar@@ ter than everyone else here .
we can win this th@@ ing@@ -- together .
oh@@ h , i like your style .
i will think about it .
but hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
i was just thinking that we could have something ... ( est@@ her ) you thought what ?
that we could get rom@@ antic a little bit ?
( est@@ her ) ( laugh@@ s )
( mil@@ jan ) don 't laugh .
really ?
i don 't do romance .
look , we 're playing a game .
( mil@@ jan ) what do you mean ?
( est@@ her ) i 'm playing a gam@@ e-@@ - for money .
i don 't do romance , and i 'm not playing a dating game .
i 'm sorry .
fuck you , bitch !
fuck you , bitch !
you 're not going anywhere .
get the fuck off me !
( mil@@ jan ) i 'm kid@@ ding .
( laughing ) i was just kid@@ ding , est@@ her .
i 'm just kid@@ ding .
est@@ her .
( est@@ her ) don 't you fucking touch me again .
( mil@@ jan ) come on ! i 'm just@@ -
- i was just kid@@ ding !
( est@@ her ) i think i was in shock .
i-@@ i don 't know .
it happened so quickly .
but he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bun@@ k , and then he backed off .
( mil@@ jan ) est@@ her is a player .
we all know that .
and i played with her , too .
so she was on the way out .
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jo@@ king@@ ly , like preten@@ ding that i 'm like scar@@ ing her .
" you 're gon@@ na stay here , " or something .
she just , like , fre@@ aked out .
she pushed me away .
she 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
stor@@ med out , like mad .
and i was just telling her , " i 'm jo@@ king .
you know me . i always joke around .
i was just jo@@ king with you . "
i didn 't get it , seriously .
she just fre@@ aked out , and it was just a pure joke .
what are you showing me ?
it was right here .
( carolina ) are you sure ?
( ne@@ eko ) big huge car@@ cas@@ s .
gut@@ s hanging out and everything .
look .
look at what ?
the blood ?
it could 've been anything .
it could 've been a bird . it could 've been a de@@ er .
( ne@@ eko ) why would i make this up ?
why would i lie ?
there was a hu@@ ge@@ -- there was a huge tiger there .
i guess they took it .
the produ@@ cer@@ s took it .
the produ@@ cer@@ s ?
i think she thinks that i could 've been trying to scar@@ e her , play a sick joke on her .
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person .
for all i know , johnny took it .
( carolina ) johnny took it ?
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
i don 't know .
( carolina ) oh , now johnny does everything ?
not only do we have to worry about the produ@@ cer@@ s playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
hope@@ fully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here .
i don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
why are you always defen@@ ding him ?
why are you always defen@@ ding him ?
i 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
you need to watch yourself !
i 'm kind of b@@ aff@@ led where it 's gone , you know , ' cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
it would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hef@@ ty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
it 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
got some trap@@ s set up along this way somewhere .
i found some de@@ er tra@@ ils i s@@ cou@@ ted earlier .
hope they catch something .
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty aw@@ esome , actually .
had a nice little fire .
weather was nice .
you know , wrapped up .
it was nice being on my own .
it 's what i wanted to do origin@@ ally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and i got that , so pretty content .
what the hell did this , man ?
this thing 's ...
i mean , it , obviously , it ripped the de@@ er while it was standing here .
it was strong enough to rip it off@@ -- rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
( crack )
what do you want ?
what are you doing ?
( johnny ) i 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
what do you want ?
i just came to try to convince you to come back .
( johnny ) try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
yeah , i don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
i think it 's saf@@ er here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accus@@ ations .
just , whatever happened , i don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here .
well , you know what ?
i really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
i 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
i can take care of myself .
y '@@ all try taking care of your@@ selves , too , all right ?
( carolina ) okay , fine .
if that 's how you want to be , then fine .
( johnny ) fine .
nah , that '@@ s-@@ - that 's not good enough .
that ain 't good enough .
( daniel ) hey , irene .
hey , dan .
what@@ cha doing ?
collec@@ ting some acor@@ ns .
- oh .
- yeah .
if you mas@@ h them up , you can make like a pa@@ ste and make a pan@@ cake out of it .
- really ?
- yeah .
is it@@ -- does it taste good ?
i think so .
you want me to help ?
oh , sure .
that 'd be great . yeah .
they 're kind of scat@@ tered all over .
daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gent@@ le-@@ - a very gentle spirit ,
i guess you can say .
hey .
it 's a si@@ ber@@ ian squ@@ ill .
( irene ) i 'm not really big on flowers .
why not ?
well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower ' cause it 's like , " oh , you know , i like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
it never really made sense to me .
( chuck@@ les )
something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
( daniel ) she 's got so much comple@@ x@@ ity to her , you know ?
i find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that i would 've never expected out of her .
it 's ... ( chuck@@ les )
she 's just@@ -- she 's amazing .
( both chuck@@ le )
where are we ?
i can 't find the path .
we 're lost .
- we 're not lost .
- no , we 're lost .
i don 't know where we 're going .
( mil@@ jan ) in the middle of the wood , very close to the river ,
i found this really we@@ ir@@ d-@@ looking tree .
i mean , it wasn 't a tree .
it was something different .
it had a face shape .
it had hair .
what ?
my name is mil@@ jan .
it 's really nice to meet you . ( chuck@@ les )
what is your name ?
og@@ dee ?
( laugh@@ s )
this is my friend og@@ dee .
we go way back , man .
( laugh@@ s )
he 's so bad .
i spoke to it .
we had a little conversation .
og@@ dee is my old friend from high school .
( laugh@@ s )
i 'm kid@@ ding .
- ( man ) est@@ her .
est@@ her .
- what ?
( est@@ her ) hey .
where have you been ?
out .
out ?
where do you go all day , anyway ?
( whisper@@ ing ) okay .
i can 't believe you got us so lost .
we 're not lost .
yes , we are .
where are we ?
do you know where we are ?
we 're in siberia .
not funny .
oh , god !
what is that ?
did you hear that ?
i heard it .
come on .
there might be something out here .
come on .
oh !
oh , god !
what are you doing out here ?
sorry .
i 'm going to get water .
where are you going ?
hom@@ e-@@ - where the hell is it ?
that way .
why is she being such a bitch ?
why are you here , by the way , alone ?
no reason .
u@@ h-@@ huh .
that 's susp@@ icious .
( annie ) shut up , mil@@ jan .
( chuck@@ les )
( ne@@ eko ) guys , have you seen carolina ?
( sam ) no .
she hasn 't come back .
you mean she 's not back yet ?
she 's not back .
i have no idea where she is .
i haven 't seen her .
you do know she 's out there with johnny ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i know .
well , i don 't know about you , but i feel like i should go and look for her .
i don '@@ t-@@ - i don 't feel comfortable with her with johnny .
( sam ) before it gets too late , i think we should .
i 'm game , yeah .
( ne@@ eko ) - you 're gon@@ na come with me ?
- yeah .
( mil@@ jan ) gentlem@@ en .
where the hell were you ?
i was in the woods .
have you seen carolina ?
( ne@@ eko ) she 's out there with johnny .
( mil@@ jan ) oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- come on .
- are you serious ?
( mil@@ jan ) yes .
they 're probably having sex or something .
oh , you 're a funny guy .
don 't be nai@@ ve . you didn 't notice the chem@@ ist@@ ry they had ?
( ne@@ eko ) hey , guys , listen .
i 'm gon@@ na look for her .
i don 't know about you .
just sitting here talking .
( mil@@ jan ) hey , it 's dark outside .
( rum@@ bling )
oh , fuck !
( ne@@ eko ) get on the bed .
get onto the bed !
the bed ?
( mil@@ jan ) oh , my god .
what is this ?
the cab started shaking ...
ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that i 've never seen in my life , and i 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
what is it ?
it 's lik@@ e-@@ - it 's like the sky 's on fire .
what ?
it 's like the sky 's on fire .
( daniel ) the sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like victoria said .
if this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
i don 't understand how they could pull it off .
( sam ) i feel like i 'm on another planet .
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and no@@ body@@ -- nobody has any answers .
i don 't have an answer .
i could sit here all day long and just@@ -- it 's way above my pay scale .
- is it moving ?
- it just ke@@ eps moving .
carolina never came back today , did she ?
( woman ) yeah .
wh@@ ere@@ -- where are they ?
( mil@@ jan ) she 's still in the wood@@ s-@@ - the forest .
well , this can 't stop us .
we still have to find her .
we can 't leave her out there .
we better go now .
we 're just gon@@ na go look for her@@ -- me and sam , daniel , mil@@ jan as well .
oh , my god .
carolina ?
carolina .
are you okay ?
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting )
( woman ) what happened ?
oh , my god .
carolina !
- what happened ?
are you okay ?
- are you okay ?
then we see carolina stum@@ bling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rus@@ hing over to her .
are you hurt somewhere ?
- ( sam ) what happened ?
- ( woman ) look at all the blood .
what happened ?
she 's ble@@ eding .
guys , don 't , don '@@ t-@@ - don 't go to her .
oh , my god , look at her arm .
look at her arm .
( sam ) what happened to you ?
you 're okay .
( ne@@ eko ) carolina , what happened ?
( daniel ) carolina shows up , and she 's bat@@ tered and dis@@ orient@@ ed .
she couldn 't even speak .
she 's trembling .
( carolina ) i don 't ...
she doesn 't remember .
- ( woman ) you don 't remember ? - ( carolina cri@@ es )
( sam ) what do you remember ?
( natalie ) she didn 't know what was going on .
she was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
she was just talking non@@ sense , and it was really jol@@ ting to see her come back like that .
_
( woman ) you were with john ?
- ( sam ) and what happened ?
- ( woman ) where is he ?
what were you doing with johnny ?
get her some water .
get her some help .
( ne@@ eko ) carolina , were you with johnny ?
( sam ) she said she was .
what were you doing with johnny ?
( ne@@ eko ) she said the name " johnny . "
at that point , i just , you know , lost it .
listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
( ne@@ eko ) for what ?
here , just come here .
come here .
i want to say something to you .
- what ?
- listen to me !
it 's important .
you got to make sure .
you look at his hands .
( ne@@ eko ) okay .
his hands are a t@@ ell@@ -@@ tale sign , okay ?
his hands will tell you if he did something .
( daniel ) what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
stay here with the girls .
stay here with the girls !
( ne@@ eko ) i 'm not wast@@ ing any more time with this guy .
everyone wants to keep him around , thinking ,
" oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
no , i don 't think so .
i 'm not gon@@ na lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- she 's been through a lot .
- yeah .
we 're gon@@ na look after you , okay ?
don 't worry .
( est@@ her ) we don 't know where johnny is .
carolina sort of@@ -- she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was@@ -- they were fig@@ ht@@ ing@@ -- her and johnny were fighting .
and then , now she looks like this , so johnny should be probably fe@@ aring for his life right now because sam and ne@@ eko went after him .
let 's just keep moving .
( rust@@ ling )
move .
move .
_
( rust@@ ling contin@@ ues )
the whole walking through the woods and hearing no@@ ises coming from places that , you know@@ --
we stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
it 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
i haven 't slept very well , you know .
so i 'm just@@ -- you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
you always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
i don 't know .
( animal scre@@ ech@@ es )
well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
( rust@@ ling )
yes .
you keep saying " he , " " he . "
look how thick the brush is here .
if there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
we hear other things .
all of a sudden , something goes flying .
i think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
i 'll go see if the water 's bo@@ iled .
thank you .
( natalie ) i don 't want to die .
i didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibil@@ ity on this show , and every day that i 'm here ,
i feel like i 'm an idiot for staying , that i am gon@@ na end up like tommy .
( cri@@ es )
i don 't deal well with@@ -- ab@@ use is not something that ...
i can handle right now .
i 'm scared .
( daniel ) and johnny was already on the ou@@ ts with the group for ste@@ aling food .
i just@@ -- how could he do that to her ?
it didn 't make sense .
she 's such a nice lady .
( foot@@ steps )
johnny .
hey .
what did you do ?
- huh ?
- what did you do to carolina ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
what do you mean you don 't know what i 'm talking about ?
- what 'd you do to her ?
- i didn '@@ t-@@ -
she 's all cut up and shit .
i don '@@ t-
- i don 't know .
i ...
what 's wrong with you ?
i don 't know . i just@@ -
- i kind of came to .
i was walking around , and ...
i don 't know .
i was@@ - - i saw her .
you saw her where ?
you got to tell me what happened .
we were in the woods , and ...
i don 't real@@ ly@@ -- i don 't really remember .
i get approached by daniel , and bas@@ ically started accus@@ ing me of hur@@ ting carolina .
i didn 't know what to say .
( natalie ) what did you to do her ? !
the last thing she remem@@ bers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
i don 't .
( natalie ) then what happened to her ?
i don 't know .
that 's not a very good answer right now , man .
i don '@@ t-@@ - trust me .
that 's not a very good answer .
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting in distance )
hey .
you hear that ?
at the camp .
let 's go .
i don 't know .
are you serious ?
you don 't know ?
you 're such a s@@ cum@@ bag .
oh , what ?
so she just fell down and ended up that way ?
are you kid@@ ding me ?
i was in a complete ha@@ ze .
i had no re@@ collection .
i was like black@@ ed out , like i dr@@ ank too much .
( daniel ) he doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on .
( johnny ) i don 't .
- then what happened to her ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
i don 't know .
( woman ) you were together , weren 't you ?
- you said that .
- shit !
ne@@ eko !
ne@@ eko !
( indi@@ st@@ inc@@ t shou@@ ting )
( daniel ) guys , he doesn 't know !
( ne@@ eko )
- mother@@ fu@@ cker !
( daniel )
- come on !
stop it !
- ( carolina ) stop !
stop it !
- ( ne@@ eko ) come on !
stop it !
ne@@ eko , stop it !
he didn 't do it !
carolina starts screaming , " it 's not him .
he didn 't do it . "
stop it !
what do you mean ?
you said you don 't remember .
you said you don 't remember .
( ne@@ eko ) you 're a dead man .
you 're a fucking dead man .
( daniel ) listen .
listen .
hey , hey .
hey !
calm down .
listen .
- what happened ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
talk to me .
i don 't know .
johnny doesn 't know anything ?
he doesn 't remember anything .
it was just her and him in the forest .
i know that .
i know that .
i saw it in his eyes , okay ?
all i remember is i talked to her .
we were argu@@ ing .
and then i-@@ i came here , and i started getting acc@@ used , and i don 't even know what the fuck is going on .
( sam ) if we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
when i saw that look in his eyes ,
i just felt that i needed to take a step back .
remember the way she came into camp ?
he 's got the same look on his face .
( johnny ) does she remember anything ?
( woman ) show us your hands .
( woman ) ( gas@@ ps )
( natalie ) oh , yeah .
i 've seen that before .
( woman ) what 's that from ?
( sam ) nothing 's making sense here .
and just to be angry and become a bunch of anim@@ al@@ s-@@ -
we can 't go killing each other .
we 're still human be@@ ings .
( his@@ s )
( talking indi@@ st@@ inc@@ tly )
( birds chir@@ ping )
i don 't like things that i can 't explain and that i don 't have at least some sort of control over .
the sky changing color and looking like fi@@ re-@@ - the produ@@ cer@@ s , the show can 't do that .
we 're talking super@@ natural stuff now .
reg@@ ard@@ less of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
( johnny ) it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her .
i 've never hit a woman in my life .
i don 't know why i would .
i don 't remember anything , but ...
i can 't say that i didn 't ' cause i don '@@ t-@@ -
i don 't know what happened .
but i know in my heart i wouldn 't do that .
( carolina ) i don 't remember anything .
all i remember is that i was ... with@@ --
went to get johnny .
he was in the woods .
i found him , and i ...
it 's all one big bl@@ ur , like one big black@@ out .
i have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and i don 't remember .
i don 't understand .
so you 're telling me this is real .
( sab@@ ina ) yes .
it looks like it 's nat@@ ive , hand@@ made .
it looks like it 's just a pro@@ p to me .
well , if it 's a pro@@ p , it 's really well-@@ made ' cause you see the bar@@ bs .
they 're cur@@ ved .
that 's exactly how it should look .
this is o@@ x .
it 's real o@@ x .
and it 's balan@@ ced for throwing .
it just looks perfect .
it 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
i don 't have to deal with lies in figur@@ ing out what is true , what is not .
i have to know the environ@@ ment i 'm in .
i have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
look at this .
so , i found this symbol that is really strange .
it has four lines and little triang@@ les on the ends .
then i found another one and another one , and i realized it 's a path .
i should follow them .
at the end , it was very close to the sett@@ lement .
i found the last one .
and i found this box .
it was a metal box .
i opened it , and it was a book .
i didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
i would assume it 's rus@@ sian because it 's cyril@@ li@@ c letters .
( mil@@ jan ) in the middle of me looking at it , somebody was watching at me .
it was a person .
he 's staring at me .
and he just disappeared in a second .
so there are people out there .
hey .
i was just gon@@ na try and make things better , and , like , apologi@@ ze , and just wanted to let her know that i didn 't , you know ,
i didn 't want to scre@@ w anything up or make anything awkward for her .
i guess i was in a weird mood , and i just want to apologi@@ ze because i don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because i 'm really glad you '@@ re-@@ -
( natalie ) when i realized what annie 's real feelings were for me ,
i just thought ...
" i 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
so i kissed her .
( chuck@@ les )
which i kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
( laugh@@ s )
don 't worry about it .
hey .
hey .
can i have a seat ?
how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
you ?
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing ' cause i knew she had scrat@@ ches and stuff on her , and she was sure fre@@ aked out like i was .
( carolina ) do you remember anything from last night ?
no .
i don 't remember a thing .
i don 't remember anything either .
but i know you didn 't hurt me .
i would never hurt you .

( johnny ) can i ask you something , though ?
why 'd you set me up ?
with the shed and the food ?
she couldn 't even look me in the eye .
and i was like , " well ... "
i was like , " it tells me all i need to know , "
so i was lik@@ e-@@ - got the hell out of there .

i didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't want@@ -
- i asked them .
you didn 't want to do what ?
i didn 't want to burn it down .
i didn 't want to set you up .
they told me to .
who 's they ?
the produ@@ cer@@ s .
so you '@@ re-@@ - you 're helping the show ?
- mom , may i please go to the to@@ il@@ et ?
david !
it 's me .
olivier ! what are you doing here ?
you thought you were going to america without me ?
you 're coming with us ?
wow ! i 'm so happy !
- but how can we do it ?
- don 't worry , i planned everything .
i have my health card .
i even pin@@ ched some money from jean and elo@@ die ... for the train .
see , i still have some left .
you can 't pay the boat fare with that .
i 'll try to get hi@@ red as a cabin boy , or a dis@@ h@@ was@@ her .
or hide with you as a sto@@ wa@@ way .
i saw that in a movie .
i 'll feed you .
in america , samuel will help me cross the bor@@ der .
now that you 're an or@@ phan , my parents could adop@@ t you .
oh yeah !
that would be s@@ well .
we 'd be brothers !
come on .
let 's go see my parents .
wouldn 't it be better to meet on the boat ?
but no . they 'll be really happy to see you .
they were aw@@ fully worried .
isaac !
olivier !
what are you doing here ?
is elo@@ die with you ?
no . she doesn 't know i 'm coming with you .
coming with us ?
now what is this all about ?
we could take him to america .
but these children are ut@@ ter@@ ly out of their min@@ ds !
olivier , we would glad@@ ly take you if we could , but we 're not your parents .
we can adop@@ t him !
david , look .
we can 't just adop@@ t someone .
and then , olivier has a family , an aunt who has the means to give him a good education .
i don 't want to go to aunt victoria 's .
she 's a co@@ w ! listen .
once we get to hav@@ re , i 'll call elo@@ die .
i 'll buy a tic@@ ket for your return , and she 'll come ... pick you up at the saint-@@ laz@@ are station .
i can 't !
i pin@@ ched money from her to take the train .
no .
it 's okay .
i will explain ... and she 'll understand .
if he can 't come with us , then i 'm staying with him .
isaac , tell them it 's not possible !
listen , olivier ...
we understand your sor@@ row but please , be reason@@ able .
no . it 's not true .
you understand nothing !
you only think of yourself !
no , olivier .
olivier , wait for me !
i 'm coming with you !
david , come back !
hurry david , hurry up !
children , come back !
ou@@ ch !
my leg !
- i got one . - olivier !
it wasn 't my son who pulled the alarm .
it was a friend who wanted to come with us .
he 's all alone . you must find him !
- come here , david .
- i 'll see what i can do .
i don 't want to go with you .
david !
come back , kid .
what happened ?
a kid pulled the alarm .
he ran away .
you should put a flar@@ e on the track for the next train .
we don 't have time .
olivier !
olivier !
olivier !
david !
david !
david .
- where are you 're going , boy ?
paris ?
that 's pretty far off !
i had planned to take the train .
i 'm going to paris as well . i 'll take you .
besides , i don 't like trav@@ eling alone , so we 'll be doing each other a favor .
agreed ?
anyone in the back ?
no . i 'm going back empty .
- so , okay .
- where in paris do you live ?
i 'm not from paris , i 'm from the hill .
a real ur@@ chin , hey .
your parents just let you go ?
yeah .
my parents are really cool .
they trust me .
okay .
get in .
- so ?
- so .... so ...
zil@@ ch .
nothing .
the police have issu@@ ed an ap@@ b .
z@@ ob@@ er was the last to see him .
since then , not a trace .
and that 's not all !
they want to fine him for pulling the alarm .
and for the money he 's stol@@ en ?
- did you tell them ?
- no .
i 'm waiting for them to find him .
i hope he didn 't do anything stupid .
him ? what do you think !
just wait . he 'll get what 's coming to him .
i want him out of here .
he 's a s@@ ack of shit !
- listen .
- i don 't want to hear it !
i 'll kick his ass straight to the re@@ format@@ ory !
any@@ body here ?
what is it ?
what do you want , l@@ ad ?
i 'd like to talk to mr. pri@@ vat .
he should be here .
no . he 's at home now , in auverg@@ ne .
can i call him ?
my mother often called him from here .
so you are the son of mrs. chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f ?
everyone is looking for you , even the police .
- i beg you .
i must talk to him .
it 's important .
i 'll call .
good evening , miss .
could you ring number 3 at sau@@ gues , please .
it 's in haute-@@ loire .
you won 't tell the cops , eh ?
hello ?
mr. pri@@ vat ?
excuse me . this is hotel du cant@@ al .
i have mrs. chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f 's son here .
he wants to talk to you .
i 'll put him on .
hello .
mr. pri@@ vat ?
yes , this is olivier .
you must help me . i did something stupid .
i ran away and st@@ ole money from elo@@ die .
i 'm really scared .
yes .
yes , okay .
thank you .
i 'll put him on .
hello , mr. pri@@ vat ?
yes .

come with me .
you 'll sleep here .
olivier !
olivier !
hello !
wake up .
- good morning .
- good morning , sir .
this breakfast should give you a bo@@ ost .
thank you .
but first ... i must tell you what happened .
don 't worry .
i know all about it .
everything 's been sor@@ ted out .
i 've already been to the police station and have spoken to elo@@ die .
she 's waiting for you .
- she 's glad you 're in good health .
- she won 't send me to reform school ?
nothing of the sort .
everyone knows what you 're going through right now .
elo@@ die even has a surprise for you .
come on , eat up .
then we 'll go see her .
okay , sir .
this is so good !
i 'm coming !
olivier , i 'm so glad to see you .
you 're okay ?
- you 're not too tired ?
- no , no .
i 'm fine .
i 'm fine .
elo@@ die ... i wanted to apologi@@ ze .
for the money and for the scar@@ e i 've given you .
you know , we all make mist@@ akes .
it wasn 't too serious .
and we understand you .
without your mom , and also with david 's depar@@ ture ...
this is why mister pri@@ vat and we decided to make you a big surprise .
what is it ?
you 'll go with him to sau@@ gues .
you 'll see , there you 'll be very , very happy .
you 'll have a big bedroom all to yourself .
you 'll learn to ride a horse .
and then the mountain air , there 's nothing better for a child !
and i don 't live far from your grand@@ parents .
you can see them when you want .
and there 's also a very good school .
your studies will be better there .
what does aunt victoria say ?
she wouldn 't let me see you !
who does she think she is ?
it 's none of her business .
well , don 't stand there .
sit down , mr. pri@@ vat .
after all , it was your mother 's idea , to go with mr. pri@@ vat .
if you want to , of course .
when 's that gon@@ na be ?
well , today .
you see , i finished pack@@ ing your suit@@ case .
so you can catch the 2 pm train .
you 'll see , you 'll be better off there than here .
- why so fast ?
- aunt victoria could make trouble .
trouble ?
yes . by law i don 't have the right to take you .
i 'll have a law@@ yer if necessary .
i 'll say that it was your mother 's wish and yours as well .
don 't you worry olivier .
you 'd only get miser@@ able here .
there are too many memories .
i wonder if i have time to say goodbye to m@@ ado .
you and your m@@ ado , i tell you !
better hurry , you don 't want to miss the 2 pm train .
get on with it .
olivier !
i 'm so happy to see you .
you gave us such a scar@@ e !
when did you get back ?
this morning .
- well , come in !
- no , no .
i came to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
yes .
i 'm going to auverg@@ ne with a friend of my mother 's .
it may be the best for you .
olivier !
- hurry up !
- yes .
i 'm coming !
i 'll have to go .
by the way ...
i just wanted to tell you that ...
i 'll never forget you .
goodbye , olivier .
- don 't forget to write me !
- yes , m@@ ado .
hey , artiller@@ y@@ man !
hit@@ ting the road without saying goodbye ?
yeah . i 'm going to auverg@@ ne .
give my reg@@ ards to the volcan@@ o@@ es !
- okay .
- right , shall we go ?
where you 're going with that suit@@ case ?
well , i 'm leaving .
- for long ?
- i don 't know .
maybe for good .
don 't forget me too fast , okay ?
come on , oliver .
come .
olivier !
olivier .
i made you some pan@@ cak@@ es .
i know you like them so much .
you can eat them on the train .
you were always so sweet .
don 't change too much over there .
okay , i 'll leave you here because ... far@@ e@@ wells makes me too sad .
olivier , it 's for your own good , you know that don 't you ?
come on , give me a kiss .
now don 't you worry .
i 'll see you soon .
- thank you , mr. pri@@ vat .
- goodbye . let 's go .
i say , you 're a real celebr@@ ity around here .
have you ever been to sau@@ gues , before the funeral ?
no , sir . never .
call me andre .
gare d '@@ or@@ say .
get in .
no . i can 't .
i can 't .
what 's the matter ?
i can 't leave my street .
it 's not because of you , but i want to stay here .
- why did you call me , then ?
i thought ... - i know .
it 's my fault .
but i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave bou@@ gr@@ as , m@@ ado ,
cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re , lo@@ ul@@ ou ...
i don 't even want to leave i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee .
don 't worry , olivier .
i understand completely .
we will do what you want .
anyway , think about it .
if you need me , write me .
well , goodbye .
olivier !
what 's going on ?
where is mr. pri@@ vat ?
well , he took a taxi .
how so ?
without you ?
i didn 't want to leave .
what ? are you crazy ?
everything was arrang@@ ed !
i don 't want to leave my street .
i don 't want to leave my friends .
and you , of course .
you think you 're gon@@ na stay with us ?
we can 't af@@ ford it , you know that !
if that 's the way it 's going to be , i 'll in@@ form aunt victoria .
and the family council will have to decide .
henri , i 'm coun@@ ting on you .
you will be firm .
as usual , my dear .
wow , check out this tin can !
can you believe this ?
it 's sl@@ ick .
- really sn@@ az@@ zy !
- hey , get away from there !
here we are !
- hello , henri .
- hello , jean .
ah , here 's our little advent@@ urer .
- hello , elo@@ die .
- hello .
you 'll be able to br@@ ag about the awful fri@@ ght you gave us .
oh yes !
you can say that again !
- hello .
- hello .
as you know , the haber@@ das@@ her@@ y has been sol@@ d .
i gathered for you some of your mother 's things , olivier .
there are some personal it@@ ems , sou@@ ven@@ irs , photos of your father , - and several school no@@ te@@ books .
- thanks , aunt .
it 's only natural , olivier .
your uncle is now your guardian and will look after the money you will rece@@ ive .
say uncle , what is a guardian ?
it means i am responsible for you .
- as if you were my father ?
- yes , something like that .
come one , sort these out in your room .
what 's a family council ?
well , the family ga@@ thers to de@@ termine what is best for your future .
why can 't i listen to what 's being said ?
because that 's the way it is .
go , please leave us .
take it .
go .
please , let 's sit down and talk .
what do you plan on doing with him ?
us , what do you mean ?
it 's up to you to take him . you 're his aunt .
i 'm only his cousin , and a distant one at that .
come on . i 'm sure we can find a solution together .
one obviously comes to mind .
yes . the or@@ phan@@ age .
that might be a little har@@ sh .
we had something else in mind .
if we wanted to honor virgin@@ ie 's w@@ ishes , it would be up to m. pri@@ vat to take care of him .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again :
- it is out of the question .
he 's an ex-@@ convic@@ t , remember that .
what would the people say in sau@@ gues ?
what would they think of us ?
besides , the kid doesn 't want that .
how would you know ?
i suppose i can tell you , now .
on the day he returned from his fu@@ gue , he called pri@@ vat at his estate .
i thought it was because he wanted to go stay with him .
unfortunately , at the last minute , he decided he wanted to stay with us .
if i understand correc@@ tly , you decided this without our knowing .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
it would have su@@ ited everyone .
i 'm not of that opinion .
but , since you de@@ em@@ ed it un@@ necessary to consul@@ t me , it 's because you don 't recognize my right .
it 's up to you to take care of him .
besides , his world is here .
in our milieu , he would be all confused .
that 's it , victoria .
you 're too good for your brother 's son .
i didn 't say that .
no need to be so offensive .
un@@ question@@ ably , you can 't den@@ y ... that olivier has spent all of his life on this street .
his school and his friends are here .
besides , at this moment , with my son coming down with tubercul@@ osis , have you thought of the risk of con@@ tag@@ ion ?
yes , of course i have .
how are we going to feed him ?
- we 're already strugg@@ ling .
- and this apartment is too small .
i could help you .
tempor@@ arily , of course .
well in that case , maybe we could keep him .
we would need ...
i don 't know ... 150 francs a month .
- what ? half of that would be plenty .
that just wouldn 't be enough .
but we will make an effort until the end of the school year .
after that , we won 't be able to .
you do know that we hope to have a child of our own soon .
elo@@ die , you 've been chant@@ ing that for the last 2 years .
how can you say that , victoria !
- i didn 't mean to off@@ end you .
- that 's too easy ! jean , tell her to get out of here !
now , now , preci@@ ous , victoria has apologi@@ z@@ ed .
impl@@ ying that we 're only good at making bab@@ es with tubercul@@ osis , that takes the cake !
i will not stay here one second longer .
- let 's go , henri .
- no . wait for me in the car .
what a mess !
especially since we agreed to a sett@@ lement .
henri , i would think that with 115 ... okay , let 's say 110 , we could make ends meet . come now , let 's not nego@@ ti@@ ate again .
our proposition stands at 100 .
if that doesn 't work out , we can always discus@@ s it further .
- so let 's start with 100 .
- here is the first month 's .
- goodbye , henri .
- yes , goodbye .
elo@@ die .
elo@@ die , open the door , please .
ah , you !
you could have taken my side at least !
they were ready to give us 100 francs . i wasn 't going to mess with that .
lucky for us , i pat@@ ched things up !
you call that pat@@ ching things up ?
you know it won 't be enough .
i told you , we need at least 130 franc .
if i work for the rest , maybe i can stay ?
you know the answer is yes .
you 're e@@ aves@@ dropping .
but not for long . but why ?
because you 're a pain , that 's why .
all you care about is whether you can stay or not !
look at you .
you 're y@@ elling at the kid , yet in front of victoria , you can 't grow a pair !
you ... looks like you 're cour@@ ting back luck .
i got it , i got it !
" dear david ,
" it 's been 6 weeks to this day since your depar@@ ture .
" i have no news from you , which means you 're probably busy ,
" as well as your parents . "
hey , olivier , you coming ?
we 've made our own wad@@ ing pool .
now , let me give you some ad@@ vice .
come play with us instead of wast@@ ing ink ...
- on a guy who 'll never answer you .
- would you leave me alone , lo@@ ul@@ ou ?
come on , lo@@ ul@@ ou !
i 'm coming !
g@@ laz@@ ier !
g@@ laz@@ ier !
so , artiller@@ y@@ man , you still here ?
why the sad face ?
david is gone .
i have no news of him .
i can 't stay with my cous@@ ins .
i would have to some@@ what ear@@ n my keep .
you could always help me with my cho@@ res , right ?
you 'll see , ear@@ ning your keep isn 't that hard .
and if you ask me , you shouldn 't waste your time like this , staring for hours at your mother 's old bou@@ tique .
that won 't bring her back , you know .
i know it 's not fair .
and with your best friend gone .
you feel abandon@@ ed .
but friends ... you still have quite a few around here .
and you 'll make new ones .
see , look at your bud@@ dies .
you have to open up , olivier .
you understand ?
come on , ol@@ ive !
no bad feelings !
go on , go !
come on , we 're having a sp@@ lash !
hurry up , for god 's sake !
aren 't you done yet wast@@ ing this water ... with your stupid games ?
- bunch of gut@@ ter-@@ pu@@ pp@@ ies !
- we 're doing nothing wrong .
" nothing wrong " ?
what if there 's a fire , where would the water come from ?
come on , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et , have you never been young ? children should have fun .
what right have you , madame ?
i have no les@@ sons to learn from a .... from a hook@@ er .
are you afraid you might get hook@@ ed , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et ?
i think i could te@@ ach you a few things .
let 's stop there .
i have nothing to say to you .
you started it , old far@@ t .
she really na@@ iled you , gast@@ oun@@ et !
you anarch@@ ist , i have nothing to say to you .
and you ? who do you think you are , you old grin@@ ch .
we 're not about to stop the children from having fun !
taking the moral high ground instead of swe@@ eping his own porch .
what a sour@@ pus@@ s !
- how 's the work coming downstairs ?
- very well , very well .
- bou@@ gr@@ as says we 'll be done by 5 .
- good .
that 's very good .
here you go , two che@@ ese sand@@ wich@@ es .
enjoy . thank you very much .
ah ... there 's i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee .
thanks .
good day , sir , you okay ?
no , i 'm not okay .
the salv@@ ation army and sou@@ p kitchen close in the spring .
i 'm hungry . artiller@@ y@@ man !
where are my sand@@ wich@@ es ?
coming , coming !
good lord , a nice shot of red and a che@@ ese sand@@ wich .
the only 2 things worth living for !
hey , hey ... easy there little f@@ eller .
i offer for the taste , not to gu@@ zz@@ le .
if you 're thir@@ st@@ y , drink water .
would you like a fa@@ g , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as ?
ernest gave them to me .
oh no . bou@@ gr@@ as , he always st@@ icks to the p@@ ipe .
say , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as ...
why do you have a be@@ ard ?
it 's to hide the ugly mug underneath !
now then , back to work !
look here , i think you 're filling them up too much .
you trying to get me slo@@ shed ?
- see you , ernest .
- see you !
well , my cell@@ ar rats ?
mission accompl@@ ished , boss !
but there are 3 bott@@ les that are a bit clo@@ ud@@ y .
that 's normal , it 's the bottom of the bar@@ rel .
you can have them .
not a bad lot , but i can 't sell them .
- good . now , we agreed on 25 franc ?
- yes , that 's it .
- here , then .
- thanks .
here , this is for you .
ten francs ?
but it 's too much , mr@@ .@@ bou@@ gr@@ as .
didn 't you say you needed extra dou@@ gh to help your cousin ?
and to top it off , here 's an eg@@ g@@ plant for sup@@ per@@ time .
here .
- but why ?
- it 's not for your work ,
i o@@ wed your mother money , but i forgot .
you can check the led@@ gers , it 's all in writing .
in that case , thanks !
that should help with your keep .
your cousin will probably want you to stay , now .
- what can i get you ?
- anything you want , except red .
nothing for me , i have er@@ rand@@ s .
- so long , ernest .
so long , bou@@ gr@@ as .
- so long , kid ! - how about white wine ?
- can 't say no to that .
that must be him !
you know how late you are ?
where were you ?
- we started without you .
- forgive me , elo@@ die .
- good lord , you 're re@@ ek@@ ing of wine !
- and what 's this ?
a leg of ve@@ al !
leg of ve@@ al ?
- you didn 't ste@@ al it i hope ?
- no . no . i 've been working with bou@@ gr@@ as at the tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tique .
in that case , that 's really nice of you .
i even brought you some wine , jean .
beau@@ jol@@ p@@ if ?
let 's have a sw@@ ig !
- would you like a bit ?
- sure i would .
- so , how is it ?
- not bad , not bad .
excellent , yeah !
see ? he 's not a bad kid , after all .
we would keep you if we were rich , you know .
no wor@@ ries . i could stop going to school .
i could s@@ cro@@ unge a bit more with bou@@ gr@@ as .
i would ear@@ n more money and help you out .
don 't be stupid , olivier !
you think your mom would appro@@ ve of you turning into a street ur@@ chin ?
you don 't want to go to school , anymore ?
end up as a dro@@ p-@@ out like bou@@ gr@@ as ?
if i could have stayed longer in school , we wouldn 't be here today .
he 's right . you 're lucky to have your aunt victoria .
- we 're too young .
- and you don 't want me around .
that 's not true .
don 't say that ..
but taking care of you is a sacrif@@ ice .
if he had to work , people would say we 're exploit@@ ing him .
his aunt should take him in .
no ! you also said she 's a co@@ w .
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , you 'll still go to school .
alright , jean .
may i have some more ?
you certainly have an ap@@ petite this evening .
i 'm flat@@ tered .
here you go !
thanks , elo@@ die .
look at this sco@@ und@@ rel .
no wonder his plate emp@@ tied so fast !
show me your nap@@ kin .
it 's for a kit@@ ten .
a kit@@ ten ?
you think we 're stupid ?
no , i swear it !
a kit@@ ten eating po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
that 'll be the day !
come on , give it to me .
no , wait !
don 't throw it out !
why not ?
you 'll see .
go ahead , put it in .
that way , we 'll have an hour or two to our@@ selves .
yes , you 're right .
here you go , olivier .
go feed that kit@@ ten of yours .
- thanks , jean .
- alright , scr@@ am .
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
and you turn off the light .
very well .
see you tomorrow , elo@@ die !
- no funny stuff , okay ?
- don 't worry .
your v@@ est !
thanks .
elo@@ die ...
i think we 're too soft on him .
the longer he st@@ ays the more he gets att@@ ached .
you think i 'm not getting att@@ ached ?
what are you doing here ?
thanks , kid .
sm@@ ells good !
it was better when it was hot .
it 's ve@@ al with po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
good , huh ?
del@@ icious .
i 'll eat it later .
i also have a fa@@ g .
i 'm in heaven !
that 's s@@ well !
i have something for you .
it 's an anth@@ ology on the language of flowers .
i didn 't know flowers could talk .
not on their own , of course .
if a man off@@ ers one to a woman , it spe@@ aks without making a sound .
each flower has its own meaning .
that is the language of flowers .
hey , olivier , want to join me ?
i 'm going to the basilica to see the night over paris .
i can 't go .
don 't you see i 'm chat@@ ting with my buddy ?
your loss .
girls ....
they 're such le@@ ech@@ es .
you won 't always think that .
given that a lab@@ o@@ rer ear@@ ns 35 franc per day , and works 48 weeks of 5 and half days each year , what could he set aside at the end of the year ?
a few be@@ ans , monsieur !
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , bring to me whatever you are reading .
the language of flowers ?
we have a po@@ et in our mid@@ st .
let 's see if you 've at least learned something .
what is , according to this le@@ af@@ let , the meaning of ... the o@@ ak-@@ le@@ af ger@@ an@@ ium ?
it symbol@@ iz@@ es true friend@@ ship .
that is correct .
the white japan@@ ese cam@@ ell@@ ia ?
perfect beauty .
- and the acacia ?
- eleg@@ ance , monsieur .
you see , if you want , you 'd get better gr@@ ades !
yes . yes .
- hello , m@@ ado .
- hello , olivier .
for me ?
oh , you shouldn 't have !
they are magn@@ ific@@ ent .
they didn 't cost me anything .
i went to the opening of les hal@@ les with bou@@ gr@@ as .
we gave a hand to a flower mer@@ chant .
red roses .
you know what it means when a man off@@ ers red roses to a woman ?
no , not at all .
it 's a statement of passion@@ ate love .
oh yeah ?
would you like a cup of tea ?
oh yeah ! i love tea , now .
here .
take it .
tell me , any news from your friend david ?
no .
and i wrote him so many letters .
don 't worry , i 'm sure you 'll get one soon .
i don 't care anymore .
i 'll make new friends .
that i am sure of .
now .
i must get dressed .
you stay here and finish your tea .
i just step into the other room .
i 'm keeping warm all over , my little heart is as white as a to@@ ad 's under@@ belly .
wor@@ ries , i have but a few .
troubles , i couldn 't care less .
what 's gotten over you ?
i got prom@@ ot@@ ed to film editor at pa@@ the cinema .
really ? that 's s@@ well !
you bet your ass !
i 'm starting on the new@@ s@@ re@@ els , and after that i can work ... my way up to the big movies .
that dress i saw in the galer@@ ies , maybe we can af@@ ford it , now ?
elo@@ die , i can see it right now over your shoulders .
and the tan@@ dem .
we 'll get the bike too . for our sunday out@@ ings !
oh yeah !
say !
maybe you can keep me now ?
if i have the means , olivier .
if i have the means .
you know , elo@@ die is pregnant .
can you imagine ?
a baby and you in this tiny apartment ?
you 're expecting a baby ?
well , yes .
that 's ne@@ at !
when is it due ?
well , in 5 months .
you see , it still gives you some time .
anyway , i 'm really happy for you .
i forgot , olivier !
you must hurry .
mr. pri@@ vat came to see you .
mr. pri@@ vat ?
he 's in paris ?
yes , just a sto@@ po@@ ver .
he 's waiting for you at the mar@@ ca@@ det palace to see a movie .
so go !
you got@@ ta hurry .
don 't forget your v@@ est !
when our teacher tal@@ ks about the war , he never men@@ tions any of this .
is that how it really was ?
far worse .
it was a s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ house .
i shouldn 't have brought you to see this .
for a child , it 's too sad .
i remember a time .
papa would always say : " that fucking war . "
what was my dad like ?
i 've told you already .
you father and i were friends long before the war .
he was in@@ ju@@ red during the as@@ sault on the marne .
he wrote me saying they had cap@@ tured lots of german soldiers ... completely drunk from gu@@ zz@@ ling too much champagne .
ours !
our champagne !
he got hurt two days later , during a counter@@ - strike .
your dad was right :
" fucking war ! "
my mom would always answer him ... that it was thanks to the war they got married .
father was wo@@ unded and mother was the nurse , and that 's how it all started .
it 's a beautiful story .
yes , olivier .
it 's a beautiful story .
come on .
there 's bou@@ gr@@ as !
he 's a sand@@ wich man , now ?
play@@ bill ?
one for you .
get your play@@ bill right here .
he 's my buddy .
i 'll introdu@@ ce you .
hey , hey , my artiller@@ y@@ man , on vac@@ ation i see ?
enjoying the fl@@ ick ?
good day , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as .
i 'd like you to meet mr. pri@@ vat . he was my mother 's best friend .
we just saw the wooden cros@@ ses .
it was well done .
in ter@@ ms of blood@@ ba@@ ths , this one was well done , yes .
you got nothing better to do than take him to a war film ?
you shouldn 't say that .
mr. pri@@ vat is a hero .
you 're nut@@ s if you think that !
as if there were heroes in a war .
in a war there 're only victi@@ ms and assassin@@ s .
how many krau@@ ts did he kill ?
ten ?
twenty ? fifty ?
that 's it ?
and today , we pro@@ udly sport med@@ als !
what you really want is that he ad@@ mi@@ res you .
wasn 't it enough to lose an arm ?
would it please you , if he also goes to war .
no , sir .
you 're wrong .
i wish he will never have to .
that 's what we fought for .
yeah , yeah , la-@@ de@@ e-@@ da , la-@@ de@@ e-@@ la !
yeah , i 've heard it before .
i know the tune .
you 'd better take him to luna park instead , to see charlie chap@@ lin .
it would be fun@@ nier .
ah , what the fuck .
you make me sick .
- see you later , mates !
- wait ...
bou@@ gr@@ as ...
as for you , don 't bother me .
you 're a tw@@ it , just like the others .
i don 't ever want to see you .
good morning , monsieur bou@@ gr@@ as .
something wrong , olivier ?
no , i 'm fine .
it 's just that mr. bou@@ gr@@ as doesn 't want to see me anymore .
ah , i wouldn 't worry about it .
he 's a bit like me .
sometimes , we get angry at the whole world .
it comes and goes .
- want to do something for me ?
- yes , what ?
a shel@@ f came down in my room .
no sweat . after school , i 'll fix it imp@@ ec@@ cable .
- see you later .
- see you later .
there .
just like new .
thank you , olivier .
here , could you place this on the shel@@ f ?
sure .
oh , dar@@ n !
" the terrible fall of daniel . "
" daniel , king of the trap@@ eze . "
" the terrible fall .
last night in paris , during his performance ...
" at the winter cir@@ cus , the famous trap@@ eze artist daniel ...
" fell 12 m to the ground . "
" daniel 's terrible accident . "
" un@@ belie@@ v@@ able but true :
daniel still the best . "
do you know this daniel ?
he 's a buddy of yours ?
it was you ?
you were flying the trap@@ eze ?
here , that was you ?
if you don 't mind , this st@@ ays between us .
but why ?
out of van@@ ity .
you see , i still rather inspire fear than p@@ ity .
oh my , you sure have a lot of books !
oh , once i had many more .
i sol@@ d nearly all of them .
everyone has to eat .
what a shame .
i 've become att@@ ached to this neigh@@ bour@@ hood , to this street .
i wouldn 't want to leave it and wind up in an old people 's home , even if i was better off , given my condition .
i understand you .
i don 't want to leave either .
and why would you ?
jean and elo@@ die will soon have a baby .
when the baby is born , they won 't be able to keep me .
there might a way .
look , behind the cup@@ board . that 's your cousin 's place .
so that means i sleep right over there .
i say , that is funny !
here , i 'd like to give you a book .
not just any book , mind you .
it 's a bit thick , but once you 've read it , life and books will no longer hold secrets for you .
pretty heavy , hey ?
it 's the weight of knowledge .
" am@@ ou@@ il@@ lante ,
" nou@@ n , feminine and ad@@ jec@@ tive :
" co@@ w ready to cal@@ ve .
" amor ,
" latin word meaning love :
" physical or emo@@ tional attr@@ action of one person toward another , "
" physical or emo@@ tional attr@@ action of one person toward another . "
cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re .
five . and i went easy on you .
you obviously want to be a box@@ er , but it looks like ... you forgot to take your glo@@ ves off before starting your es@@ say .
lo@@ ul@@ ou .
zero .
not a bad piece , even funny at times .
however , gang@@ ster is not a profes@@ sion .
if your ide@@ als only tend toward dou@@ gh , sho@@ o@@ ters and broad@@ s , you 'll hit the slam@@ mer faster than a jac@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
why did your write your es@@ say in verse ?
i don 't know , it 's more beautiful !
" he who pus@@ hes his tal@@ ents accompl@@ ishes nothing with grace , " my child .
anyway , i do see the effort .
and in ter@@ ms of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , you went the extra mile .
however ... i do ask myself , why do all of your aspir@@ ations start with the letter a ?
you con@@ templ@@ ate becoming an : acro@@ bat , archit@@ ect , administrat@@ or , athle@@ te , ar@@ mo@@ rer , avi@@ ator , amb@@ ass@@ ador , astr@@ olog@@ er , anthro@@ pol@@ og@@ ist ... and artist@@ ic ly@@ ric@@ ist .
careful not to spread yourself too thin .
i gave you an 8 .
it 's a little har@@ sh , but see it as an encour@@ ag@@ ement .
ernest .
i would have liked to see you become as imagin@@ ative .
you 'd like to be a coff@@ e@@ e-@@ shop ow@@ ner , like papa .
excuse me , mr. gast@@ oun@@ et .
children , our country is facing hard times .
president dou@@ mer was shot down at noon today by a mad@@ man .
his situation is ho@@ pel@@ ess .
consequ@@ ently , you will all go home to your parents .
and tomorrow you will stay home as a sign of national mour@@ ning .
- yeah !
all this will finish badly , very badly ...
and so , in this edition , we 'll follow the funeral of president paul dou@@ mer ... and the resul@@ ts of the legislat@@ ive elections , and also the le@@ ft@@ ist swing in par@@ li@@ ament .
so ... for dou@@ mer 's funeral , we went all out .
we have 7 camer@@ as .
one at the entrance and exit of the ely@@ see , and all along the proces@@ sion route in paris .
this way , we 'll have a good as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment of the crowd : tens of thous@@ ands of mour@@ ners .
the assas@@ sin :
gor@@ yo@@ ul@@ ov .
it 's the only record we have .
we have no foot@@ age .
and we 'll end with the elections .
it 's familiar ground , but at least we 'll give out some resul@@ ts .
the left w@@ ins 91 se@@ ats .
lights !
that 's good .
it 's good , but i want everything ... you 've got on the assassin@@ ation and funeral of dou@@ mer .
nobody car@@ es about the elections .
especially since your foot@@ age is as dul@@ l as dis@@ h@@ water .
yes , you 're right .
sir , although the foot@@ age of dou@@ mer 's funeral is powerful , the real important event are the elections .
for the first time in many years , the left reg@@ ained a major@@ ity !
young man , the people want to see something spectac@@ ular .
the face of charles lind@@ ber@@ gh when told about the death of his son , or the s@@ kat@@ er sonia hen@@ ie , or dou@@ mer on his death bed ; not what they read about 3 days before .
agreed . but we can 't down@@ play the up@@ surge by the left .
first of all , the left is not yet the rul@@ ing party .
second , learn to mind your own business .
oh , but it is my business !
i 'm a cit@@ izen just like you .
alright . we 'll see about that later .
you should have seen the way i na@@ iled the produc@@ er today !
he didn 't even want to talk about the elections !
aren 't you 're not pushing your luck ?
you just started there . i know you with your big mouth !
oh , don 't get me started !
what do you call this ?
- it 's a surprise .
- really ?
who made this hole in the wall ?
don 't worry .
the land@@ lord made it .
oh yeah ?
what for ? well , when the neigh@@ b@@ our moved out , i told the land@@ lord we needed more space for the baby .
- he had to study the wall 's integr@@ ity .
- did he say yes ?
yes . he 'll come to talk about rais@@ ing the rent .
that would be fantast@@ ic !
we wouldn 't have to move to a larger flat .
right .
l '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee used to live here .
yes . this morning , he was taken to the old people 's home .
he asked to be taken .
he found it harder to get up the stairs .
we won 't see him anymore ?
well , one man 's loss is another man 's gain .
listen , before chec@@ king out , he left some books for you .
have a look .
- may i say something ?
- go ahead .
with this room , if i sleep here ... i 'll be less of a bur@@ den .
we want this to be the baby 's room .
i know , but in the mean@@ time .
you , when your mind is set on something ...
alright , then .
until the baby is born , you can squ@@ at .
- yeah !
- and tomorrow , i 'll take you to the studio . you 'll work all day as an extra on a movie set .
look at that .
- what a beauty !
- it 's a del@@ age .
last word of ad@@ vice : when you 're on the set , and the red light is on , you got@@ ta shut up .
- especially when you hear the cl@@ apper .
- understood . and never look in the camera .
let 's go say hello .
- good morning , fern@@ and .
- jean , i need to talk to you . the kid 's an extra for the day . i 'm taking him now on the set .
jean , it 's not about the kid .
it 's about you . you can 't go in anymore .
you 're jo@@ king , right !
no , i 'm not jo@@ king . they 're letting you go .
here 's you 're last pay .
i 'm fired ? just like that ?
i want to see a manager !
the boss is not here this morning .
come back this afternoon .
but i doubt they 'll change their min@@ ds .
well i won 't take this lying down .
they don 't know who they 're de@@ aling with .
i 'm not going !
no . you must go .
we 'll take the other street and bl@@ end in with the ex@@ tras .
- jean ! - don 't give me a rough time .
- but , jean !
why must you always talk about polit@@ ics ?
how will we manage now with the land@@ lord ?
we 'll have to pay for the hole .
i 'm sure we 'll find a solution .
did you see about getting your job back as a boom oper@@ ator ?
ye@@ p . they already filled the position .
but that can 't be !
why must this be happening to us right now ?
here .
my wag@@ es for being an extra .
you can have it .
i hope it hel@@ ps to pay for the baby 's room .
now there 's a repe@@ at performance !
we 're in the shit hole and all you can think of is yourself .
you don 't care about us .
you just want to make sure you can live here ! no , jean .
that 's not true , i swear it .
i swear it !
you 're sel@@ fish !
hypo@@ cr@@ ite !
i don 't want your fucking dou@@ gh !
listen ! i 'm out of action .
there 's no way we can support you .
get the hell out !
but , jean !
why did you tell him that ?
hey , kit@@ ty .
min@@ ou .
come back !
fire !
fire ! fire !
hey , where do you think you 're going ?
did you start this fire ?
you 're in big trouble you little br@@ at !
- but i didn 't do anything , sir .
- and this , what do you call this ?
why did you start this fire , miser@@ able ar@@ son@@ ist .
- you 're parents will have to pay .
- they 're both dead .
you don 't get off that easy .
anymore tr@@ icks up your sle@@ eve ?
leave him alone .
i know this kid . he 's the haber@@ das@@ her 's or@@ phan .
- he even st@@ ole from his cous@@ ins .
- he 's a ho@@ ol@@ igan .
- he belong@@ s in a reform school !
- but i did nothing wrong !
c '@@ mon fol@@ ks , what 's this : the apo@@ calyp@@ se !
c '@@ mon , leave him alone .
this rap@@ ac@@ ious mut@@ t just set fire to a dw@@ elling of honest fol@@ ks !
" honest fol@@ ks ! " ha , ha !
show me half a dozen ! even one or two if you can !
have you never been a kid and done stupid things ?
c '@@ mon ! clear away !
c '@@ mon , hop on , kid !
c '@@ mon , c '@@ mon !
che@@ ers , mates !
rise up , rise up !
the hour is near to start the revol@@ t !
the hour is near to start the revol@@ t .
y@@ ip@@ per !
now my ol@@ ive .
hang in there . it 's all over .
will i have to go to reform school ?
of course not . no reform school .
you 're with jean and elo@@ die , you 're not alone .
as a matter of fact , jean lost his job .
- they can 't keep me anymore .
- shit . talk about bad luck .
i sure hope i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee didn 't leave for nothing .
why do you say that ?
he made me swear i wouldn 't tell anyone , especially you .
he left his room for your benef@@ it .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
he wanted you to stay .
so he arrang@@ ed a meeting ... between elo@@ die and the land@@ lord .
but i didn 't want him to leave !
- tell me it 's not true .
- i 'm afraid it is .
that 's why you can 't go .
do you understand ?
c '@@ mon , artiller@@ y@@ man , we can 't lose hope , right ?
you 'll see , things will work out for jean .
and that little mis@@ hap with the fire , it 's nothing serious .
not at all ...
besides , nothing should be taken seriously .
- so you 're not angry with me anymore ?
- angry ?
- oh , it 's you .
- ye@@ p , it 's me . i forgot my keys .
elo@@ die !
elo@@ die . are you there ?
- no .
she 'll be back later tonight .
- what are you talking about ?
ernest asked her to stay longer to help him at the tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tique .
- but the trans@@ at is closed in the evening .
- no , no . it 's the ann@@ ual dinner of the mont@@ mar@@ tre fel@@ low@@ ship alum@@ ni .
it will end late .
and you , what 's new ?
nothing .
i 've been looking for work for over a month .
" sorry , sir , there is nothing . "
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
" there 's nothing " " there 's nothing " !
fucking crisis !
one of these days , the ke@@ g will blow !
the mis@@ ers will still get away with it , but not for long !
they 'll get what 's coming to them !
we 'll make min@@ cem@@ eat out of them !
you hear me , olivier ?
look at what i prepared .
stu@@ ffed tom@@ ato@@ es !
- you made this ?
mother taught me how .
- i 'll get it , i 'll get it .
- no , stay here , i 'll get it .
- oh . it 's the char@@ ming m@@ ado !
- good evening , jean .
well , do come in , come in .
sorry to distur@@ b you ...
i was supposed to go out with a girlfriend , but her mom fell sick .
- so i thought maybe you would like to ...
no .
not exactly .
i was thinking more about olivier ...
there is no school tomorrow , i promised to take him to the restaurant .
if that would make him happy .
right olivier ?
would you like to go out with m@@ ado ?
oh yes , jean .
thank you !
i won 't bring him back late .
i hope not !
we 'll leave a key under the mat .
here . i brought you a tie so you 'll look eleg@@ ant .
thank you .
i 'll put it on right now . and some gom@@ ina gel .
alright , get a move on !
so ... everything arrang@@ ed for tomorrow ?
you 're certain ?
yes .
at what time they 'll pick him up ?
at 2 pm . his uncle henri will pick him up .
poor kid ...
he 's doesn 't know yet ?
no .
it will be a terrible blow .
yes , i know .
anyway , thanks for taking him out tonight .
i really like him , you know .
i 'm ready !
oh , my . really clas@@ sy , olivier !
monsieur will taste the wine .
ah , it is good , huh !
a little warm .
it is not warm , young man , it is ambi@@ ent .
my friend bou@@ gr@@ as says the saint-@@ em@@ il@@ ion is better when brought up from the cell@@ ar .
would you have a bottle from the cell@@ ar ?
we do . but if i may , i would not re@@ commen@@ d it .
but monsieur maurice !
if it 's madame 's wish , we get a bottle from the cell@@ ar .
and may madame and monsieur enjoy an excellent meal .
thank you .
les@@ son number 5 : the client is king .
forgive me , madame , or ma@@ demo@@ is@@ elle ... your face looks familiar .
i 'm sure we 've met before , but i don 't seem to remember .
- perhaps you can help me ?
- sir !
can 't you see i 'm with my fi@@ ance ?
and , b@@ ingo !
les@@ son number 6 :
never bother a lady if she hasn 't been introduc@@ ed to you .
to draw her attention , have a gar@@ con deli@@ ver a card .
or flowers .
- to our health !
- ah no . you must simply raise your glass and smile as you look at me .
very well , m@@ ado .
you could then propose a to@@ ast , but not usually with the ladies .
was everything satisfac@@ tory ?
it was .... ex@@ quis@@ ite !
- i would like some sweet stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries .
- and for the young man ?
how about a nice paris-@@ brest ?
it 's very good .
- isn 't that a bic@@ y@@ cle race ?
- no , it 's also a cake .
- sir , do you have plu@@ m pu@@ d@@ ding ?
- most certainly .
- let 's go for the plu@@ m pu@@ d@@ ding !
- very well , monsieur .
apparently , it 's as good as love .
i 'd like to thank you again , m@@ ado .
it was really ... really ... rom@@ antic !
- ah , i 'll give you back the tie .
- no .
keep it . you 'll have a sou@@ venir of me .
a sou@@ venir ?
but we 'll see each other soon .
that 's what i meant .
you can keep it forever .
alright .
so long , gentlem@@ an .
elo@@ die !
elo@@ die !
hello , ernest .
what did he say ? - nothing .
i didn 't tell him .
- what ?
you were supposed to tell him last night .
henri will arrive in half an hour .
but surely , we must tell him now .
i was wondering if we couldn 't keep him .
listen , jean , we 're not starting that again .
it 's not possible .
god knows when you 'll find a job .
and in 3 months i won 't be able to work because of the baby . i 'm sad too .
but that 's how it is . nothing we can do . elo@@ die .
the order for no@@ .@@ 4 ! be right there !
it 's coming .
bon appe@@ tit .
where is he now ?
he bor@@ rowed your fire cups to treat bou@@ gr@@ as .
well , you 're going to tell him right now .
almost done ?
- only two more to go .
- ah well , go for it .
fir@@ ing up !
oh , my !
if you can he@@ al me with those , i 'll buy you a drink .
mother would often treat me .
she said it 's better than medi@@ cation .
okay , do the last one .
fir@@ ing up !
o@@ oh , that one 's really hot .
now all we have to do is wait .
come in !
gre@@ et@@ ings , bou@@ gr@@ as !
gre@@ et@@ ings , jean .
so , you 're playing doctor , now ?
he 's good at it too . my lord !
it 's gon@@ na be a hot day .
does that surprise you ?
it is after all , the beginning of jul@@ y .
you know , olivier , in life , there are events more serious than others .
but they shouldn 't lead us to over@@ -@@ dramat@@ ize .
everything works out .
all one needs is to show a little will@@ power .
isn 't that so ?
yes .
olivier , i want you to listen to me .
i have news to tell you .
don 't worry , it 's actually good news .
as you know , henri has become your legal guardian .
that means ... you 'll be like his son .
can you imagine just how lucky you are ?
don 't look so glo@@ om@@ y .
you know we did everything we could to keep you .
but in the long run , it 's for your own good .
from now on , you 'll live in a large apartment , with wal@@ l-@@ to-@@ wall car@@ pet@@ s .
two hous@@ em@@ aids .
two !
you 'll be able to go to college and get a real education .
not to mention , lucky dog , a summer vac@@ ation in tour@@ aine .
a few dozen hectar@@ es , apparently .
you 'll be living like a king !
we didn 't want to tell you so@@ oner so as not to ... as not to ...
well , that 's it .
your uncle 's car should arrive soon .
you mean now ?
right now ? well , yes .
right now .
but couldn 't i go stay with pri@@ vat instead ?
that , my boy , is your fault .
you had your chance .
now .
i go down to wait for the car .
i 'll let you know .
i got@@ ta pack a suit@@ case .
no .
you won 't have to .
it 's already pack@@ ed .
it 's at the trans@@ at .
so long , bou@@ gr@@ as .
take those yo@@ gur@@ t j@@ ars off of me .
c '@@ mon , do it quick .
you 'll see , mr. bou@@ gr@@ as .
usually , if all goes well , in one hour , you should be feeling better .
i 'm sure i 'm will .
thank you , my l@@ ad .
you 've been a good nurse .
you took good care of me .
never mind that , i 'll put those away .
is olivier ready ?
now , now , artiller@@ y@@ man .
you 're not gon@@ na start wh@@ in@@ ing ?
you 're not a girl are you ?
no , mr. bou@@ gr@@ as .
c '@@ mon , then ...
let 's shake on it , for old time 's sake ?
it 's for me ?
i can 't take it .
it 's too nice .
i can 't .
there you go .
c '@@ mon , get out of here my ol@@ ive .
c '@@ mon .
get out of here . sc@@ at !
go !
come on , olivier , you 're not saying goodbye ?
don 't worry , you 'll be like our son , now .
so long , ol@@ ive .
you 're in luck .
take a load of this car !
goodbye , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
- see you soon , olivier !
- goodbye , ol@@ ive !
you like min@@ t lol@@ lipo@@ ps , i think .
where are we going , uncle ?
your place ?
you know , we had a look at your school gr@@ ades , you 'll need classes this summer to catch up .
the director was categor@@ ical .
the director ?
the director of the college where you will now further your studies .
it 's a good estab@@ l@@ ishment . you 'll see .
and one of the best in chur@@ ning out succes@@ s@@ ful students .
mar@@ ceau , our son , atten@@ ded this college .
even got an award for latin in the main con@@ test event .
how un@@ fortun@@ ate he 's not as heal@@ thy as you !
your mother wanted you to get a good education .
ah ... here we are .
i 'll spend the entire summer here ?
but you 'll see , you 'll enjoy it here .
come , let 's go see the director .
say , how long are you staying in tour@@ aine , with your del@@ age ?
my chau@@ ff@@ eur is pr@@ ud@@ ent , but still it 's almost 3 hours to drive the 220 km .
all the same , it 's fantast@@ ic . what will they think of next ?
this will be your bed .
please remember to pass along my reg@@ ards to your wife and to mar@@ ceau .
- how is he ? - doing fine .
we hope to bring him home by the end of this summer .
however , with this ill@@ ness , a sword of dam@@ oc@@ les always hang@@ s above our heads .
i share your concer@@ ns .
- dear uncle , may i ... - two minutes .
olivier .
i hope you 'll be as bright as your cousin .
uncle , i need to use the to@@ il@@ et !
have you been following gor@@ go@@ ul@@ ov 's tri@@ al ?
it 's an ab@@ omin@@ ation !
ah , is the child 's uniform ready ?
it 's the right size .
at least , i hope .
here you go my boy , try this on for me .
what 's the matter with you ?
he pissed himself !
- oliver ... what 's wrong with you ?
- never mind , i 'll take care of it .
come with me , you fil@@ thy little boy .
i beg your for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , m. le directeur .
make nothing of it .
how long ago did his mother pass away ?
4 or 5 months .
i 'm worried we might have been a little hast@@ y in all of this .
would you mind if i kept him for this evening ?
no , not at all .
i 'll try to che@@ er him up .
do you like to go see ma@@ yol , the singer ?
not really , uncle .
what then would please you ?
- i 'd love to go to the lap@@ in ag@@ ile .
- the cab@@ aret in mont@@ mar@@ tre ?
that estab@@ l@@ ishment does not allow children .
i used to go with my mother .
" par@@ le@@ z-@@ moi d '@@ amour
" re@@ dit@@ es-@@ moi des choses ten@@ dres
" vo@@ tre beau discours
" mon co@@ eur n '@@ est pas las de l '@@ ent@@ endre
" pour@@ vu que toujours
" vous repe@@ ti@@ ez ces mots supre@@ mes "
it 's funny ...
the last time i was here with mama , we were sitting at this very table .
why ever would your mother bring you here ?
we came to dance .
tang@@ os , especially .
olivier , are you crying ?
no .
it 's nothing .
we should not have come here .
it will only make you miser@@ able . no .
on the contr@@ ary .
i 'm happy .
very happy .
careful , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
your uncle could have brought you back so@@ oner .
go to bed now . go on .
that should te@@ ach you not to wake everybody up .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , don 't be a sho@@ w-@@ off .
i run a quiet dor@@ m and it will stay that way .
we 're not in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
- but it wasn 't me , sir . - silence !
we don 't answer back , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
and now , go to sleep . everybody .
you 're a s@@ nit@@ ch , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f !
did you hear that ?
he 's from mont@@ mar@@ tre .
and already s@@ nit@@ ching on us !
no one tal@@ ks to him .
he 's now on quar@@ ant@@ ine .
- yeah , good idea .
- silence !
hey ur@@ chin . you can 't play with us .
we don 't need you .
de@@ bezie@@ ux . well done : 16 / 20 .
sar@@ on , almost perfect .
once again , you 've ear@@ ned 19 .
i kept the best for last .
no , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f did not get 20 .
after only 2 months , i wouldn 't expect as much from him .
luc@@ kil@@ y for him , there are no marks below zero , because chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f would have sco@@ red -@@ 6.5 .
and for your enjo@@ y@@ ment , i will demonstr@@ ate how chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f ... trans@@ lat@@ es the famous phrase :
" if you want peace
" prepare for war . "
you haven 't made any progress during the summer , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
being mr. des@@ rous@@ seau 's neph@@ ew or not , you are not exemp@@ t from being intellig@@ ent .
follow your cousin mar@@ ceau 's ex@@ ample . he was my best student .
good morning , olivier .
i 'm mar@@ ceau , your cousin .
we 've met at the house on a few occas@@ ions .
it 's pretty hard to forget .
my latin teacher never stop@@ s talking about you .
good morning , mar@@ ceau .
no need to be formal , l@@ ad .
you 're a po@@ et ?
we 'll understand each other !
" child of a fallen le@@ af ,
" subj@@ ec@@ ted to every wind
" as the weeks and months of summer pass
" wrapped in the sheets of my friends ' sol@@ itude
" i call the names of bou@@ gr@@ as , m@@ ado , i '@@ ar@@ aig@@ nee
" no answer to be heard . they have forgotten me .
" and so i ask :
what has become of them ?
" you , my parents as distant as strang@@ ers be
" what secrets have you not dar@@ ed share with me ? "
not bad .
insp@@ i@@ red by ru@@ te@@ be@@ uf , and a bit of a te@@ ar@@ jer@@ ker , but ... given your situation , this piece is fit@@ ting .
that poem is private !
perhaps i should te@@ ach you the fin@@ er aspec@@ ts of caes@@ ura .
i don 't need your help .
couldn 't i be of use to you in latin ?
- what about your sister ?
- mind your own business .
i 'm starting to like you , ob@@ sc@@ ure little friend .
i was afraid you would bor@@ e me .
my parents dum@@ ped you here for the whole summer ?
ah , the bastar@@ ds !
they could have brought you with them to tour@@ aine at least !
i sympath@@ ize . i spent the last 8 months in the sanat@@ orium .
i 'm cu@@ red , finally . i 'm just out and i bring you back home !
isn 't life beautiful ?
the head@@ master will never con@@ sent .
you 're mother p@@ icks me up tomorrow .
ni@@ hil obst@@ at .
i 've just seen the principal , and , between two latin qu@@ otes , i 've told him that my mother had instruc@@ ted me to take you home . you are free .
i release you from the bon@@ ds of sla@@ very .
long live freedom !
long live andre breton !
- who 's this breton ?
- the po@@ pe of sur@@ realis@@ m , of course !
the po@@ pe of what ? my god !
i 'll need to tend to your education .
you are now enter@@ ing the holy of hol@@ ies .
you may enter .
you are familiar with this apartment ? yes .
i mean not that familiar .
you must always look im@@ pressed by the lux@@ ury ... of good standing that is the foundation of my par@@ ent 's succes@@ s .
they 're really quite vain .
mother , especially .
she 's a great lady , my mother .
she 's wonderful !
i 'm often angry with her , but i ad@@ ore her anyway .
as for my father , he 's a dre@@ amer who can 't get over having become a succes@@ s@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man .
this is the living room .
- you know what he really wanted to be ?
- an opera singer .
- how did you know that ?
- because he told me , of course !
- we went to the lap@@ in ag@@ ile together .
- that 's just like him !
he took advantage of you to get away .
you 've already reached a level of trust with him ?
yes , but he doesn 't want me talking about it .
to my mother , perhaps .
as for me , you can talk about anything .
this is the din@@ ing room .
impres@@ sive .
come , i 'll take you to your room .
put your lug@@ gage on the bed and follow me .
and this ... is my la@@ ir .
you like jazz ?
are you familiar with the duke ?
no .
what about louis armstrong ?
no , not him either .
he 's giving a paris concert at the end of this month .
can you believe it ?
either way , i 'm going to meet him this year .
my parents have offered me a trip to new york for my holid@@ ays .
getting sick does have its advantage : your parents will grant your every wish .
can you imagine ?
i 'm going to spend new year 's eve at the cot@@ ton club ...
but i have a friend who 's living in new york !
his name is david z@@ ob@@ er .
i have no news of him .
well then , give me his address .
i will find this little buddy of yours .
are you familiar with ben@@ zo@@ in ?
no .
take a seat .
you 'll get to know it .
- it 's an in@@ toxic@@ ating oil .
- for cook@@ ing ?
of course not !
i 'm talking about the mind , not the body .
do you like this piece ?
yeah , really cool .
indu@@ bit@@ ably !
duke ell@@ ington !
isn 't this dangerous for someone with tubercul@@ osis .
that , my dear , is the least of my wor@@ ries .
besides , i 'm cu@@ red .
you scared ?
no !
- you 've never smo@@ ked before ?
- yes , quite often .
some " ich li@@ f " .
my god , what an accent !
high life ! " vie elevee . "
high life .
you will experience the elev@@ ation of soul@@ s , the commun@@ ion of spir@@ its .
you see , me ... i would come across as a type of laf@@ ca@@ dio .
who 's that ?
- the vatic@@ an cel@@ lars .
andre gide .
you know him ? - no .
the perfect crime .
when you think of it , the sanat@@ orium had its mer@@ its .
i learned the two things a man must lose in his life .
his virgin@@ ity and his il@@ lus@@ ions .
here .
" there , everything is order and beauty ,
" lux@@ ury , seren@@ ity and vol@@ up@@ tuo@@ us@@ ness . "
what is vol@@ up@@ tuo@@ us@@ ness ?
that is about to manif@@ est .
don 't move , i 'll be right back .
olivier .
i 'd like you to meet jul@@ ienne , my mother 's go@@ d-@@ daughter , resi@@ dent of the demo@@ is@@ elles de la legion d '@@ honneur .
she holds my mother 's de@@ ar@@ est fer@@ vor ... when it comes to my marriage .
- jul@@ ienne , i 'd like to present ...
- i know him , mar@@ ceau .
- you 're the one who 's mother died .
- yes , that 's me .
out of kind@@ ness my parents decided to adop@@ t him .
would you like a ben@@ zo@@ in ci@@ g@@ gy ?
no , thank you .
my feet are killing me .
saint-denis is quite the walking distance .
olivier , make yourself use@@ ful .
jul@@ ienne has sore feet .
re@@ move her shoes .
come on , hurry up .
slowly , olivier !
un@@ lace them gently .
give them a mas@@ sage .
my feet are really sore .
don 't tic@@ kle me .
just give me a mas@@ sage .
look .
have you ever seen a woman before ?
have you ever seen a woman 's bre@@ asts ?
oh , you little sco@@ und@@ rel !
you 're a per@@ vert !
how dare you !
this is not your place .
now go to your room !
scr@@ am !
write me a poem about jul@@ ienne 's bre@@ asts .
- ma '@@ am , where would you like this lug@@ gage ?
- carry them to my room .
marguerite , tell the chau@@ ff@@ eur to bring in the app@@ les last .
we 'll put them in the store room .
which is master olivier 's room , now
very well , madame .
good day , mother .
did you have a nice trip ? - excellent !
where were you ?
- at the restaurant , with olivier .
we weren 't going to die of star@@ v@@ ation a@@ waiting your return .
come now .
give me a hug instead of making vile re@@ marks .
- how do you feel ?
- i feel great .
let me have a look at you .
you 're right , you do look well .
why did you bring olivier back a day so@@ oner ?
you could have let me know .
i could have avo@@ i@@ ded the de@@ tour to the college .
listen , he 'd been cou@@ ped up long enough , don 't you think ?
good day , olivier .
good day , aunt .
i suppose mar@@ ceau has already given you the grand tour ?
he has , yes .
very well . we 'll now go to your room .
since you are here , i will give you ...
- the house rules !
- that 's mean !
i hope you 'll be comfortable here .
this is where we keep the app@@ les that we bring back ... every year from our estate in mon@@ trich@@ ard .
fortunately for you , the har@@ v@@ est was not abun@@ dant this year .
i hope you like apple sau@@ ce and apple pie .
here we eat it all the time .
- these are your belong@@ ings ?
- yes , aunt .
but they re@@ ek !
well , we 'll need to get rid of them .
including the clothes you are wearing .
i will let you have mar@@ ceau 's old things . you can tell mother is from auverg@@ ne :
to her , a sp@@ ade is a sp@@ ade .
my dear child , you used to be more wit@@ ty .
- these books are yours ?
- yes , aunt .
marie bas@@ h@@ kir@@ t@@ se@@ ff ?
how un@@ expected !
sch@@ open@@ hauer ?
you mean you 're reading this at your age ?
- no , aunt .
- it so happens he has ... a certain culture .
i 've read one of his poem@@ s . it 's quite good .
anyway , what he needs most is a good bath .
i will ask marguerite to wash him in the laun@@ dry room . that 's right .
we wouldn 't want him st@@ aining the ba@@ th@@ tu@@ b .
come on , marguerite , s@@ cru@@ b harder . he 's got to shine like a new penny .
your cousin is a cute little angel .
- more so than moi , marguerite ?
- that 's not the same thing .
you 're a man , now .
alright , olivier .
come out and dry yourself .
hop , hop !
vo@@ ila !
i say , aren 't we a we@@ e bit sc@@ raw@@ ny , my little ur@@ chin ?
alright .
i 'm going to burn your clothes like madame said .
show me , olivier .
now , turn around .
it 's funny seeing you wear my old tr@@ app@@ ings .
" tr@@ app@@ ings " ?
ah , what an ast@@ ute word .
do i detec@@ t mont@@ mar@@ tre 's influence ?
mar@@ ceau , your father and i decided ... to prepare a little surprise for your home@@ coming .
jul@@ ienne will join us for dinner this evening .
she will be happy to see you .
she spoke so often of you .
your father is picking her up at the print shop after work .
- are you pleased ?
- yes , mother .
i burn !
oh how i langu@@ ish for jul@@ ienne !
i love her , not as in the under@@ world , the rav@@ ager of a thousand men , but fa@@ ith@@ ful , proud and a little diff@@ id@@ ent !
the divine ...
- good evening .
- good evening , monsieur .
god@@ mother !
good evening , god@@ mother .
my dear , how happy i am to see you .
and i 'm not the only one .
mar@@ ceau is thril@@ led that you could join us for his home@@ coming .
it 's been such a long time since you 've last seen each other .
that 's true !
i even wondered if i would recognize you !
can you imagine ?
it 's now been over a year .
seems to me like it was yesterday .
and your father , do you recognize him ?
a your age you only change every 10 years .
at my age ?
am i that old ?
anyway , you have a much better disposition than when you left .
good to see you .
good .
let us have dinner so that jul@@ ienne doesn 't get home too late .
i must get you to test drive my new del@@ age .
jul@@ ienne .
where 's olivier 's setting ?
in the kitchen .
he 's eating with the ma@@ ids , of course .
why then did you tell him he was a member of the family ?
they cu@@ red his ill@@ ness , but apparently not his character .
thank you .
mar@@ ceau , return immediately to the din@@ ing room .
your ste@@ w is truly mar@@ vel@@ ous , blanche .
thank you , m. mar@@ ceau .
for the last time , return to the din@@ ing room .
del@@ icious , don 't you think ?
blanche , see to it that m. olivier jo@@ ins us in the din@@ ing room .
- yes , madame .
- dear aunt , there 's is no need .
oh please , don 't give me that !
come on , let 's go .
look , olivier .
like this .
sorry , aunt .
it 's not your fault , olivier .
take note however that we don 't say : " sorry , " but " please excuse me . "
in conclusion , olivier , we are too good for you .
well my friend , say something .
yes .
be nice to your mother , mar@@ ceau .
what is that dress you 're wearing ?
ro@@ chas ? po@@ ire@@ t ?
no , sch@@ i@@ apar@@ elli .
what else you 'd like to know ?
i do like it .
- however ... - yes ?
your neck@@ lace doesn 't suit it .
a little flas@@ hy , don 't you think ?
we can discus@@ s it further after our meal , if you like .
excellent idea , mother .
besides , after our little cafe , you and jul@@ ienne could play us a du@@ et ?
with pleasure , go@@ d-@@ mother .
with pleasure , mother .
with pleasure , aunt .
olivier !
if you want us to keep you , you must change your attitude .
go to your room immediately .
- but , aunt ...
- immediately !
very well , aunt .
you 're worse than hitler .
mar@@ ceau , ill@@ ness doesn 't excuse everything .
i need no exc@@ uses , mother . and i 'm not longer ill .
mar@@ ceau ...
mar@@ ceau !
mar@@ ceau , wake up !
wake up !
please , wake up !
i 'm okay . don 't move .
you had a spell .
i 'll get your mother .
no , olivier .
you didn 't see a thing .
but it might be serious .
you must see a doctor .
listen , olivier .
all the tests indic@@ ate i am cu@@ red .
makes no sense to worry mother over a sudden fat@@ ig@@ ue .
mar@@ ceau !
olivier , if you are a brother to me , swear you 'll never speak about this to anyone .
okay ?
come on , swear it .
i swear , mar@@ ceau .
thanks , olivier .
... we are pleased to have him join a jam session , a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e for mister ...
louis armstrong !
i just cut my lip .
don 't mention anything to my divine .
you swear ?
dear students , some of you might wonder why ... you would need to learn latin .
the po@@ pe , monsieur . no .
now pick a word at random . - light . - perfect ex@@ ample of latin ro@@ ots .
light comes from the word lu@@ x , the light .
something that is lu@@ x-@@ ur@@ ious is something that is brilli@@ ant .
your turn to choose a word , chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f .
po@@ etr@@ y .
po@@ etr@@ y comes from the latin word po@@ esis , which in turn comes from the gre@@ ek po@@ i@@ esis , meaning creation .
dele@@ pine , which word would you like to know the ro@@ ot of ?
football .
now here 's an ex@@ ample of a barbar@@ ic term we adop@@ ted , let alone its simple trans@@ lation in our language .
" football , " in our language should mean :
ball at the foot , from the latin pedi@@ bus , meaning foot and ... excuse me ...
medical examin@@ ation visit .
- i said in silence . - visit . from the word vis .
to see . and medical , from medi@@ cus , the doctor .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f ? yes , that 's me .
- this is a surprise , olivier ! - good day , mr. leh@@ man .
i mean , doctor .
- i was about to ask you the same thing .
so did i. the number of pati@@ ents i had in my care was d@@ wind@@ ling ;
good , now open wide .
i hate myself for what happened to your mother .
perhaps i didn 't do enough for her .
- you didn 't like me very much , did you ?
- well ...
believe me , i didn 't want to take your father 's place , olivier .
i just wanted to help your mother . in any event , she didn 't like you .
i think she did a bit . now , sit straight .
for you it 's very sad . she died so young .
i see your aunt is taking good care of you .
everything is fine .
you 're in perfect health . that 's it . you can get dressed , now .
thank you , doctor .
tell me doctor ?
- i would like to ask you ...
- yes ?
when people get ... when they come down with tubercul@@ osis , can they get sick again , even after being cu@@ red ?
of course .
the terrible thing about this ill@@ ness , a real cure still hasn 't been found .
if we cou@@ gh up blood , it means we 're still sick ?
yes , and it 's really serious .
it 's typ@@ ical , as are repeated cou@@ gh@@ s , and sometimes even loss of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
- is it con@@ tag@@ ious ?
- oh yes , extre@@ mely con@@ tag@@ ious ! but why are you asking me this ? well ...
i want to write a poem on tubercul@@ osis .
on tubercul@@ osis ? yes , why not ?
it 's true , lam@@ art@@ ine ...
la dame aux cam@@ elias . thank you , doctor .
you 'll make yourself sick reading so much !
are those shoes ready yet , marguerite ?
yes , all done , madame .
good evening , olivier .
reading is a heal@@ thy ha@@ bit , olivier , but not at the table .
what are you reading ?
still reading without family !
but i gave you that one over a month ago .
i love reading it over again .
gr@@ ant@@ ed . but there are other books more essenti@@ al .
you look lovely , dear aunt .
well , aren 't you the gal@@ lant one !
this evening go@@ wn is for the french club .
henri is taking me . you should say to the " comedie
- francaise , " mother .
how could he possibly understand , he 's unver@@ sed .
i know it 's saturday , but getting up at sun@@ set is a bit ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , don 't you think ?
mother , i 'm prepar@@ ing myself for the time difference .
it is now 11 o '@@ clock in new york . don 't plan too far ahead , mar@@ ceau .
your trip is not official yet . don 't forget .
come , my little out@@ cast , i need to speak with you .
thank you , marguerite . you won 't believe what 's happening to me .
i 'm in love ! i met a woman yesterday at a party ga@@ thering .
- what party ?
- the commun@@ ist party !
you know , the reds . she 's simply amazing .
a mix between louise brooks and rosa luxemburg .
she 's a sur@@ real@@ ist like me .
a dream come true .
there 's just one problem : she 's 15 years older .
i want to read you a poem i wrote her .
" crim@@ son heart , pier@@ ced by faith ,
" may he who has never loved you never reach your dep@@ th . "
not bad for a start , don 't you think ? i 'm brilli@@ ant .
go ahead , tell me .
" mar@@ ceau , you 're brilli@@ ant . "
- mar@@ ceau , you 're brilli@@ ant .
- oh no , it 's pa@@ the@@ tic .
you can 't really understand po@@ etr@@ y . you 're stuck on victor hugo or le@@ conte de lis@@ le .
you know nothing about women .
you 've never been in love .
i know nothing about women ?
her name is m@@ ado .
and she 's a ta@@ xi@@ -@@ girl . - besides , we 're engag@@ ed .
- come on .
don 't make up stories just to try to im@@ press me .
you 'll see if i 'm telling the truth . you 'll see . come .
here .
rin@@ se your eyes on this .
she gave it me as a mem@@ ento .
to someone else , you mean !
you probably st@@ ole it from your mother 's bou@@ tique .
nice piece , though .
and this is her calling card .
- she gave it to me person@@ ally .
you surprise me .
- are you still seeing this m@@ ado ?
- of course not .
not since my arri@@ val here . don 't look so sad .
we 'll fix that .
- very pretty ! look . i just started a new nov@@ el .
- can you read it to me ?
- yes , of course .
" i was born , like everyone , from a mother and a father .
" and yet , i am not like everyone .
" one question haun@@ ts me :
" did my father and mother love each other ?
" were i not conce@@ iv@@ ed in a state of love , i would rather die . "
- you asked me to . you shouldn 't !
you 're viol@@ ating my inti@@ mac@@ y .
you 're a little per@@ vert ! you shouldn 't have ... you don 't understand !
it 's not because you 're older ...
you wouldn 't strike a sick person , would you ?
that 's just it , you 're really sick .
- dr leh@@ man says you 're having a rel@@ ap@@ se . - what ? who 's this dr. leh@@ man ?
you mentioned me ?
it 's the college physic@@ ian .
i asked him about tubercul@@ osis .
i know what happened to you the other day .
you were losing consci@@ ous@@ ness .
if you 're spit@@ ting blood , it 's serious and con@@ tag@@ ious .
you should in@@ form your parents .
i see where you 're going with this .
you want to stop me from leaving , send me back to the sanat@@ orium and take my place , here .
- you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau . - hypo@@ cr@@ ite !
you think i didn 't catch your little act with mother ?
" you look lovely , dear aunt . "
- as@@ s-@@ l@@ ick@@ er .
- i 'm doing it for you !
don 't forget you promised me your silence .
you 're like a brother to me .
i owe you one .
forgive me , mother .
i rather stop here .
i thought you had finally shed the awkward age , but you still rev@@ el in it .
spar@@ e me your c@@ liches .
my dear , your son is extre@@ mely ru@@ de right now .
mar@@ ceau , please !
if you want to go on your trip , you better clean up your act .
you are wanted on the telephone .
hello ! oh yes .
yes . i know who this is .
listen , it 's a delicate issue for me .
good .
i will be there in 15 minutes , under the arch@@ es .
let me see olivier .
- he 's not your child . - i know that . but i could be just like a father to him .
he chose not to go with you .
but he 's no longer in his favorite neigh@@ bour@@ hood .
please stop right there , monsieur pri@@ vat . my wife would never allow it .
on what gro@@ unds ?
you didn 't take him in out of love .
put yourself in her place .
you came to our home to kill your brother and virgin@@ ie .
and now you would want to take their son ?
i didn 't kill anyone .
and i spent time behind bars .
thir@@ teen years of my life .
i need this child to give meaning to my life .
but does he need you ?
even if we handed him over to you , think of what people would say .
believe me , i can understand your pain .
but think about the day olivier will learn everything about your past .
i 'm certain he will be able to forgive me .
but once you tell him the whole truth , you 'll be shat@@ tering the image he has of his parents .
do you think you have the right to do that ?
there 's a lad@@ der in the cour@@ t@@ yard .
you climb up , and down the other side using the street lam@@ p .
a 5 ye@@ ar-@@ old could do it . there you 'll see a bike .
you get on it , and within 10 minutes you wind up at the bou@@ chon de champagne .
here .
here 's some money to have a good time .
i 'll take your place , in case the supervis@@ or can 't sleep .
i don 't think i can pull it off .
i 'm too scared .
i 've done it do@@ zen@@ s of times without ever getting caught .
" au@@ dac@@ es fortuna ju@@ vat , " olivier .
it 's time to see if your life will be that of a she@@ ep , or if you will write it yourself , every day .
don 't you want to see m@@ ado again ?
good evening , mam '@@ z@@ elle m@@ ado good evening , m '@@ sieur hubert .
that wasn 't very smart .
are you angry with me ?
not at all !
i 'm actually moved .
you can 't follow me inside , though .
now there , don 't be sad .
wait , i have an idea .
jules ?
ask g.@@ g. to come out with his accor@@ dion .
- i have a little commission for him .
give him 10 francs , he 'll be happy .
- i 'll give him 20 ! - no , that 's too much . you asked for me , m@@ ado ?
yes , g.@@ g. here 's a young client for you .
what shall i play for you ?
olivier , what would you like ? a tango !
a tango for my little fi@@ ance .
the most beautiful tango in the world ?
- yes , that 's fine .
- i 'm not a very good dan@@ cer .
i was forced , and this is only a tempor@@ ary me@@ asure of course , to con@@ fis@@ c@@ ate this eleg@@ ant pen which arrived in the mail . - it was intended for olivier ?
- indeed , madame .
in this college , we dis@@ courage possession of val@@ u@@ able objec@@ ts ... which would risk to exc@@ ite the gre@@ ed of certain pu@@ p@@ ils ... towards their more fortun@@ ate pe@@ ers .
i thought it might be you .
i 'm not in the ha@@ bit of spo@@ iling children with gif@@ ts of this value .
- may i see olivier ? - by all means . i 've already sent for him .
he 's waiting in the vest@@ i@@ bul@@ e .
come in , olivier .
i leave you together .
good day , aunt . who sent you this pen ?
i ...
i don 't know , aunt .
don 't lie to me , olivier .
it could only have come from him .
have the courage to tell me the truth .
yes .
it is a gift from monsieur pri@@ vat .
i will send it back . you must never accept anything from this man .
but why not , aunt ?
you 're too young to know about these things .
but i need to know !
since you put it like that , i 'll tell you .
one day , in dec@@ ember of 1917 , the war was still rag@@ ing ,
pri@@ vat came to my home where your parents were staying and fired his gun .
- he wanted to kill them , olivier .
i don 't believe you . why was my mother in@@ tent on living with him ?
i 'm still trying to figure that out . your mother and i never saw eye to eye on many things .
why didn 't you tell me so@@ oner ?
i didn 't want you to get upset .
i hope we never have to discus@@ s this matter ever again .
anyway , so@@ oner or later , you would have found out .
enter .
of course you will .
because you are pure .
wild child .
street child .
- please stop glo@@ ating at my ex@@ pense ! - you see , she dropped me . who did ?
this milit@@ ant girl who wrote these pa@@ the@@ tic lines .
i 'm down to listening to this music for rej@@ ec@@ ted lo@@ vers .
all around me ,
" everything is order and beauty . "
and yet , my pain is real . why ?
mar@@ ceau ...
you knew about ... about my parents and pri@@ vat ?
what are you talking about ?
well ...
the time pri@@ vat ... the time he came here .
your mother told me the story . the divine finally cou@@ gh@@ ed it up ?
yes .
pri@@ vat fired sho@@ ts at them .
in fact , it happened right here .
in this very room where your parents stayed . i was only 2 at the time .
but look .
look at the mirror .
imp@@ acts left by the bul@@ lets .
see where love can lead ?
a few centi@@ met@@ ers to the side ... and you 'd never have been born , my little out@@ cast .
but rest assu@@ red ,
why didn 't you tell me ?
because this story is bor@@ ing as hell , my friend .
two grown men love the same woman . an ordin@@ ary drama based on je@@ alo@@ us@@ y .
you 're mama was nothing more than a smal@@ l-@@ time god@@ dess , as my mother put it .
come on , che@@ er up .
i don 't want to see you suff@@ er , my little angel . please spar@@ e me your expres@@ sions of gran@@ deur !
we are both in@@ ju@@ red and abandon@@ ed soul@@ s .
like two star@@ lings fallen from the nest .
yes ?
m. mar@@ ceau , a girl is asking for you .
- a girl ? - ml@@ le charlotte dal@@ et . charlotte ?
have her come in , quick !
a woman leaves me , i find another . - who is she ?
- the nurse from the sanat@@ orium . - the one who ...
- who taught me how to love . - you know what you have to do ?
- change wards .
- good day , mar@@ ceau .
- charlotte ! what a joy to see you again !
i 'll give you some priv@@ acy .
stop it , mar@@ ceau .
so , if i can 't kiss you , what br@@ ings you to paris ?
i shouldn 't be telling you this , but i don 't want to dece@@ ive you .
the director will be sending a letter to your parents .
a letter ?
whatever for ? you 're having a serious rel@@ ap@@ se , mar@@ ceau .
the lab you visit for your rout@@ ine chec@@ k-@@ up@@ s ... has sent us the resul@@ ts of your samp@@ les .
the samp@@ les indic@@ ate you are once again infec@@ ted .
but you said i had been cu@@ red .
the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ thor@@ ax was extre@@ mely effec@@ tive .
but when it comes to tubercul@@ osis , you can never be sure . i must go back to the sanat@@ orium ?
i 'm afraid so .
upon your release , you regi@@ ster@@ ed less than 1000 bk .
but today , you must be well over 100.000 ! it 's a serious rel@@ ap@@ se .
you must start a new treat@@ ment .
worst of all , you could have infec@@ ted your entire family .
i understand why you wouldn 't let me kiss you .
how conven@@ ient for you .
you can work on my case .
i 'll be once again your little patient . i 'll be there with you .
every hour , every second ! - you have no right to say that !
even if the truth is pain@@ ful to hear . so there , goodbye !
are we e@@ aves@@ dropping , now ?
i 'm expecting a love letter .
- you 're at that age !
- see you .
well , well . a letter for olivier .
it 's from america .
nothing for me .
i am glo@@ om , the gri@@ ev@@ ing in@@ consol@@ able wid@@ o@@ wer .
" the prince of aquitaine at the for@@ sak@@ en tower ! "
mar@@ ceau the early bird .
- i hope you 're not ill , at least .
of course not , mother .
i feel great !
what 's with him this morning ?
he must be in love , madame .
good for him .
but not a word about this to jul@@ ienne .
get up , laz@@ y@@ - bones !
even though we 're on vac@@ ation , we don 't get up any later .
america ?
thank you , marguerite .
it 's from david .
he must have quite a few stories to share !
there are tons of post@@ cards !
- sky@@ scrap@@ ers ! - and even photos .
show me .
the mail has arrived ?
obviously , because you received your letter .
- but , mar@@ ceau ?
- monsieur mar@@ ceau ?
you 're not going to read your letter ?
- did he get mail this morning ?
- no .
he was so disap@@ pointed his new swe@@ ethe@@ art hadn 't written to him .
what are you doing ?
i 'm deposit@@ ing the 2@@ nd mail bat@@ ch , as i always do at noon .
there is a 2@@ nd mail run ?
of course . this is paris !
since you 're going back to college i ad@@ vise you to take a bal@@ zac .
it will take you all week to read " les il@@ lus@@ ions per@@ dues . "
or even " la cous@@ ine b@@ ette . "
good morning , father .
i just received a letter that concer@@ ns you . really ?
you know what it might be about ? no , i can 't think of anything . you know , this american friend i wrote to ... ?
well , he agreed .
he would be happy to have you stay with him for as long as you wish .
i can now confir@@ m your travel arrang@@ ements .
you will embar@@ k on the de grace , on the morning of dec@@ ember 16 .
- happy ? - you bet !
your mother and i are sad you won 't spend christmas with us .
but more important , we want you to be happy . you 'll see , mr. de@@ wil@@ de will make good company .
what does he do for a living ? he o@@ wns a few movie theat@@ ers in new york .
they call them nick@@ elo@@ de@@ ons .
ah yes , the penny cinema .
here 's one ... a letter from the sanat@@ orium .
i have a hun@@ ch i know what it 's about .
it 's what i thought .
well they 've got some ner@@ ve !
they 're claim@@ ing reim@@ bur@@ sement for a window pan@@ e i broke by accident .
medical services are already expen@@ sive . they should cover that .
i 'll call the director immediately .
hello , ma@@ demo@@ is@@ elle ?
get me number 16 at st - pierre - les
- bains , haute - loire .
mar@@ ceau des@@ rous@@ seau speaking .
i 'd like to speak to the director , please . thank you .
i beg you , mar@@ ceau , be diplomat@@ ic .
take the receiv@@ er .
and learn from the master .
hello ? mister director ?
yes :
no , not very well .
my parents just received a letter from your ac@@ coun@@ ting department .
it claim@@ s reim@@ bur@@ sement of a window pan@@ e i accident@@ ally broke .
it was a mistake ?
i 'm happy to hear it .
i will let you take care of it .
thank you , mister director .
give my best to madame .
goodbye . you had g@@ all .
yes , you went straight to the point !
from now on , i will have you deal directly with my credit@@ ors .
with pleasure , father .
monsieur is served .
you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau .
vo@@ ila .
tell me what you think .
" concer@@ ning the state of health of our son .
" in a sanat@@ orium close to paris .
" as soon as we can , we will in@@ form you of the ...
" address of this estab@@ l@@ ishment ,
" so that you may share with them our son 's medical records .
" yours truly ... " etc .
pretty good , right ? you 're out of your mind , mar@@ ceau .
you can 't do that .
charlotte said it would be suicide .
charlotte says that to keep me in the sanat@@ orium . as you can see , i 'm in good health .
that 's not true , mar@@ ceau . even yesterday i could hear you cou@@ gh@@ ing .
excuse me .
i must mail this at once .
stand up !
stand up ! compan@@ ions in mis@@ ery .
- what 's going on , olivier ?
- i want you to stay out of this . - you 'll be able to go back ...
- once you 're back to health .
- nothing could be more un@@ certain .
so i would pre@@ fer being over@@ se@@ as .
i would rather die at the cot@@ ton club instead of the as@@ y@@ lum .
you won 't say a word about it to my parents .
you promised .
yes , but i didn 't know just how serious this is .
not to say the number of people you can contamin@@ ate .
i will tell them everything . if you do , i 'll tell them of your ou@@ ting to m@@ ado .
they 'll send you to your grand@@ pa 's to become a black@@ smith 's apprent@@ ice .
you 're such a bastard .
i don 't give a damn ! - i don 't want you to die , you understand ?
- i think you just want me to stay here .
you wouldn 't have the balls .
just wait and see .
- who is it ? - it 's me , olivier .
come in .
something really serious .
well , what is it ?
it 's , hm ...
i 'm sorry i didn 't make it to the cir@@ cus on my birthday .
that 's it ?
you scared me . it was quickly forgotten , olivier .
i forgive you , of course .
you must get up early tomorrow . the holid@@ ays are over .
yes , aunt .
such a strange boy .
ah ! if he had mar@@ ceau 's education !
if mar@@ ceau had his state of health !
- so that 's it . you 're going to play me like a viol@@ in , now ?
really , you 're not spar@@ ing me anything .
you think i 'm going to roll over like a dog ? " don 't go , i 'll sp@@ ill the be@@ ans "
you 're totally wrong .
here , you forgot you ber@@ et .
you 'll be back within the hour .
you read too much " without family . "
you should refle@@ ct on the difference between liter@@ ature and reality .
- far@@ e@@ well , mar@@ ceau .
wake up , olivier . it 's time !
it 's 7 o '@@ clock .
but ...
olivier ?
- you haven 't seen him ? - no .
not this morning . yes .
he told me he had to leave to review his latin .
i helped him till past midnight .
he was probably in@@ tent on leaving without wak@@ ing me .
i came to tell you he 's ill .
a simple phone call would have suff@@ ic@@ ed .
i have fond memories of this place .
i didn 't want to miss the opportunity .
as for your cousin , i hope it 's nothing serious .
i was their family physic@@ ian in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
yes of course , mont@@ mar@@ tre .
hey ! guys !
they should count their forts .
we should have some enem@@ ies .
we were once at peace , but everybody got confused .
hey ! wait for me .
you 're not fighting anymore with the rif@@ fr@@ af@@ f of bachel@@ et st. ?
that 's ancient history !
let 's go , i 'm star@@ ved . see you ! see you cap@@ de@@ ver@@ re .
i 'm hungry too .
see you later ! see you , lo@@ ul@@ ou .
don 't you look d@@ apper in those god awful pants !
so long .
i need some gru@@ b too .
so long , r@@ iri .
bou@@ gr@@ as !
m '@@ sieur bou@@ gr@@ as !
- where to ? - i have no idea .
if you see him again , tell him ... he ran a pig@@ st@@ y in here .
it re@@ ek@@ ed as hell !
no problem , young man .
they 're in a rush and i 'm under the gun .
- jean is fine ?
- not so bad . - did he find work ?
- yes .
yes . and how is the baby ?
- leg of lam@@ b " so@@ is@@ sons . "
- coming up . - you were saying ?
- you 're baby , how 's he doing ? an apple pu@@ d@@ ding with leg of lam@@ b " so@@ is@@ sons . "
bon appe@@ tit .
the baby ?
he 's ador@@ able .
he 's with mrs. hac@@ que .
she 's baby@@ sitting . go see him !
will do , elo@@ die .
so long , elo@@ die .
g@@ laz@@ ier !
he 's a bit like your cousin .
isn 't he the cut@@ est ?
i often take care of him .
poor elo@@ die never stop@@ s .
and with jean without a steady job , and he likes to drink a bit .
in the end , you did well to leave .
- but i was forced to leave !
- well , you know what i mean .
you were such a ho@@ ol@@ igan !
your aunt and uncle ... do they treat you well ?
yes , madame hac@@ que .
in retro@@ sp@@ ect , your mother 's death ...
i wouldn 't say it was a lucky break , far from it , mo@@ thers are ir@@ re@@ pl@@ ace@@ able .
but for your future ...
often we say : a bles@@ sing in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
ah , here comes elo@@ die .
it 's me , my little tre@@ asure !
my love , it 's your mama .
i came to tell you i won 't be off work until 2 : 30@@ pm .
he 's a real cak@@ e@@ walk your little cher@@ ub .
you gave me a hell of a scar@@ e my little angel .
that 's too easy .
you 're a bastard , mar@@ ceau .
you think you can just die off like that ?
do whatever you like with your life ?
didn 't you think about the others ?
your parents ? jul@@ ienne ?
me ?
what will become of me if you ... if you die ? now , now .
don 't worry so much .
that 's enough .
you want me to say you 're right .
is that it ? i have given it some thought .
i decided i 'll talk to my parents .
you 're lying . hang on , my doub@@ ting thomas .
you want my pas@@ sport ?
they 're yours .
without them , i can 't go . it 's a trick .
you 'll only take them back !
what else do you need , then ?
- give it to me .
- it 's a trick !
i 'll show you a trick .
so , little out@@ cast ?
happy now ?
dear olivier ,
the lands@@ cape hasn 't changed much in the last 6 months .
bore@@ dom here has reached a new philosoph@@ ical dimension .
luc@@ kil@@ y , the pain from the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ thor@@ ax ke@@ eps me awake .
i 'm so ja@@ ded that seeing your face again would bring back my spir@@ its .
and so , if you can , please come .
the sanat@@ orium is near sau@@ gues . find a way to get sent away to live with your grand@@ pa .
i wait for you , my ol@@ ive , without fa@@ il . - mar@@ ceau
this morning , there@@ fore , the supervis@@ or found olivier 's scar@@ f in the yard .
yes , and what of it ?
it was found at the bottom of the gar@@ dener 's lad@@ der ... which was leaning against the school wall , ost@@ en@@ sibly in order to jump over to the other side .
fur@@ ther@@ more , in doing olivier 's bed , the chamber@@ ma@@ id found this .
i jud@@ ged it would be best to no@@ tif@@ y you before talking to olivier .
you don 't think that olivier ... mister director , i know him . i can 't imagine him doing such a thing .
and yet , the evidence is obvious . i 'd say a little too obvious .
do you believe , mister director , that a student jum@@ ping the wall would leave the lad@@ der behind ?
more@@ over his scar@@ f be@@ aring his name ?
or keeping such comprom@@ ising evidence in the dor@@ mit@@ ory ?
i would rather think he was the target of a pr@@ ank .
a very bad scho@@ ol@@ boy pr@@ ank . i think my husband is correct in his as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment , mister director .
our neph@@ ew knows what fate would a@@ wait him should he do such a thing .
we would send him off to his grand@@ parents , in auverg@@ ne .
you 're probably right .
i should have known better . if one of our students was bent on tar@@ n@@ ishing the image of your neph@@ ew , rest assu@@ red he will be pun@@ ished accor@@ d@@ ingly .
i will deal with this matter immediately .
what happened in 1685 ?
dele@@ pine ! the assassin@@ ation of henri iv by rav@@ ail@@ lac , monsieur .
he would have been migh@@ ty , this rav@@ ail@@ lac , to assassin@@ ate a king who had been dead for 75 years !
yes , sus@@ se !
1685 , re@@ voc@@ ation of the edi@@ ct of nantes by louis xiv , sir .
well done . now , what happened in ...
be se@@ ated , children .
i 'm here to discus@@ s a serious matter .
it would appear that one of you ... wanted to get chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f acc@@ used of jum@@ ping the wall .
his scar@@ f was left behind in the yard as evidence ... and other objec@@ ts i won 't mention at this time , were plant@@ ed in his personal belong@@ ings in the dor@@ mit@@ ory .
perhaps it was only meant as a stupid pr@@ ank . but i would sum@@ mon the guilty party to come forth in this instant , otherwise i will have to take me@@ as@@ ures against the entire class .
" a fault confes@@ sed is half re@@ dressed . " gentlem@@ en !
i 'm waiting .
chate@@ aun@@ eu@@ f , you would like to speak ?
nobody played a trick on me , sir .
i did jump the wall last night .
i don 't want the entire class pun@@ ished on my account .
- and where did you go ? - to see a friend .
the gir@@ lies !
- what do you mean : " the gir@@ lies " ?
- the stre@@ et@@ wal@@ kers , sir .
olivier !
shame on you ! you 're a dis@@ grace .
i don 't want you living with us anymore .
at least you don 't look like a ho@@ ol@@ igan !
come on , let 's go .
ho , victor !
can 't this wait ?
- she 's all yours , anton@@ in . - you 're holding us up .
adi@@ os !
give it to me .
you will call me " ton@@ ton . "
and that girl ... not a word about her to gr@@ anny .
all right , ton@@ ton .
you 'll see . there isn 't much here to lift gr@@ annie 's spir@@ its .
she 's not thril@@ led with your arri@@ val .
with grand@@ pa , it 's different .
he just loves telling stories .
so he 's happy that you 're coming .
besides , since in@@ jur@@ ing his leg , he 's been bo@@ red stif@@ f .
listen , i must te@@ ach you a phrase in " pat@@ ois , " and you will repe@@ at it to him .
oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue . say it .
oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue .
we don 't have much time for you to learn it .
we 're here . there 's the " ou@@ sta@@ ou . "
- go on , say the phrase .
- oh , gust@@ ou , beni far@@ a mon@@ e@@ gue .
" allo pit@@ ch@@ ou " !
let me look at you .
you have your father 's eyes . come on in !
i prepared a sn@@ ack for you .
you must be hungry after your trip .
here were are .
over here , it 's not like at victoria 's .
it will be a lot different than my daughter 's apartment .
there . you 'll see .
we can be quite comfortable here , too . sit over here .
we 'll get you something to eat . here .
this will be your pocket knife .
you must give a coin in return .
it 's the cu@@ st@@ om .
- will this do , ton@@ ton ?
it 's not for the money .
it 's to pre@@ serve friend@@ ship .
you 're grand@@ ma isn 't here .
she 's picking mus@@ h@@ rooms .
and a bit of water , of course !
well , then ?
- how is it , good ?
- victor , where are you ?
see that door , it 's your room .
you can put your things .
will you show him how to for@@ ge ?
yes , you can watch me smith iron .
and if you 're not too tired , you can give me a hand .
see you later , ton@@ ton .
i say , you look a bit pale to me .
don 't worry , here you 'll soon get back your color .
here comes gr@@ annie .
victor didn 't war@@ n you ? she 's a bit of a gro@@ uch .
she doesn 't like kissing very much .
give grand@@ ma a hug , olivier .
careful ! dum@@ my , you 'll make the mus@@ h@@ rooms tip over .
- we 're in for a treat tonight !
- no . you 'll have to wait until sunday .
so ?
are you the little s@@ camp my daughter went crazy over ?
anyway , he 's a good boy .
and very pol@@ ite if you can believe it .
we 'll see .
he 's one of the best black@@ s@@ mi@@ ths in the country .
okay , grand@@ pa .
ah .
there you are .
- this one ?
- yes , it will st@@ ir the fire .
in 2 months , you 'll have man 's muscles !
you can stop now , olivier .
you should tour the stable and say hi to the co@@ ws .
you 'll find 3 . they 're kind .
there 's do@@ ur@@ ade , the most assu@@ red .
then , la mar@@ cade , and finally , pou@@ mer@@ ade , the one with the spo@@ ts . - where is the stable ?
- in the back .
you can go .
hello co@@ ws !
how are you ?
and you , la mar@@ cade . and you are la do@@ ur@@ ade .
how are you , pou@@ mer@@ ade ?
let me introdu@@ ce myself .
normally i live in mont@@ mar@@ tre .
what are you doing here ?
get out of here , you hear me ?
he knows what to expect , now . if that ban@@ dit ever comes near the farm again .
what is the sense of ad@@ ding mis@@ ery to mis@@ ery ?
come on , now . he provo@@ ked me , right ? i didn 't start anything .
- we must understand him . - understand him !
if you can understand a criminal , you can understand me as well .
if he ever comes close to the l@@ ad he knows what to expect .
i thought your god was the god of for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess .
leave my god alone ! i 'm taking the animals to the fields .
make sure the boy doesn 't leave the farm un@@ ac@@ compan@@ ied .
why not ? he 's not in prison , here .
you read what victoria wrote in her letter :
you must never leave that little sco@@ und@@ rel out of your sight !
you 'd think victoria makes the rules in my home !
could you please call " pit@@ ch@@ ou " ?
olivier ! go see your grand@@ father .
right , read me that article .
" the nazi party stat@@ ed that the german@@ s have ral@@ lied in great numbers ...
" by adolf hitler to burn all books de@@ em@@ ed sub@@ ver@@ sive ...
" and dec@@ ad@@ ent in the public square .
" several million books were reduc@@ ed to ash@@ es on the morning of may 5 . "
you see , olivier , when the world 's train leaves its tracks , no one knows where it will stop .
why would anyone want to burn books ?
they bring no harm . they don 't want people to think ! they 're being gro@@ omed to be like machines .
but tell me , you read very well , how can you be doing so po@@ or@@ ly in class , at least according to your aunt victoria ?
- i don 't know , grand@@ pa . - you don 't know ...
fur@@ ther@@ more , it seems you sne@@ ak out of the college at night . you 're a real es@@ coul@@ as !
in our family we always had rebel@@ s .
look at me : i 'm the only red in this country of wh@@ ites !
say , grand@@ pa ?
yes ?
the sanat@@ orium where mar@@ ceau is staying , it 's in this region , right ?
i say , you go straight to the point .
you 've been here less than a day and already you want to go to the sanat@@ orium .
tell me , did you come here to see mar@@ ceau ?
- yes , grand@@ pa . - it 's good to tell the truth . but ...
victoria was very clear that under no circum@@ stance ... you were to go to the sanat@@ orium .
but why would she object ?
she must have her reasons . you see , we 're al@@ ike .
you think so ?
and why is that ?
because i want to see mar@@ ceau too ! i really miss my grand@@ son .
he grew up here .
always running after girls in the hills , and f@@ ishing for tr@@ out or cr@@ ay@@ fish .
we had some great times , him and me .
but now , it only hur@@ ts to know he 's there .
the doctor told me i couldn 't go , that i could catch his ill@@ ness .
but mark my words :
we 're going to see him together ! - really ? - as real as i am an es@@ coul@@ as .
i looked at the map , it 's about 50 km .
we 're not going to take the road .
the mountain tra@@ ils will save us at least 10 km .
we 'll take a horse and bug@@ gy , and i 'll tell them i 'm taking you to the animal fair in lan@@ ge@@ ac .
will they let us go ?
they 'll say i 'm crazy . but i 'm head of this family . - i can do what i want , right ?
- yes , grand@@ pa ! hold on .
don 't get your spir@@ its too high .
i need to know if you can keep a secret .
with victor and gr@@ annie , you have to act a bit , show them you 're not really thril@@ led about coming with me .
- right . - good .
we shouldn 't aro@@ use their sus@@ pic@@ ions .
we 'll leave sunday at dawn .
but until then ...
that means we won 't arrive before night@@ fall . they 'll figure out we didn 't go to lan@@ ge@@ ac .
so what ?
once i 've seen mar@@ ceau , they can think what they want .
i don 't care .
at least we 're lucky , the weather 's on our side .
hope@@ fully we won 't get caught in the storm before we reach the pass .
let 's go , n@@ ono . let 's go !
that 's it , grand@@ pa !
- i gave him some o@@ ats . - that 's good .
- here .
let 's have a little fe@@ ast !
some ham , bread and wine .
that 's my holy trin@@ ity .
you see , whatever victoria might think ,
i wouldn 't trade a single tree from these mountains ... for all the lights in paris .
say , grand@@ pa ? why doesn 't gr@@ annie like being kissed ? you must understand her .
she lost 2 children .
that made her a little col@@ der .
if you had known her when she was in her 20@@ s , she was beautiful . a real ey@@ e-@@ po@@ pper .
you know , for our marriage , we under@@ took the white stick cerem@@ ony .
the white stick cerem@@ ony ?
what 's that ? if the fi@@ an@@ cee placed a bro@@ om on its fli@@ p-@@ side against her door , it meant she didn 't want you .
- that is so funny .
- you think so ? damn it ! i didn 't sleep all night .
but the next morning , gr@@ annie had turned all the bro@@ oms on the farm on the right side .
and even the fil@@ thy ones .
if only she could hear me !
at the time , she just loved cl@@ inging to my arm as we dan@@ ced .
what are you w@@ ishing for , young moun@@ tain@@ eer ? what did you hope to acqu@@ ire if you are un@@ willing to dance ?
que vol@@ io cerca , jo@@ vo de la montag@@ na ?
que vol@@ io cerca , si vol@@ io pas dan@@ ser ? if you didn 't want to dance , you should not have come .
a@@ ie ! grand@@ pa !
- i trip@@ ped , olivier .
- come , come . come , it 's nothing .
it 's nothing .
just give me a hand .
serv@@ es me right for playing the young man .
there .
i 'm breathing better and i 'll be alright .
we still have ... 2 km u@@ ph@@ ill .
the road will be easier after that .
and what if it 's m '@@ sieur pri@@ vat ?
we 'll say hi anyway .
- but he tried to kill my parents !
- so what ? you don 't fire a gun at people without a reason .
have you ever asked yourself why he did that ?
grand@@ pa ! it 's uncle victor .
that 's a different matter .
- you think i don 't see through this ?
you 'll never get to the sanat@@ orium before night@@ fall .
it 's mad@@ ness . what do you mean ?
is it mad@@ ness to want to see my grand@@ son ?
- you 're the one that 's crazy !
- i might be crazy ... but you 're turning around and i come with you .
and you , olivier , don 't try that again or i 'll b@@ ust your ass .
and not a word to your grand@@ ma , she 'll gou@@ ge your eyes out .
i bought a 6 lb ham at fay@@ et 's .
let 's go .
you see , the word sol@@ itude , it only takes one " l " .
because it 's all alone , you see !
you didn 't con@@ jug@@ ate correc@@ tly the past tense of the ver@@ b " shoot . "
tell me why ! because it 's an exception . it 's an ir@@ regular ver@@ b .
then why couldn 't you get that right ? i forgot .
on top of that you mis@@ sp@@ el@@ led the proper name of the ban@@ dit .
if you work hard , you 'll soon become an ace .
but ... when you go back to school , you 'll have to go back to paris .
- but , grand@@ pa ... - it 's sad to say , but no@@ wad@@ ays , the future of youth lies within the cities .
it break@@ s my heart to say it because , as you know , i would love it if you could stay here with me .
i would love to stay here with you too . don 't be silly !
after a few months , you 'd get bo@@ red .
no . i 'm happy , here .
i 'm happy like ... - like ...
- like with your mother ?
so much the better .
you should join your gr@@ annie out in the fields .
today , she 's at devil 's ab@@ y@@ ss .
you know where that is ?
what will gr@@ annie say ? you 'll soon find out .
don 't forget to gre@@ et the fol@@ ks you en@@ counter .
here people talk to each other .
" par@@ le@@ z-@@ moi d '@@ amour
" re@@ dit@@ es-@@ moi des choses ten@@ dres
" vo@@ tre beau discours ... " mon co@@ eur n '@@ est pas las de l '@@ ent@@ endre
besides , you wanted to kill my parents !
you said my father was your friend and that my mother loved you !
but you fired a gun at them .
that 's why you went to ja@@ il !
it 's your aunt who told you that ?
let me tell you what happened .
i don 't want to hear it .
leave me alone !
what are you up to , olivier ?
you came directly ?
no , i swear it , gr@@ annie .
- did you meet anyone on the way ? - no .
actually , yes . i saw lou@@ ison flan@@ din .
he asked me to go to a soccer game with him .
- i told him i was coming to see you .
- very well , then .
good . well , i 'm off to see the co@@ ws .
what are you doing ?
you can tell you 're from paris !
co@@ ws don 't care for sugar . they like salt !
give the sugar to the dog .
it 's not good for his eyes , but over here , we don 't let anything go to waste .
here , dog@@ gy , come boy .
good , huh ? that 's good .
how can you tell when it 's time to go back to the farm , then ?
look at the shadow cast by the shed .
when it re@@ aches the boul@@ der , it 's time to bring the co@@ ws home .
looks like you have a heat stroke . go fresh@@ en up at the river .
- the river looks pretty deep .
- " devil 's ab@@ y@@ ss " ?
- a long time ago , there was a man who brag@@ ged about not belie@@ ving in either god or devil .
well , the poor bastard got his pun@@ ishment .
the river swallowed him .
- really ? - obviously ! he made a point to come and work here on the lord 's day .
one stor@@ my day , as he was driving his car@@ t along the banks , he surely came too close to the preci@@ p@@ ice .
then the two hands of the devil lung@@ ed from the river , his long cla@@ ws gras@@ ped him fier@@ cel@@ y so he couldn 't move , and down he went to the bottom with his two horses !
- that 's not true . it 's a legend . - you 're like your grand@@ father .
climb up on the rock ... and bend over the preci@@ p@@ ice .
you 'll see the re@@ mains of the car@@ t at the bottom !
- see it ?
- not sure .
the water isn 't clear .
look again !
ah yes ! i see it .
i see the car@@ t with bones and a skel@@ eton !
did you notice , gr@@ annie ?
the shadow has set on the boul@@ der .
well done , you 're a fast lear@@ ner .
soon , you 'll be able to lead the co@@ ws to the past@@ ure all by yourself .
if you like . here .
take my stick and lead them toward the trail .
go on ! we 'll see how well you do .
come on co@@ ws ! let 's go .
where are you going , pou@@ mer@@ ade ?
it 's pretty obvious you pe@@ aled chun@@ ks off her ho@@ of .
i 'm not s@@ elling her to you . ( speaking pat@@ ois )
pat@@ ois with a paris@@ ian accent . very com@@ ical .
he 's making progress in this area too !
- olivier ! it 's great that you can now smith , but you can 't ne@@ gle@@ ct your studies .
wait !
we 're not done yet .
an automobile !
she did well for herself , our victoria .
that 's for sure .
she went to paris and paris went to her head .
she 's as@@ ham@@ ed of us .
she avo@@ ids telling her friends that we are black@@ s@@ mi@@ ths . instead , she says we 're iron@@ work artist@@ s .
i think being a black@@ smith is a more noble trade .
you plan to stay with us ?
no , no . i came in like the wind , just to drop off jul@@ ienne .
i thought you dropped in to say hi .
that too , of course .
my god ; this heat ! tell me ,
mar@@ ceau , my grand@@ son .
how 's he doing ?
his condition is stable the doc@@ tors tell me .
but they may have to per@@ form a thor@@ aco .
- a thor@@ aco@@ plast@@ y .
it 's an operation consist@@ ing of com@@ pressing the dis@@ eas@@ ed lung by re@@ moving some ri@@ bs .
- in his case , 6 .
- that 's terrible !
- are you going back ? - no .
he 's asked us to leave .
one-@@ eyed bitch !
i would give both my legs if it could bring him back to health .
children should not have to suff@@ er . and how is your leg doing ?
a bit of pain , that 's all .
the real bur@@ den is in@@ action . lucky for me , i have olivier .
- he seems well ac@@ clim@@ at@@ ised . - yes .
he 's very happy , here .
but you must take him back to paris .
oh no .
that 's out of the question !
victoria !
i am your father . this is my home . i 'm in charge .
and you 'll listen to me , for god 's sake !
i worked with him almost every day .
he 's a very bright boy .
he 's in@@ quis@@ itive , devo@@ urs books .
with a bit of help , he 'll become someone .
he must be allowed to further his studies .
you have no right to con@@ dem@@ n him to ignor@@ ance .
sometimes i wonder if perhaps i wasn 't too hard on him .
well , speak of the devil . - good day , aunt .
- i am happy to see you again .
- lik@@ e@@ wise , aunt .
your grand@@ father tells me you like it here .
yes , aunt .
you know what would make him happy ?
- going up to see mar@@ ceau .
- that won 't happen .
it 's true ! show her the letter .
your aunt was clear : he doesn 't want to see anyone .
he 's was cruel toward me , this morning .
- i 'm sure he 'll want to see me .
- listen ,
victoria , it would do mar@@ ceau a lot of good !
well .
if you 're ready in 5 minutes , i 'll drop you off at the sanat@@ orium .
there is an evening coach .
- thank you , aunt . - remember : 5 minutes ! - i 'll be ready .
- hey !
olivier , before you go , drink a bit of wine and che@@ w on some gar@@ li@@ c .
it will give you strength .
and rep@@ el evil .
guillaume , please ! stop the car at the next cur@@ ve .
mar@@ ceau is lost , olivier .
the doc@@ tors will attempt an operation but gave me little hope .
you must not tell anyone . do you understand ?
- i swear , aunt . ah !
my god .
it 's not fair !
he suff@@ ers immen@@ sely .
you 'll see , he 's changed .
but he must@@ n 't find out .
anyway , who knows .
perhaps there is still a chance .
i 'm sure of it , my aunt .
i 'm sure of it .
i don 't have the courage .
he 's inside that building .
room 18 . second floor .
you 'll have to sne@@ ak in , children are not allowed .
don 't worry .
thank you , aunt .
i know you . you 're his cousin .
you can 't stay here . he 's not in his room .
he 's outside , in the sol@@ arium .
- go on !
- thanks .
- it 's you , my little out@@ cast .
i knew you would come .
- how did you get here ? - your mother brought me .
you see , the divine isn 't that bad .
have a seat .
by the way , bravo for the st@@ unt you pulled at the college .
your letter cracked me up . a work of art !
how are you feeling ?
i hope you didn 't come for a medical report .
it bo@@ ils down to one word : ir@@ reco@@ ver@@ able .
that 's not true .
after your operation , things will im@@ prove .
that 's right ...
hope that everything will go well after losing half your ri@@ bs !
i must admit , i 'm a little pes@@ sim@@ ist@@ ic .
you see , olivier .
i would have prefer@@ red dying in new york .
or on the bridge of a tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic .
much better than here , don 't you think ?
olivier , i beg you .
you remember ... ?
the concert by louis armstrong ?
we share so many memories you and i .
we do indeed !
grand@@ pa em@@ brac@@ es you warm@@ ly .
tell him i 'm doing well .
how is he ?
his leg still hur@@ ts .
you know , we almost succe@@ eded to come see you .
- we were forced to turn back , though .
- dar@@ n es@@ coul@@ as , hasn 't changed a bit .
well , here comes my guardian angel .
as you can see , i have nothing to compl@@ ain about .
i was ru@@ de with jul@@ ienne this morning .
i would like you to watch over her . exten@@ d her the love i was incap@@ able of giving her .
okay ? - do you promise ?
- i promise , mar@@ ceau .
alright , time to go .
and please ...
- don 't come back to see me .
- why ? - please .
- you can 't stay , olivier .
i told you already .
children are not allowed .
don 't be angry with him .
you 'll see , you 'll like it up here .
this is the best mat@@ t@@ ress ever .
so put your mind at rest .
have you seen these old books ?
" le tour de la france by two children . "
- of course it 's good . with that i learned to read to my wife .
- may i open it ?
look at this beautiful med@@ al .
it was your father 's . with palms .
and what 's this ?
belong@@ s to my daughter .
- aunt victoria ?
- yes .
long ago , with only an orange , you could celebr@@ ate christmas eve .
oh yes ! back then , we didn 't have the lux@@ ury of going ... to the hospital in a car@@ riage .
life was really har@@ sh ... and money was hard to come by . we would fight over it .
have you seen this funny boot ?
all blo@@ ated and with an enor@@ mous sol@@ e .
that sho@@ e belong@@ ed to your dad .
you see , we send boys to their death before they can experience life .
your poor father .
when he came back to this country , after he was in@@ ju@@ red ,
i didn 't recognize him . all i could say was : " there you are . "
he we@@ pt .
he walked between two cr@@ ut@@ ches , still bor@@ e shr@@ ap@@ nel in his skin ,
his lungs bur@@ nt by the gas .
to think he was once as swift as a squir@@ rel , only to stag@@ ger into a cloud .
he would raise his eyes , as if to prepare an answer , but he said nothing .
your mother re@@ sto@@ red his taste for life .
just enough time to make a little darling .
and now he 's gone .
i can 't sleep .
mar@@ ceau is always on my mind .
it is so un@@ fair .
we were planning on getting married .
i would do anything for him to be cu@@ red .
don 't worry .
soon , he 'll be well again .
he told me that even if he was to reco@@ ver , he would no longer marry me .
he said that only because he doesn 't want to leave you with any reg@@ re@@ ts . - you think so ?
- i 'm sure .
this ill@@ ness has really changed him .
besides , there 's this other girl , the nurse .
don 't cry , jul@@ ienne . don 't .
you know , he doesn 't really care about charlotte .
- i don 't know .
i don 't know anymore . - it 's true !
he told me .
don 't worry .
kiss me , olivier .
not like that , you idiot .
mar@@ ceau !
- not really , no .
i think i 'll go back to paris .
i thought you were going to stay here a few days .
i 'm too close to mar@@ ceau , here .
victor ?
would you mind taking me to the station ?
i 'm really busy with work , you know . olivier could take you .
he can ste@@ er a bug@@ gy .
you must not lo@@ iter on the way .
you will come home right after .
- you know , i can go by myself . - no .
a young girl should never travel alone .
he 's right .
by the way , the other day in lan@@ ge@@ ac , i saw a used wi@@ re@@ less .
- for a good price . - no music in my house !
why not ?
- a bit of music , here and there .
- no , no .
nov@@ el@@ ties are bear@@ ers of mis@@ fortune .
it seems you like to d@@ well in it .
you don 't want water spr@@ inging from a p@@ ipe , so you carry a bu@@ cket .
you don 't want music that could up@@ lift our spir@@ its .
you can 't live in the past or among the dead forever , mother .
i can live with mine , thank you .
line 24 , arri@@ ving from pu@@ y-@@ en-@@ vel@@ ay , en route to paris via cler@@ mont-@@ ferr@@ and , immedi@@ ate depar@@ ture , platform 1 .
it was sweet of you to ac@@ company me , olivier .
we 'll meet again in paris , some day ?
victor was right , it 's a p@@ ity you are leaving .
- we were happy together .
- you 're a swe@@ eti@@ e . - mar@@ ceau asked me to watch over you .
- and you 've succe@@ eded nic@@ ely .
are you crazy , you little per@@ vert !
- what 's the matter ? the other night ... - quiet !
war@@ m-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , just like your mother .
- you have no right to say that !
- oh yeah ?
how do you call a woman who had lo@@ vers ?
none of your business .
she did as she pleased .
victoria said your mother was a smal@@ l-@@ time god@@ dess .
it 's not her fault if pri@@ vat tried to shoot her .
not her fault ? well there 's a good one !
why do you say that ?
my poor olivier !
if you only knew what your mother did to pri@@ vat .
what did she do to him ?
- tell me , jul@@ ienne ! - i can 't tell you .
attention , now depar@@ ting .
go and see pri@@ vat .
he lives on a big estate called les br@@ uy@@ eres .
he 'll tell you what really happened .
we 'll meet again .
later .
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
come on , faster !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
hue , n@@ ono !
easy , easy , n@@ ono .
w@@ hoa !
i 'd like to speak to mr. pri@@ vat .
it 's very important . yes , i see .
he shouldn 't be long .
you can wait in the living room .
follow me .
it 's your mother , olivier .
a friend of mine made that b@@ ust .
she was about to turn 18 .
i thought you wouldn 't want to see me again .
i didn 't come for you .
i need to know something .
- it 's very important .
- i 'm listening .
why did you want to kill my parents .
what did they do to you ?
i was your ... your mother 's first husband . my mother 's first husband ?
your mother couldn 't bring herself to tell you she was divor@@ ced . she didn 't want you trou@@ bled by that .
we got married before the war .
we were living together and then i was called to the front .
at the same time your father was .
we were chil@@ d@@ hood friends , all three of us .
when he got in@@ ju@@ red , in octo@@ ber of 1914 , and was released from duty , your mother took care of him .
i thought they met when father came back wo@@ unded from the war ? no . no .
but your mother was indeed his nurse .
months and years went by .
then one day , i received a dis@@ hear@@ tening letter ... from your mother . she was leaving for paris , with your father .
- it 's not true .
you 're lying ! - no .
you 'll be the only one to know the truth .
a truth i have never reve@@ aled . to anyone .
upon reading the letter , i was shat@@ tered , for@@ lor@@ n .
i wanted to find your mother .
in the spring of 1917 , during general niv@@ ell 's offen@@ sives ,
i had volun@@ te@@ ered to per@@ form inspec@@ tions on a fort we had re@@ taken .
i picked up a gren@@ ade , un@@ pin@@ ned it , then i pushed my arm through a gun sli@@ t ,
and held it until my arm blew off .
that 's how i became a war hero .
weeks later , i left the hospital and headed for paris .
with the in@@ tent of killing your parents , and turning the gun on myself . there it is .
olivier !
- i hope you 'll forgive me .
- my parents would never have done that !
it 's not their fault , olivier . it 's the war that created this mess .
this can 't be true .
i will never forgive them !
they 're no longer my mother nor my father !
you have no right to judge them !
you 'll understand this later on .
it is possible to love ... and then no longer love .
we 're not masters ...
- shut up !
olivier !
move on , n@@ ono ! move on !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
gi@@ d@@ dy@@ -up !
olivier ! charlotte ?
what 's going on ? it 's mar@@ ceau ?
mar@@ ceau ?
no . don 't worry .
he 's over there , in the car .
how is he ?
they wouldn 't let him go out , but he persu@@ aded the director . he wanted to see you .
they will oper@@ ate tomorrow .
you 'll see .
he 's weak@@ ened , but ke@@ eps in good spir@@ its .
so , my little out@@ cast ? - you 're now a she@@ pher@@ d ?
- you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau .
you should be resting !
but i am resting , here .
don 't say anything to your grand@@ pa ?
let him cher@@ ish the image of a young man in perfect health , rather than one of deter@@ ior@@ ation .
besides , i came for you .
i got your letter .
i needed to talk to you ..
- you didn 't have to come . - i know that .
i wanted to ask you something .
what is it ?
you must forgive your parents , olivier .
do not judge them , as i often did with mine .
since i 've been living with death , i find these jud@@ g@@ ments so lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us .
your parents loved each other and you want to hold that against them ? no .
- but look at what they did to mr. pri@@ vat !
- it 's all the same .
the love they had for each other ... and the wrong they did are 2 sides of the same med@@ al .
you can@@ not split them apart .
do you understand ?
remember , olivier .
one day , you said that my life and death wouldn 't have meaning just for me .
so now , i want you to trust me .
it 's the last time ...
you 're crazy , mar@@ ceau !
we 'll see each other after the operation !
don 't be silly .
do what i say .
promised ?
i know you 're going back to school in paris .
but before you go , i want you to visit your parents ' grave .
and tell them that you love them .
how can i tell them ?
if you put your heart into it , they 'll hear you .
really ?
yes .
i have a book on the language of flowers .
i 'll offer them a rose .
a red rose .
it 's a symbol of love .
crazy love .
bravo .
you see , when you want to .
now , now .
don 't start that again .
we 'll see each other again !
we 'll travel to america .
we 'll go che@@ er louis armstrong at the cot@@ ton club .
we 'll have a great time !
- what do you say , my ol@@ ive ?
- let 's do it !
courage , my little ur@@ chin !
you old far@@ t !
i 'm the editor of " l '@@ illu@@ stration . "
i 'm here for od@@ il@@ on hubert , the alger@@ ian mp .
he 's over there .
thank you .
mr. hubert ?
i 'm camille br@@ uy@@ ere .
as the first man to re@@ present fren@@ ch@@ men in alger@@ ia , my new@@ sp@@ aper would like to devo@@ te an article to you .
- about alger@@ ia ?
- no , about you .
about me ?
a shakespe@@ are@@ an trag@@ edy with blood and violence ?
our read@@ ers love that , sir .
is that so ?
it 's another country , young man . another world . a land of extre@@ mes .
scal@@ ding days , fre@@ ez@@ ing nights . the chok@@ ing smell of go@@ at and jas@@ mine .
let me take notes .
it 's about other religi@@ ons and pe@@ op@@ les .
it 's about arab@@ s , fan@@ at@@ ical mus@@ lim warriors who only love horses and arms .
that 's great .
how will you explain to your read@@ ers the new race of french sett@@ lers , the truly ex@@ otic mix of cor@@ sic@@ ans , people from the ro@@ uer@@ gue , the ar@@ ie@@ ge , the span@@ i@@ ards , je@@ ws and mal@@ t@@ ese ?
let 's give it a try and start at the beginning .
when did you get to alger@@ ia ?
i arrived in oran in 1837 with my friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
i was a medical officer and he was an interpre@@ ter .
alger@@ ia was a world filled with wild dreams .
everyone had their own ideas about what to do with this new@@ ly con@@ quer@@ ed land .
we 'd been fighting for 7 years .
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 1 .
the emir 's doctor
he 's the guy on the black stal@@ lion .
and i , jean-baptiste fre@@ mond , will get abd el-@@ kader !
the colonel wanted you to see the interior of alger@@ ia .
you 'll have your fill .
wait for my signal to shoot .
i 've been in the field for 3 years and i haven 't killed a single ar@@ ab yet !
if you shoot , you 'll get court marti@@ aled !
crap !
shit !
the sly old dog !
curse your mother 's religion !
let him die , doc !
take care of our wo@@ unded .
- he 's a man like you and me .
- maybe like you , not me .
you 're nai@@ ve .
you won 't live long if you keep this up .
hey interpre@@ ter , ask this guy where they spent the night .
who gave them food and shel@@ ter ?
tell him i 'll shoot him in the head if he lies .
- tem@@ ou@@ chent . - shit !
- let 's go .
- what about him ?
bring him .
i 'll show him what i 'm made of .
bre@@ te@@ uil !
dum@@ as !
shit !
sav@@ ages !
burn that damn village !
set the whole town ab@@ laz@@ e !
cut down the trees !
burn their cro@@ ps !
those br@@ utes must die !
- take them all !
- even the women ?
i said " them all , " lieutenant !
women and children too ! - why the women ?
- arab@@ s buy and sell women like cat@@ tle .
the ugly ones become slav@@ es .
they invent@@ ed raz@@ z@@ ias , lieutenant , not us .
the only thing arab@@ s respect is strength .
that 's the only thing those fan@@ at@@ ics understand .
strength .
imagine our desp@@ air .
hel@@ ie and i were saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans .
we hadn 't come to alger@@ ia for this , but to unite the east and the west like we 'd s@@ worn to do a few months earlier in paris .
you are now brothers through saint-@@ simon . apost@@ les of a new christian@@ ity .
we saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans , who follow the te@@ ach@@ ings of our master , the late count of saint-@@ simon , a re@@ mar@@ kab@@ le econom@@ ist and philosoph@@ er , want to build a new society based on progress .
engine@@ ers , poly@@ techn@@ ici@@ ans and bank@@ ers , we 'll spread our message around the world .
let 's leave for africa , for the regen@@ cy of al@@ gi@@ ers over which the french flag now f@@ lies .
let 's all swear to unite the east 's spiritu@@ al val@@ ues with the material ones of the west .
we swear !
we swear !
hello , ferdinand .
mother , you know ferdinand de les@@ se@@ ps .
mr. de les@@ se@@ ps .
he 's going to eg@@ y@@ pt with father enf@@ antin to build a canal lin@@ king the mediterran@@ ean to the red sea .
a canal ?
what ever for ?
so indi@@ a-@@ bound bo@@ ats won 't need to go around africa .
those are the per@@ eire brothers , very rich bank@@ ers .
mother , this is my friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
we 're going to alger@@ ia together .
he 's an interpre@@ ter and i 'll act as medical officer in oran .
we 'll build a new world over there , mad@@ am .
all men will be equ@@ al , reg@@ ard@@ less of race or religion .
on the barbar@@ y coast ! my god !
have a seat , mother .
excuse me .
- i don 't know that friend . - he 's a new one .
allow me to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you , mrs. hubert .
your son od@@ il@@ on is a good boy and a ze@@ alous apost@@ le of our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian cause .
- i fear for him , sir .
- why is that ?
you 're sending him to alger@@ ia , a war@@ - and chol@@ er@@ a-@@ rid@@ den land .
of course .
but it 's an excit@@ ing mission :
to wake up slum@@ ber@@ ing islam and cre@@ ate a new society .
my only son with arab@@ s !
- we 're to meet the colonel .
- he 's busy at the moment .
- we 'll wait here .
- as you wish .
did you know colonel lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere was saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian too ?
i 'm not surprised .
he went to the poly@@ technique , so he must be in favor of progress .
- goodbye , mr. ben@@ simon . - goodbye .
interpre@@ ter hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint .
medical officer , major od@@ il@@ on hubert .
at ease .
i know .
father enf@@ antin told me about your coming to alger@@ ia .
welcome to this beautiful country where much re@@ mains to be done .
follow me .
i 'll brief you .
we 're occup@@ ying the ports of al@@ gi@@ ers , bone and oran .
our only intention , at first , was to occup@@ y the co@@ ast@@ line , like the tur@@ ks .
that isn 't what we saw when we arrived , colonel .
this is clearly a war to conqu@@ er and ex@@ termin@@ ate the arab@@ s .
i know .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers wrote that we 're more barbar@@ ian than the barbar@@ ians .
they 're unfortunately right .
but whose fault is it ?
abd el-@@ kader has started a holy war against us .
he s@@ wore to throw us into the sea .
he 's wag@@ ed a v@@ ast , cruel and ru@@ th@@ less war against us .
we did inv@@ ade his land .
we 're de@@ aling with religi@@ ons fan@@ at@@ ics ! we have to domin@@ ate them , or they 'll drive us out and the british will take our place .
the french government doesn 't know what it wants .
ten gover@@ nor@@ -@@ gener@@ als in 6 years !
we don 't have enough men to end this once and for all .
barely 30,000 men vs. 3 million arab@@ s in a country 3 times the size of france .
it 's ridiculous !
yet , the saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian mission is clear :
we want to help the arab@@ s , to protect their language and their religion . we wish to let them run their own country and help them gradu@@ ally take in the val@@ ues of modern western civiliz@@ ation .
excuse me , colonel ...
how is that different from colon@@ iz@@ ation ?
the land , to@@ us@@ saint .
the land .
we need to leave it to the arab@@ s who are its righ@@ t@@ ful far@@ mers .
our role is to build fac@@ tor@@ ies , roads and rail@@ roads .
that 's why i created the first ar@@ ab offic@@ es in this land and why i set up the first z@@ ou@@ ave regiment , made up of mus@@ lim volun@@ te@@ ers who are now our brothers in arms .
i would like to volun@@ te@@ er in such a regiment .
not now .
i have more important work for you .
bu@@ ge@@ aud will be in oran next week . his mission is to se@@ ek peace with abd el-@@ kader .
you speak arab@@ ic , to@@ us@@ saint ?
i can pass for egyp@@ tian .
very well .
you 'll remain in@@ cogn@@ ito in the nat@@ ive city .
there , you 'll contact abd el-@@ kader 's man .
you want me to sp@@ y on the arab@@ s ?
no , we 're doing it for peace , for a good cause .
as for you , hubert , you 'll handle the chol@@ era epi@@ demi@@ c , which has hit our tro@@ ops very hard .
- and the population even harder .
- i know . hubert will treat everyone equ@@ ally .
be careful , doctor .
the other doc@@ tors before you all died of chol@@ era .
- what about you , sister ?
- god is watching over me .
le@@ ila ?
this is le@@ ila , one of our orph@@ ans .
- she spe@@ aks arab@@ ic and french .
- hello , miss .
hello , doctor .
he 's de@@ hydr@@ ated .
tell him to drink a lot . bo@@ iled water .
no need to be so formal with me .
i can te@@ ach you arab@@ ic .
he needs a new band@@ age .
i will be chap@@ er@@ on@@ ing your les@@ sons with le@@ ila .
why , sister ?
don 't you trust me ?
i need to learn arab@@ ic too .
your con@@ vent 's been here over 200 years - and you don 't speak arab@@ ic ?
- i need the theory .
cover him up .
he 's in a sorry state .
i 'm dis@@ cour@@ aged , doctor . they keep dying .
i pr@@ ay every day , but ...
medicine is making progress .
we now know it sp@@ read@@ s through water .
we 'll find a cure .
try tur@@ pent@@ ine .
your protege is great !
when the poor girl was little , arab@@ s killed her parents before her eyes .
her family 's from sp@@ ain .
but she looks and spe@@ aks arab@@ ic .
her grandmother was a " mam@@ ma rosa . "
a long time ago , a boat with 10 of our span@@ ish sisters ran ag@@ round here .
our sisters were all sol@@ d as slav@@ es to kab@@ yle and tur@@ kis@@ h chie@@ fs .
the mother superior was named maria rosa , so the off@@ spring of those forced mar@@ ri@@ ages were named " mam@@ ma rosas . "
you shouldn 't laugh .
- forgive me , sister .
- we raised le@@ ila as one of our own .
tell him children have to drink a lot .
- he said , " may allah bl@@ ess you . "
- get a stret@@ cher .
hurry !
want a woman ?
you had that one yesterday .
she 's no longer a virgin .
let me in . let me in !
- what 're you doing here ?
- you 'll blow my cover .
everyone knows who you are .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in bro@@ th@@ els and have forgotten your mission .
that 's not true .
the colonel told me to bl@@ end in , so i am .
you 've no idea what de@@ lights the east has to offer .
everything is here to please men .
these women have been raised to ful@@ fill our every desire .
od@@ il@@ on , i 'm unit@@ ing with the east on a daily basis .
- want to try ?
- have you lost your mind ?
you 'll come around .
this isn 't quite the spiritu@@ al union our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian brothers had in mind .
the colonel sent me .
he hasn 't heard from you in over a month .
you risk getting court marti@@ aled .
i found a way to contact abd el-@@ kader .
trust me .
stay .
special tr@@ icks , huh ?
i know who you are .
so do i .
why are you sp@@ ying on us ?
i 'm not sp@@ ying .
i 'm bringing peace .
we also se@@ ek peace .
but peace is worth nothing without freedom .
france is willing to respect your freedom . - if you stop the war . - it 's not up to me .
- tell your leader .
- only allah has the power - to decide
- i know .
allah has a lot of respon@@ sibil@@ ities .
- i 'm sure he could use our help .
- i 'll do my best .
- tell me about bahia .
- she 's beautiful .
- i know .
i saw her .
- she 's nice .
- haven 't you had enough women ?
- she 's different .
i 'm bahia .
my father , si kad@@ d@@ our , sent me to tell you emir abd el-@@ kader , the leader of the holy war , is ready to bro@@ ker peace .
thank you .
you 've brought me great news .
you speak french well .
my father didn 't have a son , so he taught me to read and write like a boy .
i have to go .
that means " i love you . "
- excuse me ?
- right .
- it could be use@@ ful .
yes .
but more sensu@@ ous .
yes , again .
hello , everyone !
i have great news !
- any new develop@@ ments ?
- i 'm in love .
crazy in love !
what do you think ?
it 's not what you think , od@@ il@@ on .
this is serious .
she 's from a big tent . - excuse me ?
- from a noble family .
she 's beautiful , smart ...
- who is she ?
- si kad@@ d@@ our 's daughter .
- bahia ?
- you know her ?
very well .
we studied together .
that 's fantast@@ ic , le@@ ila !
you can help me .
go tell her i love her and want to marry her .
- you want to marry an ...
- an ar@@ ab .
so ?
i won 't be the first .
the wife of the general in constant@@ ine is ar@@ ab .
no , she 's kab@@ yle .
le@@ ila ...
you know her , so go see her and tell her i love her .
please . i beg you ! do it for me .
arrang@@ ing mar@@ ri@@ ages is for old women .
she 's your friend , she 'll listen to you .
fine , i 'll play mat@@ ch@@ mak@@ er .
just for you !
- and your mission ?
- that 's the other good news .
abd el-@@ kader is ready to nego@@ ti@@ ate .
i no@@ ti@@ fied lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , who in@@ formed bu@@ ge@@ aud .
- there 's going to be a tru@@ ce .
- you don 't know arab@@ s .
it 's a r@@ use . they 'll keep fighting .
you 're one to talk , le@@ ila .
aren 't you ar@@ ab ?
not at all . i 'm kab@@ yle .
i 'm not mus@@ lim , but christian .
anyway ... religion is all that matters here .
it 's more important than blood , more important than anything !
you think he really loves me ?
he 's been with so many women .
do you love him ? i don 't know .
my father wants to give me to a friend of his .
he may be the love of your life .
all i know is i want to be his wife - and bear his children .
- sounds like love .
you know it 's up to the men .
my father won 't let me marry an in@@ fi@@ del .
that can be arrang@@ ed .
he adores you .
i don 't even know if od@@ il@@ on loves me .
i had to kiss him .
go see old zara for a love po@@ tion .
we already have one : this , - this and this .
- le@@ ila , you sound like a wh@@ ore . that 's what we are !
fa@@ thers sell us like she@@ ep .
don 't say that .
women serve men and bear their children .
i 'll choose my own husband .
- i 've already chosen .
- you love him ?
i want him . i 'll get him .
so ?
she loves you .
she 'll marry you on one condition .
- anything !
- she can only marry a mus@@ lim .
- that doesn 't bo@@ de well .
- there 's a way :
become mus@@ lim .
why not ?
go see the imam , say , " allah is great , " muhammad is his proph@@ et " and it 's done !
why not ?
i 've already thought about it .
islam is a good religion .
no pri@@ ests , no bis@@ ho@@ ps , no po@@ pe .
just you and god .
anyway , it 's the same god for everyone .
yes , but ... circum@@ cis@@ ion ?
circum@@ cis@@ ion .
don 't worry .
the bar@@ ber will give your willy a clean cut .
plus , he uses an english sha@@ ver .
sure you want to get circum@@ cis@@ ed ?
i have to to become mus@@ lim .
let me do it instead of that but@@ cher .
he 's not a but@@ cher , he 's a bar@@ ber .
that 's worse .
you don 't know the words that need to be said .
i 'm giving a part of myself to god .
want me to go with you ?
hel@@ ie !
i envi@@ ed him in a way .
he threw himself into everything , while i , the good jesu@@ it student , weig@@ hed the pro@@ s and cons for so long , i 'd never decide .
should i marry le@@ ila ?
she was beautiful and be@@ wit@@ ching , but she scared me like this country did .
done .
- we 're brothers now .
- go !
the br@@ ute had to do it 3 times !
told you so .
i 'll band@@ age you at the hospital .
i 'm mus@@ lim like you , si kad@@ d@@ our .
you gave me your word .
" i 'll give you my daughter if you become mus@@ lim . "
will you give her to me now ?
i gave you my word , so i will . as long as the un@@ cles agree .
what 's it to them ?
they 're the el@@ ders , wise men .
they decide for the family .
it 's tradition .
are you circum@@ cis@@ ed ?
what i wouldn 't do for you , bahia ...
so , are you done inspec@@ ting me ?
they agree .
i 'm grateful .
you can have bahia , but there 's the dow@@ ry .
the dow@@ ry .
how much ?
- 1,000 francs .
- alright .
and 50 she@@ ep .
fifty she@@ ep ?
where would i find those ?
buy them .
from whom ?
me .
if you want to .
- con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations ! - thanks .
bu@@ ge@@ aud signed a peace treat@@ y with abd el-@@ kader .
the treat@@ y of taf@@ na recogn@@ iz@@ es his authority over 2 / 3 of alger@@ ia .
the emir set up his camp on the tag@@ de@@ mp@@ t plateau , between mas@@ cara and the ou@@ arsen@@ is mountains .
i 'm worried , hubert .
why , colonel ?
you wanted everyone to stay where they belong@@ ed .
i hear he 's a lo@@ yal fellow .
he can 't stand our presence on mus@@ lim ground .
it 's a question of religion , which is sac@@ red .
don 't forget , hubert , that the emir is a proph@@ et as well as a military man and a po@@ et .
only islam is capable of produc@@ ing such men .
we sent him a delegation .
he re@@ quest@@ ed a doctor to treat his sick mother .
i ap@@ pointed you .
go to him . try to get in his good grac@@ es and keep me ap@@ pris@@ ed each week .
you can count on me , colonel .
enjoy your dinner , last night ?
yes , colonel .
on be@@ half of my master , emir abd el-@@ kader , prince of the fa@@ ith@@ ful , defen@@ der of the proph@@ et 's religion , welcome .
on be@@ half of france and science , i came to help the emir and his family .
our emir is sad .
his mother , the holy and re@@ vered zo@@ h@@ ra , is seriously ill .
if you cure her , he 'll shower you with gif@@ ts .
i don 't need gif@@ ts .
your master 's grat@@ itude will be ample re@@ ward .
- she 's burning up !
- it often happens to her .
it 's malaria .
- then it 's up to god .
- there 's a new medi@@ cation :
quin@@ ine .
i prepared a po@@ tion with qu@@ ina bar@@ k .
careful . it 's quite bitter .
she must take a sip every 2 hours .
i 'll be back tomorrow .
this is your house .
just ask if you need anything .
the emir will see you tomorrow morning .
i 'll come get you .
rest in peace .
go see the french doc . you 'll do his cook@@ ing and cle@@ aning .
the doctor is a sp@@ y .
watch his every move .
bring me anything that he writ@@ es .
got it ?
what will you give me for that ?
like she said , your uncle wants me for his har@@ em .
your uncle 's rich .
i 'll find you a husband .
young or old , but rich .
you 're pretty , you 'll get your pick .
who are these prison@@ ers ?
the lead@@ ers of a re@@ bel tri@@ be .
the ben z@@ et@@ oun .
welcome to my home .
have a seat .
i 'm happy that french science could serve the mother of the prince of the fa@@ ith@@ ful .
it 's a good ex@@ ample of what we can bring your country .
medicine was invent@@ ed by an ar@@ ab .
i plan on setting up a university .
our doc@@ tors will be as good as french ones .
why waste time when france offered you to ski@@ p centur@@ ies and enter the modern world .
a new world could come out of the union of the east and the west .
arab@@ s weren 't made to so@@ w whe@@ at and build cities .
- we 're nom@@ ads , sons of the wind .
- nothing solid is built on wind .
nothing solid is built without god .
god is with me . i only listen to him .
he for@@ bi@@ ds me from letting any mus@@ lim live - under christian domination .
- we don 't want to domin@@ ate you , but to bring you the benef@@ its of civiliz@@ ation and progress .
when god wants to hurt an ant , he gives it wings .
full of pride and joy , it takes to the sky .
then a little bird sees it and swal@@ lows it .
we 'll be friends if everyone st@@ ays where they bel@@ ong .
we value freedom ! only a holy war can bring freedom and indepen@@ dence .
a holy war never re@@ quired anyone but@@ cher@@ ing their enemy , like i saw at ain tem@@ ou@@ chent .
we 've made peace .
come see me whenever you please .
you 'll be welcome wh@@ er@@ ever i am .
this is from the emir .
it 's yours .
i can 't accept it .
refus@@ ing a gift is a grave insul@@ t .
- who 's she ?
- a servant for you .
- where 's my servant ahmed ?
- he asked to join the army of the fa@@ ith@@ ful .
na@@ ou@@ el 's a better cook .
na@@ ou@@ el .
you speak french ?
where are you from ?
kab@@ y@@ lia .
my father worked for a french lieutenant at the ar@@ ab office .
the emir 's soldiers came to our village .
they killed the lieutenant , ...
don 't worry , i 'll treat you well .
you 're my father and mother to me .
good night .
where will you sleep ?
- next door .
- there 's no bed .
i sleep on the floor .
call me if you need anything .
wait .
stay a while .
you smell nice .
let me guess ...
close your eyes .
good morning .
so , the coffee 's tur@@ kis@@ h , the milk is from a go@@ at , but the bread is mine .
happy ?
- don 't kiss me like that .
- you 're my master , i 'm yours .
this is :
na@@ ou@@ el was the mist@@ res@@ s-@@ servant every man secre@@ tly dreams of .
i do@@ ve head first into the be@@ wit@@ ching world of islam , which mixed no@@ bil@@ ity , po@@ etr@@ y and cru@@ el@@ ty , and where god comman@@ ded every move .
i was far from everything , el@@ se@@ where . i never though it would end and that it was simply a phase in my life .
the emir had just come back from a long expedition in the sahara .
you were right , colonel .
he 's been taking advantage , these last 2 years , of the fal@@ se peace to rule over the other trib@@ es .
he 's pl@@ under@@ ed the kab@@ y@@ lia , the ou@@ arsen@@ is , the tit@@ teri and now the sahara .
will he ever unite these disper@@ sed trib@@ es ?
if he does , it 'll be in sp@@ ite of us .
the women at the sou@@ k are saying the war with the french is about to start again .
i 'm scared .
if there 's a war , you 'll leave without me .
of course not .
i 'll take you with me .
there 's a ru@@ mor that host@@ ilit@@ ies will res@@ ume against the french .
the emir now has a regular army of 8,000 infan@@ try ,
2,000 caval@@ ry , 20 field guns , and 240 gun@@ ners .
add to that , 60,000 ir@@ regul@@ ars ar@@ med with french rif@@ les they got off our dead or from their prison@@ ers , and english guns the british consul sol@@ d them .
od@@ il@@ on ?
hel@@ ie ?
- i 'm so happy to see you !
- so am i. how are you ?
well .
have a seat .
- three stri@@ pes !
bravo !
- same to you .
haven 't you heard ? you 've been prom@@ ot@@ ed .
this is such a remo@@ te place .
- hey ! she 's ste@@ aling a letter !
- no , it 's na@@ ou@@ el .
she br@@ ings my letters to the leg@@ ation .
your servant ?
- you trust her ?
- of course . well , she 's more than my servant .
she 's my girlfriend .
- are you kid@@ ding me ?
- i 'm in love .
good thing i 'm here .
you 're so nai@@ ve , od@@ il@@ on .
she 's here to sp@@ y on you .
that 's what the arab@@ s do !
can we talk about something else ?
what br@@ ings you here ?
i 'm here with the major .
we came to see abd el-@@ kader to pre@@ vent a new out@@ break .
what 's going on ?
our gener@@ als have cap@@ tured constant@@ ine .
to join al@@ gi@@ ers and constant@@ ine , they occu@@ pied a territory abd el-@@ kader thinks is his .
is he right ?
we 're obviously being dis@@ honest .
so are the arab@@ s .
abd el-@@ kader ke@@ eps saying that god willing , he 'll throw the french into the sea .
after all , this is his land not ours .
if we leave , alger@@ ia will go back to chaos .
what about the union of the east and the west ?
we need peace first .
and freedom and equ@@ ality for arab@@ s . not a forced union .
win@@ ning is all our gener@@ als want .
they want to sub@@ due the nat@@ ives .
believe me , you should head back to oran .
- le@@ ila is waiting for you .
- how 's bahia ?
i forgot to tell you . i have a son .
- really ?
- ish@@ ma@@ el .
he 's almost a year old .
i hope you 'll atten@@ d his circum@@ cis@@ ion .
i wouldn 't miss it .
the french didn 't keep their word .
the duke of orleans and mar@@ sha@@ l val@@ ee crossed the iron gates and viol@@ ated my territory .
it 's an af@@ front to our dign@@ ity .
i wrote to louis-@@ philippe , the king of france .
he didn 't even reply .
my men are in favor of a holy war .
the his@@ sing of bul@@ lets is worth more than fresh@@ water .
that would be a mistake .
france is stronger .
it has soldiers , can@@ ons , ships .
i am not scared .
allah is with me .
my friends and i want freedom and equ@@ ality for every alger@@ ian and french person .
perhaps , but it 's your gener@@ als who lay down the law .
win@@ ning is like sal@@ t@@ water , the more you drink ,
- the thir@@ st@@ ier you get .
- no matter who w@@ ins , a lot of men will fall under enemy fire .
it 's fate , not bul@@ lets , that kill .
muslim@@ s are ready to die for their faith .
the kor@@ an says , " heaven lies in the shade of s@@ words . "
i chose the honor@@ able path : war .
war@@ n your people , so they can 't say they weren 't given fair warning .
had@@ j ham@@ ou will take you to the french out@@ post .
may allah watch over you and your family .
i 'll never forget you saved my mother .
may allah guide you towards fair and honor@@ able peace .
far@@ e@@ well .
na@@ ou@@ el ?
- where 's na@@ ou@@ el ?
- she 's gone .
- where ?
- back to the har@@ em .
what ?
she 's leaving with me .
you can 't expect a mus@@ lim to follow an in@@ fi@@ del .
- i want to see her .
- she doesn 't want to see you .
you 're lying !
she wants to leave with me .
you 're nai@@ ve , lieutenant hubert .
i sent her here to sp@@ y on you .
i don 't believe you .
you 're lying .
she showed me all your letters .
" 8,000 infan@@ try , 2,000 caval@@ ry , 20 field guns . "
you 're well in@@ formed .
get over it .
you 're a soldier .
you should know that a man who trust@@ s a woman isn 't a real man .
fight me !
you 're the emir 's guest .
he ordered me to see to your safety .
hospit@@ ality is sac@@ red to muslim@@ s .
you 're my guest .
i have to protect you .
- i owe you my life .
- i 'll kill you next time .
... with sugar , milk , dates and rais@@ ins is a de@@ light !
- le@@ ila will be eating with us .
- i see , it 's a conspir@@ acy .
you should make up your mind .
she 's perfect for you .
- don 't you like her ?
- of course i do .
so marry her !
don 't be like every single officer here who sh@@ acks up with a broad , but won 't be seen in public with her .
sorry , i ... you 're right .
it 's all in the past .
- let 's talk shop .
excuse me , i must take care of ish@@ ma@@ el .
i 'll join you .
le@@ ila , i wanted to tell you ...
what ?
fir@@ st@@ ly ... i have something to conf@@ ess .
the kab@@ yle girl ?
i know .
hel@@ ie told me .
he should mind his own business .
it 's different between us , isn 't it ?
so you 'd be willing to ...
ladies and gentlem@@ en , i raise my glass to captain hubert who just ear@@ ned a well-@@ de@@ served third stri@@ pe . to his lovely wife , our hospital 's head nurse , whose beauty and compet@@ ence will support her husband 's brilli@@ ant career .
our best w@@ ishes to the new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds .
their union is celebr@@ ated under favorable aus@@ pic@@ es .
our tro@@ ops just crus@@ hed the regular army of abd el-@@ kader , who wanted to challenge us to a battle .
but in vain .
his tro@@ ops were ann@@ ih@@ il@@ ated , thanks to my friend , colonel yusuf .
ladies and gentlem@@ en , to love and victory !
you 're very opti@@ mist@@ ic , general .
abd el-@@ kader has lost the battle but not the war .
he started a guer@@ illa war and is stir@@ ring up the trib@@ es .
here and there , perhaps .
but trust me , he lost face and there@@ fore the game .
it 's only a question of time now .
bu@@ ge@@ aud was named gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general .
he 's bringing 100,000 men .
we 'll be able to pull out all the stop@@ s .
things are clear to paris .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
we 'll turn it into a modern country .
what are they doing ?
- how do you like it ?
- it 's su@@ bl@@ ime .
- thank you .
- want something to drink ? - two gran@@ itas .
- two gran@@ itas , please .
- where did you get that ?
- in a je@@ wish store .
- it su@@ its you .
- thank you .
i pre@@ fer north african dres@@ ses . they 're more myster@@ ious .
ero@@ tic@@ ism reli@@ es on mystery .
is it true that abd el-@@ kader is 20 km from al@@ gi@@ ers ?
he was . he ra@@ i@@ ded the mit@@ id@@ ja and van@@ ished without a trace .
we haven 't seen the last of him .
this morning , we met the royal committee for the development of alger@@ ia .
there 'll be a rail@@ road from al@@ gi@@ ers to bli@@ da .
the mineral@@ og@@ ical map says we have co@@ al ...
we 're late , od@@ il@@ on .
we 're expected at noon .
your ke@@ pi .
- wait for us for lunch . - yes .
good day to you , sir .
colon@@ iz@@ ation is at a stand@@ still .
what 's the use of con@@ quer@@ ing land if no one sett@@ les there ?
no one wants to sett@@ le on a foreign land that hasn 't been completely pacif@@ ied .
it will be , lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , it will be !
i swear we 'll take out the tras@@ h by any means necessary !
but i won 't do it for s@@ wis@@ s or austri@@ an sett@@ lers ! those ignor@@ ant dr@@ un@@ ks !
you 're right , general .
to make the most out of these huge areas the nom@@ adi@@ c arab@@ s have ne@@ gle@@ c@@ ted , we need big capit@@ alist compan@@ ies who pos@@ s@@ ess great means .
we re@@ commen@@ d it , as the modern and effec@@ tive way .
fid@@ d@@ lest@@ icks !
that 's typ@@ ical of your saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian friends .
a bunch of dre@@ amer@@ s and vision@@ aries !
you see , lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere , i haven 't been to the poly@@ technique , un@@ like yourself .
i 'm a soldier and a far@@ mer .
i learned everything on my limous@@ in farm .
the mit@@ id@@ ja isn 't the beau@@ ce .
may i respec@@ t@@ fully point out , general , that the limous@@ in isn 't the mit@@ id@@ ja either .
believe it or not , captain to@@ us@@ saint , i had noticed that .
" ense et ar@@ atro . " it 's my mot@@ to .
with the sword and p@@ low .
like cinc@@ in@@ nat@@ us , the roman far@@ mer@@ -@@ soldier . veter@@ ans can sett@@ le here after their service is done :
p@@ low , horse , rif@@ le .
i 'll even give them w@@ ives .
nat@@ ives ?
my chief of staff , who 's reti@@ red , is now the mayor of to@@ ulon .
he can get me serv@@ ants , wid@@ o@@ ws , single women ... you catch my dri@@ ft .
ger@@ maine , do you take gustave to be your husband , to be fa@@ ith@@ ful un@@ to him and be part of the church ?
- i do .
- gustave , do you take ger@@ maine to be your wife , to be fa@@ ith@@ ful un@@ to her and be part of the church ?
- you are now joined in holy mat@@ rim@@ ony .
here are your rings .
poor girl .
- i hear she 's an or@@ phan .
- who knows , she might be happy .
fat chance !
it 's the luck of the draw .
- ger@@ main , do you take ...
- know what they 're doing ?
they 've giving land to young soldiers who 've complet@@ ed 5 of their 7 years of service .
- so ?
- so they won 't leave .
they 'll have to spend at least 2 more years here .
here is your title of ow@@ ner@@ ship , a p@@ low and a horse to go with it , and a rif@@ le to defend yourself against those bastar@@ ds .
mad@@ am , here is the key to your house .
live happ@@ ily and prosp@@ er .
here is your title of ow@@ ner@@ ship , a p@@ low and a horse to go with it , and a rif@@ le to defend yourself against those bastar@@ ds .
- thank you , general .
- mad@@ am , here is the key - to your house . - thank you .
live happ@@ ily and prosp@@ er .
friends ! after having con@@ quer@@ ed this land in the name of france , you will now farm it and make it your new home for you and your children .
i wish you all the best .
drum roll .
we 're ste@@ aling the arab@@ s ' land , general .
no need to ex@@ ag@@ gerate .
they weren 't using it .
but smal@@ l-@@ scale far@@ ming won 't turn alger@@ ia into beau@@ ce .
if abd el-@@ kader lets us .
the gover@@ nor chose to send 3 un@@ its after him .
i 'm to command one .
with all due respect , i 'm not sure i 'd like to join the hunt .
you don 't have a choice , to@@ us@@ saint .
i 've just received word you 'll be serv@@ ing under the young duke of au@@ male who 'll command yusuf 's unit .
you 'll be his interpre@@ ter and hubert , his medical officer .
the king 's son !
that 's rather flat@@ tering .
i regret losing you , but it 'll be good for your car@@ e@@ ers .
colonel yusuf spotted the smal@@ ah .
it el@@ u@@ ded us twice in 4 days , but we have it now .
it 's here ! by the tag@@ u@@ ine well . the tro@@ ops , the women and children .
how on earth can they move camp that quickly ?
i don 't know , my lord .
it 's incredi@@ ble .
is abd el-@@ kader with them ?
i didn 't want to sound the alarm by getting too close .
- when abd el-@@ kader isn 't there , he leaves 500 men .
we have enough caval@@ ry@@ men .
let 's go .
we should wait for the infan@@ try . they 're 3 hours away .
sound the charge , lieutenant .
my lord , the duke of au@@ male told me to in@@ form you that he cap@@ tured abd el-@@ kader 's smal@@ ah at noon on may 16 .
we left with the caval@@ ry at dawn and en@@ counter@@ ed them at noon .
i 'll never forget this extraordin@@ aire event .
get to the point , my friend .
the african chas@@ seurs went around the smal@@ ah to take it from the re@@ ar while colonel yusuf laun@@ ched a fron@@ tal attack .
chaos and panic en@@ su@@ ed . there was a stam@@ pe@@ de .
good .
very well indeed .
what about abd el-@@ kader ?
he wasn 't there , general .
general ! we cap@@ tured 300 notables and war@@ lor@@ ds , their famili@@ es , horses and she@@ ep , and abd el-@@ kader 's war chest :
a wonderful boot@@ y .
it almost cost the duke of au@@ male his life .
coming , hubert ?
- so ?
- all hope is lost , my lord .
guard !
move away !
let the women and child go and i 'll sur@@ ren@@ der !
take them away .
you saved my life , captain .
is there anything you want ?
give me the 3 prison@@ ers .
they 're yours .
she wants to see you .
she 's waiting for you outside .
- why did you abandon me , od@@ il@@ on ?
- abandon you ?
you sp@@ ied on me and betr@@ ayed me .
you believed him ?
i knew it .
had@@ j ham@@ ou kid@@ n@@ apped me and put me in his har@@ em .
and the letters ?
he only managed to get one from me .
i 'm here , od@@ il@@ on , to tell you
i never betr@@ ayed you .
but you doub@@ ted me .
no .
you didn 't love me enough .
is that your son ?
ours .
ais@@ sa .
no one must ever know , otherwise had@@ j ham@@ ou will kill my son and i .
i 'm his wife .
he put me in his har@@ em .
he never asked me anything .
had@@ j ham@@ ou is a good man ,
he 's a good husband and father .
ais@@ sa and i are his .
i simply wanted you to know .
hel@@ ie told me you 're married .
i am .
i had mis@@ jud@@ ged her .
- she 's a good person .
your worl@@ ds are too different .
- you 're one to talk .
- it 's not the same for me .
you think a man can love several women at once ?
muslim@@ s can have up to 4 women .
but there 's always a favorite .
some must sometimes love 2 women equ@@ ally .
i 'm done .
come in .
you wanted to kill me and almost did .
- it wasn 't god 's will .
- i know i owe you my life . so you 're free to go .
- i 'll take up arms again .
- that 's your right .
- i 'm inde@@ b@@ ted to you .
- no , we 're even now .
set na@@ ou@@ el and the child free .
we 're now bound for life , you and i .
it is our destiny .
i thought the battle of the smal@@ ah would end the war , but abd el-@@ kader would be on the run for another 4 years .
for 4 years , hel@@ ie and i wit@@ nes@@ sed yusuf and lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere 's hell@@ ish raz@@ z@@ ias which were answered by pil@@ es of sever@@ ed french heads .
the emir f@@ led to mor@@ oc@@ co , where he was followed by bu@@ ge@@ aud who won the battle of is@@ ly .
the following year , abd el-@@ kader but@@ cher@@ ed a french bat@@ tal@@ ion at si@@ di-@@ bra@@ him .
on christmas eve 1847 , after having resist@@ ed one of the most powerful coun@@ tries on earth for 15 years , the emir admitted defe@@ at .
it was god 's will .
bu@@ dge call !
accept this horse as sub@@ mission .
it 's the last one i 'll ride .
i will now go on foot .
i accept your hom@@ age to france , which gr@@ ants you its protection , as a sign that the past has been for@@ given .
you cu@@ red my holy mother .
may god watch over you and yours .
had i had men like yours , i 'd now be in al@@ gi@@ ers .
since you defe@@ ated me , you 're the only person i can entr@@ ust with the weapons i used in the last 15 years of fighting you .
i will not be ne@@ eding them anymore .
i will devo@@ te the rest of my life to god .
god is great .
past enem@@ ies can turn into future friends if they keep a pure heart .
you may see me as alive , but i am dead .
squ@@ ad@@ ron leader hubert , on be@@ half of his majest@@ y louis-@@ philippe , i ap@@ point you knight of the legion of honor .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , hubert , and thank you again .
squ@@ ad@@ ron leader to@@ us@@ saint , on be@@ half of his majest@@ y , i ap@@ point you knight of the legion of honor .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
end of the proclam@@ ation !
- con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , dear friends .
- thank you .
you deserve it .
a lot re@@ mains to be done in this great country .
we 'll build it instead of destroy it .
you know there 's fighting in paris right now .
there 's talk of a second republic .
so we 'll finally see that republic .
- what will happen to alger@@ ia ?
- a republic means liberty , equ@@ ality and frat@@ ern@@ ity for every man .
trans@@ lation :
mag@@ enta bar@@ i@@ beau ep@@ ilo@@ gue
welcome to alger@@ ia , where much re@@ mains to be done .
the saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans ' mission is clear :
we want to protect the arab@@ s ' language and religion .
i came to help the emir 's family with french knowledge .
may allah protect them .
i chose the honor@@ able path : war .
i came to see for myself that you 're hiding in bro@@ th@@ els and have forgotten your mission .
i found a way to contact ad@@ bel@@ kader .
violence is the only thing arab@@ s respect .
these sav@@ ages must die !
this is a gen@@ oci@@ de , not a war .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers even wrote that we 're the barbar@@ ians .
a to@@ ast to his lovely wife .
our best w@@ ishes to the new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds .
you think a man can love several women simultan@@ e@@ ously ?
there 's always a favorite .
i never betr@@ ayed you .
no one must ever know , otherwise had@@ j ham@@ ou will kill my son and i .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
you 're the only person i can entr@@ ust with the weapons i used to fight you these last 15 years .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 2 .
death 's fi@@ an@@ cee
mother ...
jeremy ?
emile and jeanne must do the home@@ work that i spent last night prepar@@ ing .
thank you .
had we stayed in oran , instead of moving to this god@@ for@@ sak@@ en place , our children could go to school and get a normal education .
as soon as we have the money , we 'll send them to the al@@ gi@@ ers boar@@ ding school .
did you know that the boy with ty@@ pho@@ id died ?
i know .
i did all i could .
i hope they won 't catch it .
they played with him .
is there any milk , d@@ jam@@ ila ?
not that one .
i don 't like go@@ at milk .
it 's s@@ our .
there aren 't any co@@ ws here , swe@@ eti@@ e .
we wouldn 't be here if your father hadn 't left the army .
where is he going , mother ?
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republic@@ an and pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
nothing to be as@@ ham@@ ed of .
i was a republic@@ an .
the ' 48 revolution hit paris , then oran .
i believed in the new republic . and i still do . and i 'm most certainly pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
the europe@@ ans mixed up revolution and beat@@ ings .
i paid the price after napoleon iii 's dec@@ ember ' 51 coup .
don 't stay there . you have plenty of room .
spread it out !
le@@ ila wanted us to leave for france .
but leaving alger@@ ia was out of the question .
so i rent@@ ed this farm from a sett@@ ler from ar@@ ie@@ ge who became dis@@ hear@@ tened and left with a bad f@@ ever .
" these dates are excellent . "
period .
" the um@@ bre@@ lla is ... " a nice shade " of red . "
- what 's wrong , jeanne ?
- my stomach hur@@ ts .
you don 't have a f@@ ever .
ya@@ oul@@ ed wrote " um@@ pre@@ lla . "
- with a p !
- stop te@@ asing ya@@ oul@@ ed .
i 'd like to see you write arab@@ ic !
he can 't write arab@@ ic either !
don 't listen to him . you 've made tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous progress .
- he made 15 mist@@ akes yesterday .
- you made 12 !
why isn 't is@@ hem here ?
she 's a girl .
her father won 't allow it .
- why not ?
- she might get ideas .
alright . let 's continue .
the cam@@ el has big teeth .
ya@@ oul@@ ed , make sure your she@@ ep don 't eat my wife 's flowers .
why are you calling me ya@@ oul@@ ed ?
i 'm ahmed .
you 're oran 's ya@@ oul@@ ed to me .
go get the others , ahmed , i 've got a surprise .
try them on . you 'll be able to work faster .
against thor@@ ns and rocks .
your week 's pay .
kader . cher@@ if .

clean the st@@ ables and the horses ' bed@@ ding like i showed you .
boss ! mr. char@@ mas@@ son is coming .
the de@@ lor@@ me farm was att@@ acked this morning .
you 're a doc , - there might be some wo@@ unded .
- go get my kit .
antoine ?
marie ?
sav@@ ages ! mad@@ men !
come .
there 's nothing we can do here .
go get help at the village . we 'll give them a nice bur@@ ial .
mad@@ men !
what 's the army waiting for ?
you know they hate sett@@ lers .
they 're sav@@ ages !
the only solution is to er@@ adic@@ ate them , like the americ@@ ans did with the indi@@ ans .
this is their land .
they were wast@@ ing it .
don 't make exc@@ uses for them !
i 'm not !
i 'm only trying to understand .
there 's nothing to understand , hubert !
their own brothers ...
why ? why !
" had@@ jou@@ ts " kill in@@ fi@@ del@@ s and trait@@ ors
- so they can go to heaven . - bull@@ shit !
that 's what the mar@@ about said .
it 's holy war , " ji@@ had . "
the man who kil@@ ls goes to heaven .
why are they wearing their shoes around their ne@@ cks ?
their feet hurt .
they pre@@ fer going bar@@ e@@ foot .
- but they cost me a fortune !
- good .
they won 't get used .
the wor@@ kers want to invite you and your wife to thank you .
there 's way too much .
we can 't eat all this .
polit@@ en@@ ess dic@@ tat@@ es you have to eat a lot .
then you bur@@ p and say that you 're full .
he 'll be pleased .
this is stupid .
they probably spent all the money
- you gave them this morning .
- they 're gener@@ ous and be@@ having like lor@@ ds .
it 's del@@ icious .
he has trach@@ oma .
we have to do something .
he can come to the farm whenever he wants .
it 's because of marie . - it 's a race .
- they should close the val@@ ve .
that 's right , blame allah .
- you 're not married ?
- i 'm not rich enough .
wash his eyes every@@ day or he 'll become blind .
always wash children 's hands and faces .
- we don 't have much water .
- come get some at the farm .
not too tired ?
are you due soon ?
mother ...
jeanne is crying .
what 's wrong ?
what 's going on ?
ty@@ pho@@ id f@@ ever !
i knew it .
she 'll die !
- calm down .
we 'll treat her .
- stop it ! i 'm a nurse !
everyone around is dying of chol@@ era , ty@@ pho@@ id and dys@@ enter@@ y !
you 're ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
4@@ 28 people died at the " fun@@ du@@ q " last year .
and 94 in bou@@ far@@ ik .
the mit@@ id@@ ja is a rotten s@@ wam@@ p !
the arab@@ s were right calling it " death 's fi@@ an@@ cee . "
if the mos@@ quit@@ o@@ es don 't get us , had@@ jou@@ ts will sli@@ t our thro@@ ats
- and we 'll all die ! - enough !
you 're exhaust@@ ed .
go to bed .
i 'll take care of jeanne .
yes , i 'm exhaust@@ ed .
i can 't stand it .
i want to leave .
i 'll leave with the kids if you want to stay .
how will you get by ?
we don 't have any money .
i 'll find work as a nurse or as a ma@@ id .
the children will go to school .
i want to leave .
then leave !
i can 't stand your constant wh@@ in@@ ing !
come with us . i beg you !
no .
i bel@@ ong here .
- hurry , mother !
i 'll go see the chief physic@@ ian at the mustafa hospital .
he agreed to hire me .
- he 's a good man .
- i hope you 'll enjoy yourself .
al@@ gi@@ ers is full of thie@@ ves and advent@@ ur@@ ers .
will you come visit ?
i 'll visit the children . time permit@@ ting .
take them to bli@@ da .
the army has set up convo@@ ys to al@@ gi@@ ers .
goodbye , swe@@ eti@@ e .
goodbye , emile .
- bye , d@@ jam@@ ila .
- we never should have come here .
i know .
take care of yourself .
gee up !
i 've had enough of paris .
it 's so gray and expen@@ sive here .
i don 't have any friends .
why don 't we go home to al@@ gi@@ ers ?
i hear le@@ ila and her children are there .
- what about od@@ il@@ on ?
- he stayed on the farm .
i don 't get him .
we always said :
the land is for the arab@@ s , commerce , industry and mines for the french .
you 're not listening to me .
i don 't feel at home here .
the children are te@@ ased at school because they 're mus@@ lim and the sal@@ es@@ girls don 't respect me .
i 'm fighting for you , the children and the alger@@ ians , so people will respect your religion , val@@ ues and the color of your skin .
alger@@ ia 's fate is being decided here in paris .
we 've been here for years and no one listened to you .
the republic no longer exist@@ s . the republic no longer exist@@ s .
this is an empire , but nothing has changed .
you 're wrong .
remember fle@@ ury ?
- the young lieutenant ?
- he 's a general now ,
his majest@@ y 's clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ or .
i sent him my pam@@ ph@@ lets and my book .
he read them to the emper@@ or .
it 'll happen , you 'll see .
then we 'll go home ? i promise .
we 'll go home to alger@@ ia .
i love you , bahia .
so it doesn 't matter where we are .
you 're right .
my dear to@@ us@@ saint , we have good news for you .
they 're about to start building the al@@ gier@@ s-@@ bli@@ da rail@@ road .
our friend four@@ nel is surve@@ ying alger@@ ia 's mineral re@@ sources . - he sent his report .
- quite prom@@ ising .
- we plan to inv@@ est .
- large sum@@ s .
thank you , sir@@ s .
with your help , alger@@ ia will become
- a modern country .
- ap@@ ologies for my tar@@ din@@ ess .
we 're making head@@ way . the emper@@ or fre@@ ed ad@@ bel@@ kader and author@@ ized him to leave france for tur@@ key .
as the duke of au@@ male and general lam@@ or@@ ici@@ ere had promised him when he sur@@ ren@@ dered over 5 years ago .
despite this promise , france kept him prison@@ er - all these years . - i know , i know .
that was during king louis-@@ philippe 's re@@ ign .
the emper@@ or made am@@ ends .
he brought ad@@ bel@@ kader to long@@ champ rac@@ es , the opera , a@@ war@@ ded him the legion of honor .
we 're now best friends .
won 't his liberation fu@@ el alger@@ ia 's holy war ?
he promised never to take up arms against france .
the only way to en@@ sure peace in alger@@ ia is to make it an independent colon@@ y where all alger@@ ians would be equ@@ al cit@@ iz@@ ens .
the emper@@ or is in favor of that .
he spent most of his ex@@ ile in england and ad@@ mi@@ res
- british institutions .
- so what 's he waiting for ? it 's time to give that territory its own stat@@ ute .
he has other wor@@ ries :
russia , ital@@ y ...
didn 't we declare in 1839 and again in 1848 that alger@@ ia was and would remain a french province ?
isn 't this matter already closed ?
i hope not .
wanting arab@@ s to ab@@ ide by french rules would be a mistake .
they have different custom@@ s and val@@ ues and another religion .
grab a plate . eat with me .
no , it 's por@@ k .
- i can 't eat it .
- there must be some chicken too .
thank you .
straight ! you want a straight line !
get out of here !
i said leave !
there you are .
can you tell that idiot to leave my land ?
these dar@@ n nom@@ ads don 't respect private property .
of course .
they don 't know what that is .
what he say ?
that it 's communal land that belong@@ s to everyone .
are you kid@@ ding ?
he knows i bought it from the government .
scr@@ am !
look at that strange se@@ t-@@ up .
it 's a great concept .
the cam@@ el is strong , but doesn 't walk straight .
the don@@ key does .
- it 's quite ingen@@ ious .
- i see you 're still pro-@@ ar@@ ab . they 're bad neighbor@@ s .
so you sent your wife and kids to al@@ gi@@ ers ?
- she wanted to leave .
- can 't blame her .
this is a hard place for women and children .
come see me tomorrow .
i 'll be plant@@ ing a liberty tree .
we can have a drink .
it 'll take your mind off things .
friends , this liberty tree is just like those we plant@@ ed in france during the ' 48 revolution , a symbol of our faith in the republic .
napoleon iii dese@@ cr@@ ated the second republic and depor@@ ted 12,000 of us to these wild african lands .
why ?
because guer@@ in stood on the high@@ est bar@@ ric@@ ade at the fau@@ bourg saint-@@ antoine .
because rou@@ car@@ ies refused to use his journ@@ alist@@ ic tal@@ ents to serve the us@@ ur@@ per .
bravo !
and you , lu@@ do@@ vic , because the town@@ spe@@ ople had elec@@ ted you republic@@ an mayor !
they wanted to break us , but we and our span@@ ish friends will show them what 12,000 free men working on this alger@@ ian land are capable of !
let 's turn this rotten mit@@ id@@ ja into a garden that we can one day trans@@ form into a new republic .
i propose the creation of a sett@@ lers association and a new@@ sp@@ aper , " the sett@@ ler 's voice , "
that rou@@ car@@ ies will manage .
long live the republic !
music !
don 't forget republic@@ an princip@@ les mean liberty , equ@@ ality and frat@@ ern@@ ity for everyone , including arab@@ s .
you must be kid@@ ding , hubert .
these sav@@ ages cut our com@@ patri@@ ots ' thro@@ ats !
you want to turn them into fren@@ ch@@ men ?
you abol@@ ished sla@@ very in ' 48 .
be coher@@ ent .
arab@@ s are men like you and i. we 're all brothers .
what a ser@@ mon !
leave that to the ar@@ ab represent@@ atives .
beni sas@@ sen 's ka@@ id is throwing a party next week .
captain au@@ dr@@ an invit@@ ed us .
come with , you 'll see .
you 're going ?
it 's id al-@@ adha , an important mus@@ lim holiday . we sacrif@@ ice she@@ ep to com@@ memor@@ ate abraham 's sacrif@@ ice .
wasn 't abraham je@@ wish ?
juda@@ ism , christian@@ ity and islam are sister religi@@ ons ,
talking about she@@ ep ...
you know it 's the nom@@ ads ' main source of in@@ come .
they say they don 't have enough graz@@ ing fields .
au@@ dr@@ an , i see what you 're getting at .
their she@@ ep graz@@ ing on our land is a real problem .
they tr@@ ample our se@@ ed@@ lings and eat our whe@@ at .
one flo@@ ck of she@@ ep graz@@ ed on your land .
we paid the fine .
they 're nom@@ ads . they can go el@@ se@@ where .
each tri@@ be fol@@ lows its own route .
setting foot on another tri@@ be 's land could start a war .
that 's their problem .
you 're not making my job any easier .
we 're trying to build trust with trib@@ es lo@@ yal to our country but the en@@ camp@@ ment polic@@ y , which was adop@@ ted against the army 's ad@@ vice and gave you land that belong@@ ed to the arab@@ s , is turning the trib@@ es against us and under@@ min@@ ing our work .
what work ?
we 're the wor@@ kers here , not you or them .
you wouldn 't be here without the army !
that 's an entrance !
yes , they know how to fight !
you said it .
you don 't want these hor@@ sem@@ en to become our enem@@ ies again .
don 't worry , captain .
we know how to defend our@@ selves .
sure .
like the de@@ lor@@ mes family .
be careful , boss .
why ?
the mar@@ about said , " the time has come .
" take the fren@@ ch@@ man 's land , she@@ ep and wife .
everything ! "
then everyone chant@@ ed , " god is great . "
they 've been saying this for 20 years , but we 're still here .
boss !
the wor@@ kers !
- what about them ?
- they left .
- what do you mean ?
- the wor@@ kers , she@@ ep ,
- horses and mul@@ es , all gone !
- do you know where they went ?
no .
- they 're all gone ?
damn it !
they even took their shoes !
i thought they hurt their feet !
- they can sell them at the sou@@ k .
- and the cat@@ tle ?
- you think they st@@ ole all this ?
the had@@ j@@ out .
mr. said listened and che@@ ered on the mar@@ about .
- take this and guard the farm .
- where are you going , boss ?
to get a horse - and find them . - be careful , boss .
had@@ jou@@ ts are very mean .
- let me call the army .
- certainly not ! - there 'd be a massacre .
- had@@ jou@@ ts will but@@ cher you .
they know who i am .
thanks for the horse !
what if le@@ ila was right ?
i 'm a doctor , not a far@@ mer .
maybe i should give up and leave .
then i realized it 's too late .
we have to stay , change these people , give them la@@ ws , ci@@ vili@@ ze them .
i was crazy about alger@@ ia .
it 's such a beautiful country .
i come as a friend .
- i 'm not ar@@ med !
- where are my wor@@ kers ?
- they work for us now .
you work your own brothers like slav@@ es ?
pun@@ ishment for their betr@@ ay@@ al .
the had@@ jou@@ ts i met were ab@@ del@@ kader 's best warriors . now they 're just cut@@ throat mur@@ der@@ ous co@@ wards !
they viol@@ ated a saint 's grave ! that 's sac@@ ril@@ ege !
they were pun@@ ished .
it 's god 's law .
- pay !
- i have no money .
heard that ? they want your wife .
we 'll visit your wife . she 'll pay for you .
kill me now .
we 'll show her this and she 'll come get you .
she 'll bring the army .
you 'll all be shot !
a@@ icha ...
i read your articles and pam@@ ph@@ let on alger@@ ia .
let me say that i completely dis@@ agree with your arab@@ oph@@ ile views .
you 're ent@@ it@@ led to your opinion .
i suppose you 're an arab@@ op@@ ho@@ be ?
call it what you will .
as depart@@ mental head of the alger@@ ian government my views are not theo@@ retic@@ al , but based on real things .
i thought we were discus@@ sing people - and not things .
- what are your views ?
the cross and the cre@@ scent are ir@@ recon@@ cil@@ able .
christ@@ ians and muslim@@ s can@@ not live together unless one domin@@ ates the other .
- why should christ@@ ians domin@@ ate ?
- it 's the law of the jungle .
you 're shocked ?
this is how it 's been thro@@ ugh@@ out history .
we 're the masters of alger@@ ia .
why can 't the cross and the cre@@ scent get along ?
the arab@@ s have refused to cooper@@ ate these last 20 years .
they w@@ age wars on us , cut our sett@@ lers ' thro@@ ats , burn our far@@ ms , dream of throwing us in the sea .
it 's because we see them as the defe@@ ated and not as part@@ ners .
what if co@@ ss@@ acks or prus@@ si@@ ans still occu@@ pied paris ? if they had burned your family home in nor@@ mand@@ y , se@@ ized your land and destroy@@ ed your chur@@ ches ?
forgive me , general , but i refuse to continue to debate with someone who compar@@ es our tro@@ ops to co@@ ss@@ acks !
this is in@@ suff@@ er@@ able !
come , darling .
can you believe that fool ?
to think they 're considering him for the secre@@ tary general position in al@@ gi@@ ers .
he treated me like a " mou@@ kere . " i put him in his place .
you should have seen the look on his face !
you did well , bahia .
general fle@@ ury offered me an as@@ sign@@ ment in al@@ gi@@ ers .
my articles and my book are quite popular over there .
- say you 'll take me with you .
- of course i will .
and we 'll visit od@@ il@@ on .
i haven 't heard from him in over a year .
le@@ ila wrote me that she 's worried about him .
you smell nice .
do as i say .
- you were with those thie@@ ves ?
- when ab@@ del@@ kader sur@@ ren@@ dered , i took my wife and son and went home with a broken heart .
how is your son ?
- i 'm trying to make him a man .
- may allah watch over him .
ab@@ del@@ kader and i only wished to go to the mec@@ ca , but the french didn 't keep their word and kept him prison@@ er .
so i joined the had@@ j@@ out . you saw it :
lions became vul@@ tures . - mur@@ der@@ ers .
- it 's not their fault .
the french are stronger .
you fought vali@@ antly .
the time for peace has come .
i 'll speak to gover@@ nor rand@@ on on your be@@ half .
god willing .
he 's the only one i trust .
it 's up to him .
enough about god !
he hel@@ ps those who help themselves !
my mind 's made up . i 'm going to al@@ gi@@ ers .
you 're deser@@ ting , hubert .
far@@ ming is hard work ,
- but we can 't give up . - my wife was right .
we 're not made to live this way .
you 'll find someone else to le@@ ase the farm .
that 's not the problem .
span@@ i@@ ards can work it .
think it over .
need some help ?
boss , i want to go to al@@ gi@@ ers with you .
i can guard your house , take the children to school , - anything !
- of course .
- your wife will be thril@@ led .
- you think so ?
she cried a lot when i took her to bli@@ da .
you 're part of the family .
you 're like a mother and father to me .
i fell in love with the white city of al@@ gi@@ ers that em@@ brac@@ es the mediterran@@ ean shore .
le@@ ila had waited for me and for@@ given me .
she worked as a nurse , was radi@@ antly happy , had found her place in society .
i finally set up my own practice .
al@@ gi@@ ers 's european community was exp@@ and@@ ing by the day .
i had become convinced the only way to save this country was to make it a french province .
not for military men , but for sett@@ lers turning this place into a new country .
od@@ il@@ on !
how are you ?
let me introdu@@ ce our copy editor , benjamin ben@@ so@@ us@@ san , and jeanne , the " illu@@ stration " correspon@@ dent .
hello .
excuse me . what do you think of this ?
i went all out .
it 's 4 pages long .
there 's your bio@@ graphy , what happened to you , everything !
you 'll become a hero to the colon@@ y !
here 's your tale .
you 're very tal@@ ent@@ ed !
i said that before , haven 't i ?
we should team up .
i could sell you half my shar@@ es .
- i don 't have any money .
- same here !
buy them on credit .
- let 's shake on it .
- sol@@ d . i 'm for the sett@@ lers , now i know how they oper@@ ate .
you finally got it .
it 's all here in my editorial .
" paris 's indi@@ ffer@@ ence . " the army 's in@@ compet@@ ence and arro@@ gan@@ ce .
" nat@@ ive laz@@ iness . "
read the conclusion ! i showed rand@@ on what 's what !
" down with the sword . it 's time for civil power .
" alger@@ ia is french ! "
- want to show me around ?
- with pleasure .
children , did you know your father is a hero ?
it 's in all the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers .
- don 't ex@@ ag@@ gerate .
- i heard about it in school .
why are you a hero , father ?
did you kill a lot of arab@@ s ?
- no . why would you think that ?
- when we play cops and rob@@ bers , the rob@@ bers are always arab@@ s .
ridiculous !
i 'll have a word with your teacher !
they won 't let me be a cop .
- why not ?
- they say i 'm mixed .
what 's that ?
someone who 's half-@@ half .
half french and half ar@@ ab .
- am i half ar@@ ab ?
- i don 't wan@@ na be !
you 're not .
you 're a quar@@ ter kab@@ yle .
- pass me the jam .
- isn 't that the same ?
not at all !
kab@@ y@@ les are not arab@@ s .
so i can be a cop .
yes .
of course you can play cop , but you can 't kill anyone .
- got it ?
- hurry up , you 'll be late .
- bye .
- have a nice day .
make sure you pay attention .
- bye , swe@@ eti@@ e .
- do we understand each other ?
- yes .
- have a nice day .
everyone is talking about you .
i like it here .
i feel like i 'm in france .
- but with arab@@ s .
- we live separ@@ ately here .
i have to go .
general rand@@ on asked me to come see him .
see you tonight .
so , hubert , you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you 're a reti@@ red officer , aren 't you ?
- i am , general .
- and you write for this rag , run by rou@@ car@@ ies .
a com@@ mie !
we should have sent him to new cal@@ edonia .
- he 's a republic@@ an , general .
- a com@@ mie ! an anarch@@ ist !
he defen@@ ds mer@@ cen@@ aries , advent@@ ur@@ ers and depor@@ tees who come to alger@@ ia to explo@@ it nat@@ ive labor !
let me re@@ mind you , general , that the sett@@ lers are colon@@ iz@@ ing and far@@ ming this land - on be@@ half of france .
- land that the army con@@ quer@@ ed !
we 'll discus@@ s this some other time .
i asked you here because you 're familiar with the mit@@ id@@ ja .
i 'm worried . new in@@ cid@@ ents have been repor@@ ted .
mar@@ about si@@ di yac@@ ou@@ b trav@@ els the area and gets them all worked up .
it 's an epi@@ demi@@ c !
re@@ ports of so-@@ called mar@@ abou@@ ts all over the country , calling for " ji@@ had . "
- they have mon@@ keys and go@@ ats . - it 's an old tradition .
they capture the imagination of the nai@@ ve and ignor@@ ant who fall for their che@@ ap tr@@ icks .
- they 're il@@ lus@@ ion@@ ists .
- exactly .
- ever heard of robert hou@@ din ?
your mar@@ abou@@ ts couldn 't hold a cand@@ le to him .
- i asked paris to send him here .
- i fa@@ il to see the connection .
arab@@ s are a super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous people .
they 're amaz@@ ed by sle@@ ight of hand .
i 'll show them a better mag@@ ic@@ ian than all their mar@@ abou@@ ts .
robert hou@@ din !
general bu@@ ge@@ aud once tried to send them fal@@ se proph@@ ets .
they were all mur@@ dered .
this is different !
this one 's french !
i 'd bet you anything that he 'll amaz@@ e them !
he amaz@@ ed me , so ...
the arab@@ s want to see wonder@@ s , so i 'll show them wonder@@ s !
one last thing , i 'm told you 're friends with an auth@@ or called to@@ us@@ saint , a man turning paris up@@ side down , demand@@ ing that arab@@ s
- be considered our equ@@ als ?
- i am . he 's here , on a mission for general fle@@ ury .
i had to give him an office .
i 'm not sure what he 's up to , but i don 't like it , so i 'm having him followed .
try to get some information out of him and keep me ap@@ pri@@ z@@ ed .
want some wine , boss ?
ahmed , i told you to call him " sir . "
sorry .
want some wine , s@@ ire ?
- sir .
- no , i 'm fine , ya@@ oul@@ ed .
and stop calling him ya@@ oul@@ ed .
his name 's ahmed .
didn 't i tell you ?
i decided we should fren@@ chif@@ y our li@@ fest@@ yle .
i ordered restor@@ ation arm@@ chairs .
i like the sitting room the way it is .
that stuck@@ -up woman at the general 's asked if i was a moor !
that 's why . that 's not an insul@@ t .
you 're half span@@ ish , a quar@@ ter kab@@ yle and a quar@@ ter french .
and the end res@@ ult is not bad at all .
i 'm french !
i don 't want people thinking i 'm a " mou@@ kere ! "
did you know the to@@ us@@ saints were here ?
the moved into one of the best pal@@ aces in al@@ gi@@ ers .
i know . he 's important now .
he 's general fle@@ ury 's agent and spe@@ aks for paris@@ ian arab@@ oph@@ iles .
i saw bahia this afternoon .
she 's putting on air@@ s now that she 's lived in paris .
- sau@@ ce ?
- please .
she invit@@ ed us to dinner tomorrow night .
i 'm looking forward to seeing hel@@ ie .
- isn 't this a bit cold ?
- no .
sorry , but it is .
ya@@ oul@@ ed ?
ahmed .
ahmed !
could we have for@@ ks ?
i don 't eat with my hands anymore .
so ?
i don 't understand why you stopped writing me .
you let me down .
you 'd promised to ask your friends to help me .
- i 'm still waiting .
- sorry , it wasn 't easy with all these changes of regime : first a kingdom , then a republic , and now an empire .
- you don 't know how it is .
- i do .
jud@@ ging by your stri@@ pes , you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
what happened to you ?
you 've changed .
while you were having fun in paris , - i went through hell here !
- why did you become a sett@@ ler ?
that 's enough .
i 've heard enough .
go see how they live on the mit@@ id@@ ja !
i now understand what " bad sett@@ lers " are .
excuse me .
- how are your children ?
- well .
and yours ?
well .
i 'd like them to live here .
why ?
they 're lucky enough to study in france .
excuse me .
i 'd like them to know their hom@@ eland and to speak arab@@ ic .
what for ?
what 's important is that they speak french .
it 's their culture , their ro@@ ots .
i don 't want them to den@@ y their orig@@ ins , like others do .
is this why you still wear a " j@@ ell@@ aba " ?
i 'm proud to wear it .
and it will never go out of style .
it 's their damn religion that put@@ s them to sleep .
medieval fat@@ alism .
what are you doing to help them ?
tour@@ ing robert hou@@ din dis@@ gu@@ ised as a mar@@ about ?
you want them to stay ignor@@ ant so you can domin@@ ate them .
we have to defend our@@ selves .
your deser@@ tion polic@@ y would have us all leave within 5 years .
did you forget our dream of unit@@ ing the east and the west ?
only equ@@ ality and progress can give arab@@ s their dign@@ ity back .
they don 't want your progress .
ask our saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian brothers . ask tal@@ ab@@ ot .
they 're sab@@ ot@@ ag@@ ing his rail@@ road .
to modern@@ ize the country , we need to impose our la@@ ws and our better institutions . it 's not only in our interest ,
- but in the@@ irs .
- am i really hearing this ?
you sound like those colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s i keep meeting here in al@@ gi@@ ers !
i found more support for alger@@ ians in paris !
it 's easy to be pro-@@ ar@@ ab when you live in paris .
no one is on your side here , not gover@@ nor , army or sett@@ lers .
you 've already lost the battle .
i 'll be frank .
your new@@ sp@@ aper is je@@ o@@ par@@ diz@@ ing our collaboration with arab@@ s .
this might res@@ ult in a war .
there 's nothing left to be said .
let 's go .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how sad .
they 're ho@@ pel@@ ess .
mis@@ fortune has made them bitter .
i , had@@ j ham@@ ou , give you my horse as well as this sword with which i 've always fought fair@@ ly .
my life is in your hands .
you can have my son as a symbol of my sin@@ cer@@ ity .
may god help you decide our fate .
as a show of faith , i 'll let you keep your sword and horse , but i 'll take care of your son .
he can serve france when he 's older .
go back to your people and live pe@@ ac@@ efully .
drum roll !
i 'll only use it to defend my new friends if they 're att@@ acked .
i 'll see to it that he goes to a good school , so he can follow in his father 's foot@@ steps .
france 's flag is wide and can shel@@ ter all those who se@@ ek refu@@ ge and protection .
i spent 20 years of my life fighting , killing and dest@@ ro@@ ying .
i will now devo@@ te myself to peace and re@@ building .
i could take care of him and his studies .
under one condition .
which is ?
that you let him be mus@@ lim .
i swear to your god and mine to do so .
i 'll care for him as if he were my own .
how long will that boy stay in our home ?
i don 't know .
it 'll depend on his studies .
he e@@ ats with his hands . he doesn 't know how to use a fork .
he 'll learn .
this is what we 're here for .
you treat that child better than your own .
- good night , father .
good night , mother .
- good night , mother .
- good night , si@@ di baba .
- good night .
you 're not his father .
he 's only repe@@ ating what he 's heard .
you 've got a new night@@ go@@ wn .
where did you get it ?
i got some proper clothes .
why do you always hide that you 're kin@@ d-@@ hear@@ ted ?
- i want to see father . - go on .
- stop touching my things !
don 't mind him . he 's just mean .
you can play with me .
a pearl .
- a chair .
- a table .
- a girl .
- a pearl .
not a pearl .
a girl .
" a girl . "
a boy .
" a boy . " a girl . a boy .
go to bed .
but say your pr@@ ay@@ ers first .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with the@@ e , bles@@ sed art th@@ ou am@@ ong@@ st women ...
i was a medical officer , he , an interpre@@ ter .
it was a myth@@ ical alger@@ ia .
wanting arab@@ s to ab@@ ide by french rules would be a mistake .
they 're our part@@ ners , ...
the doc is a sp@@ y .
watch his every move .
- bring me all his letters .
- i 'm in love .
she 's here to sp@@ y on you .
that 's what the arab@@ s do !
this is a war of conqu@@ est and ex@@ termin@@ ation of arab@@ s .
some paris@@ ian new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers even wrote that we 're the barbar@@ ians .
alger@@ ia is and must remain a french province .
i hadn 't left the army , i had been kicked out for being republic@@ an and pro-@@ ar@@ ab .
after having con@@ quer@@ ed this land in the name of france , you will now farm it . and make it your new home !
can 't the cross and the cre@@ scent get along ?
they have different custom@@ s and val@@ ues .
they 're sav@@ ages !
you 'll all be shot !
you didn 't do too badly during these hard times ...
you want to bite the hand that fed you ?
you write for this rag ?
you sound like those colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s i keep meeting here in al@@ gi@@ ers !
it 's easy to be pro-@@ ar@@ ab when you live in paris .
i never betr@@ ayed you .
no one must ever know .
- he 's your son ?
- ours .
i couldn 't show my happiness .
i hope we won 't regret rais@@ ing this child as ours .
why would we ?
my son ais@@ sa looked so much like na@@ ou@@ el , whom i had loved so much .
what was in store for him ?
l '@@ algerie des chim@@ eres a dream of alger@@ ia 3 .
the ar@@ ab kingdom
you 're so handsome and strong , my son .
you 're the one who 's beautiful , mom .
- you are .
- no .
i 'm old now .
your father doesn 't look at me anymore .
- he took a new wife . very young .
- another one ?
since you joined the french , he took 2 w@@ ives to s@@ ire children .
i 'm not a good mare .
i only had one son .
you .
i think poly@@ gam@@ y is barbar@@ ic .
you sound like a fren@@ ch@@ man .
it 's the " ka@@ ida . " the proph@@ et had 9 w@@ ives .
- what 's the new wife 's name ?
- she 's from a noble clan .
she is je@@ alous of me .
wanted me sent to the kitchen .
no way !
you 're coming to al@@ gi@@ ers , to stay with me .
no !
be reas@@ su@@ red , son .
your father respec@@ ts and protec@@ ts me .
besides , i don 't want to be a bur@@ den on you .
it 's time for you to get married .
i chose a nice girl for you from a good family . very pretty and sweet .
six@@ teen . nice hips , not like me .
she 'll give you beautiful kids .
- no .
- you don 't want to get married ?
your brothers are already engag@@ ed , but your father won 't let them marry because you 're the el@@ dest .
i want to choose my own wife .
you love someone else .
yes .
a french woman ?
yes .
- who is she ?
- i can 't tell you .
not even to your mother ?
i don 't know if her parents will allow it .
- it 's because you 're an ar@@ ab .
- no .
it 's more complic@@ ated .
no , it isn 't .
be careful ais@@ sa .
the french are hypo@@ cr@@ ites .
they 're against poly@@ gam@@ y , but they all have mist@@ res@@ ses .
they won 't give you their daughter .
love can break all bar@@ riers .
you 're young .
time er@@ as@@ es all ... even love .
your old mother ... knows .
abdallah seems to be manag@@ ing well .
i 'm not used to it anymore .
you can study here .
i slowly built up a nice library .
i even found manus@@ crip@@ ts that belong@@ ed to emir ab@@ del@@ kader .
may god protect him in ex@@ ile .
france st@@ ole you from us , ais@@ sa .
you forgot that you gave me to france .
it made me into an officer .
it 's like a mother to me .
there are 2 france , ais@@ sa .
that 's what i learned .
in paris , france made you an officer and fre@@ ed ital@@ y . here , france ke@@ eps alger@@ ia under its yo@@ ke .
the gover@@ nor is se@@ iz@@ ing our land to give to the colon@@ ists .
what do they want ?
her@@ d us in the sahara ?
i 'm certain napoleon iii is against con@@ fin@@ ement .
five trib@@ al el@@ ders and i are to meet him in comp@@ ie@@ gne .
we 'll see if he 's on our side .
- we must trust him .
- may god hear you ... and inspire him truth and justice .
ais@@ sa was back .
what joy to see my son again after 3 years of absence , now a grown man covered in glory under the french bann@@ er .
- at mag@@ enta and sol@@ fer@@ ino ?
- yes .
- you lucky devil . - emile .
war is no joke , except for kings and emper@@ ors . victory in sol@@ fer@@ ino cost thous@@ ands of lives .
yes , but we saved the itali@@ ans from austri@@ an occupation .
what a beautiful uniform .
you look handsome .
- dinner is ready .
- let 's go .
tell us all about it .
to ais@@ sa .
i looked at ais@@ sa .
he was proof that one could be a good fren@@ ch@@ man and a good a mus@@ lim .
did he em@@ body the succes@@ s@@ ful union of the east and the west ?
i started to believe in it again .
i don 't like the way ais@@ sa looks at jeanne .
- going out ?
with those go@@ o go@@ o eyes of his .
- didn 't you notice ?
- no . why ?
- suppose he 's in love with her .
- what are you talking about ?
i hope we won 't regret rais@@ ing this child as ours .
on the contr@@ ary .
he 's the perfect ex@@ ample of integration .
- he 's like a fren@@ ch@@ man .
- perhaps . but he isn 't .
he is by the blood he spil@@ led , fighting for france .
that 's fine , but i don 't want him to touch my daughter .
don 't worry .
he 's staying in town and wants to be his own man .
i hope so .
i have something to tell you , jeanne .
i love war .
i discovered a new hom@@ eland :
in the army , bar@@ riers fall .
i 'm not a mus@@ lim among cathol@@ ics or an ar@@ ab among french .
i 'm a soldier among soldiers . all equ@@ al before death .
only one rule : courage .
- do you understand ?
- i don 't know . it 's a male world where women have no place .
i 'm bo@@ red , ais@@ sa .
i need to do something use@@ ful , excit@@ ing , unique .
sometimes i en@@ vy the fate of colon@@ ist women .
it 's dangerous but so excit@@ ing .
jeanne . will you marry me ?
of course .
when we were little , we said we 'd get married .
will your parents let their daughter marry a mus@@ lim ?
i don 't know about dad .
mother won 't .
but i don 't care .
- where is miss jeanne ?
- outside .
how are you feeling ?
well .
why ?
you 've been odd , lat@@ ely .
you can trust me .
among women , we can understand each other .
nothing is trou@@ bling me .
a mother feels such things .
you 're a big girl , jeanne .
it 's time to think about your future .
there 're many young offic@@ ers from good famili@@ es in al@@ gi@@ ers .
i 'll invite some for you to meet .
- i 'm not in a hurry to marry .
- then you 'll be an old ma@@ id .
mother !
what are you driving at ?
i don 't want you to fall for just anyone .
that 's all .
- that 's what it is . - yes .
that 's what it is .
you 've changed since ais@@ sa 's return .
- you have a soft spot for him .
- not a soft spot .
we 're in love .
we want to get married .
what ?
marry an ar@@ ab ?
a mus@@ lim ?
no way !
marriage is something serious .
you marry someone with the same religion and background .
i for@@ bid you to see this boy .
understood ?
i for@@ bid you .
understood ?
yes .
- i knew it .
i told you . - thank you .
and you thought they were like brother and sister .
i 'll call the police if he sets foot in here again .
what 's gotten into you ?
we raised him as one or ours .
unfortunately , yes .
anyway you always had a soft spot for him .
- i don 't want him to touch her .
he won 't have the chance anyway .
his regiment is leaving for france , then mexico .
- when ?
- i don 't know .
the emper@@ or wants maximilian of austria in mexico .
very good .
how can you say that .
it 's war over there .
just as well .
maybe he 'll get killed .
is jeanne there ?
get out !
beat it !
never set foot in this house !
go away !
- you had no right to stop him .
- you do what you 're told .
you can 't stop me .
i 'll leave , come what may .
i 'll join him , become a mus@@ lim if need be .
- go to your room !
- don 't touch me !
don 't you ever , again .
- what are you doing here ?
- i escaped from home .
- are you out of your mind ?
- i came to say goodbye .
- what are you doing ?
- i want to be yours .
i can 't believe it !
look at this !
see the news ?
your circum@@ cis@@ ed pal is taking 5 el@@ ders to see the emper@@ or .
- did you know ?
- no .
- we 're not close anymore .
- they are plo@@ t@@ ting in comp@@ ie@@ gne , with general fle@@ ury and the saint-@@ sim@@ oni@@ ans .
- what do they want ?
- arab@@ ize us .
said , come with me .
take care of yourself !
don 't worry .
this trip is very important for me .
the emper@@ or has decided .
he read my books .
he plans a new alger@@ ia polic@@ y , my polic@@ y .
can you understand that ?
- you 'll see the kids at least . - of course .
i 'll write every day and tell you what 's happening .
" dear bahia , you can 't imagine how lav@@ ish@@ ly
" the emper@@ or received our ar@@ ab friends at comp@@ ie@@ gne . "
" everything is so wonderful .
" the emper@@ or held long tal@@ ks with the el@@ ders .
" he promised complete equ@@ ality between europe@@ ans and arab@@ s .
" ' that 's but fair , honor@@ able and right , ' he told them . " who were de@@ ligh@@ ted , you can imagine .
" it 's truly a revolution . "
" the nat@@ ive chie@@ fs gave the emper@@ or a black stal@@ lion , " a magn@@ ific@@ ent off@@ spring of the famous go@@ dol@@ ph@@ in arab@@ ian , " father of all thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ bre@@ ds .
" his majest@@ y has a special place for it .
" ' we 'll be able to com@@ pete with the british , ' gen@@ . fle@@ ury said .
" her majest@@ y the em@@ press and the imperial prince " showed our friends consider@@ ation and appreci@@ ation .
" the emper@@ or recognized ais@@ sa , whom he decor@@ ated at mag@@ enta . " he also introduc@@ ed him to the em@@ press .
" his father , had@@ j ham@@ ou , was filled with pride .
" finally , his majest@@ y did me the honor
" to explain in detail his project to our friends " to turn alger@@ ia into an ar@@ ab kingdom . "
dear friends , here 's the man whose works have insp@@ i@@ red the emper@@ or 's polic@@ y .
no one can better explain it to you .
i 'll give him the floor .
the emper@@ or asked me to tell you that we didn 't come to alger@@ ia to op@@ press or pl@@ under , but to bring you the bles@@ s@@ ings of civiliz@@ ation .
he wants to make alger@@ ia an ar@@ ab kingdom .
hen@@ ce@@ forth , he 'll protect you , as he does the french .
he is both emper@@ or of the french and king of the arab@@ s .
- in practice , what does it mean ?
- fir@@ st@@ ly ... the emper@@ or will end the con@@ fin@@ ement polic@@ y .
your title to tradition@@ al trib@@ al lands will be recognized .
no more desp@@ oli@@ ation .
- will land be ours ?
- it will bel@@ ong to the trib@@ es .
later , everyone will have a share .
secon@@ dly ... following the proclam@@ ation of full europe@@ an-@@ ar@@ ab equ@@ ality , the emper@@ or shall grant french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship to je@@ ws and arab@@ s who so desire .
we know france br@@ ings progress and we are grateful .
but we 'd rather live according to our own la@@ ws and custom@@ s .
for us muslim@@ s , religion rules everything .
you know that .
the kor@@ an is our civil code , our book of science and medicine , the word of god .
i assure you , all your views will be taken into account .
let us begin .
what 's your impression ?
they are de@@ ligh@@ ted by their stay .
they were also char@@ med by his majest@@ y .
i think they 'll agree with the ar@@ ab kingdom model , except for si kad@@ our , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
we have to handle him carefully .
he 's very influ@@ enti@@ al in kab@@ y@@ lia .
in any event , it 's imper@@ ative for his majest@@ y to come to alger@@ ia to laun@@ ch his polic@@ y .
it will provo@@ ke colon@@ ist and military opposition .
he 'll come .
it 's only a question of tim@@ ing .
if pel@@ is@@ sier doesn 't like it , we 'll re@@ place him .
there you are .
tal@@ ab@@ ot has been waiting for you for half an hour .
- paul@@ in , i 'm happy to see you .
- od@@ il@@ on .
- what are you doing in al@@ gi@@ ers ?
- big news , old pal .
next week , we 'll be lay@@ ing down the last rail@@ road track . we 're also inaugur@@ ating the new bli@@ da station .
mar@@ sha@@ l pel@@ is@@ sier ...
everyone will be there .
i hope you 'll write a nice article .
is the paper yours ?
i bought 50 % from rou@@ car@@ ies , but it 's not doing well .
no .
i have to meet pel@@ is@@ sier .
i gave rou@@ car@@ ies all the details .
- see you later at the cafe .
- agreed .
is mr. tal@@ ab@@ ot a saint-@@ sim@@ on@@ ian ?
i heard you were too .
does this sec@@ t still ex@@ ist ?
they 're scat@@ tered , but still have influence at the court , among university students and bank@@ ers .
here 's the article . lat@@ ely , they 've become like the fre@@ em@@ as@@ ons .
what do they want ?
the uto@@ pi@@ ans like to@@ us@@ saint believe in santa cl@@ aus .
the others believe in progress , thinking that with money , fac@@ tor@@ ies , mines and rail@@ roads , they can sol@@ ve everything .
the parado@@ x is that they began as soci@@ alist@@ s , and now they 're big cap@@ itali@@ sts .
i saw hel@@ ie yesterday .
we spoke about you and old times .
it seems you had a falling out ?
we have nothing to say to each other .
he 's gen@@ . fle@@ ury 's man . he heads the pro-@@ ar@@ ab camp that wants to sell out alger@@ ia .
we dis@@ agree about the future of this country .
you 're both wrong .
hel@@ ie thinks that the french and arab@@ s can live as equ@@ als .
you want to turn them into fren@@ ch@@ men .
that 's an il@@ lusion .
and you ?
what 's your solution ? i ... build .
i build rail@@ roads and roads , dig the ground , plant trees .
i re@@ present progress , a sort of char@@ ity .
i deal with reality , not dreams .
do you know what arab@@ s say about your rail@@ road ?
" al-@@ rab@@ at she@@ it@@ an , " the devil 's car@@ t .
i 'm hungry .
let 's have lunch .
good piece , benjamin !
you 'll do the next on the army 's anti-@@ con@@ fin@@ ement action .
- look !
nice lay@@ out .
- yes .
boy , come here .
it 's time i tell him .
i have bad news .
- i can guess .
- i can 't pay you .
you haven 't paid him in 2 months .
it 's not my fault if we don 't have money .
half the colon@@ ists are span@@ ish and can 't read french .
- i got an idea .
- really ?
struck gold ?
- maybe .
- serious ?
- where ?
- here in al@@ gi@@ ers . - what is it ?
- my dad 's pock@@ ets .
we 're always ready to help our french friends .
from the start of conqu@@ est we offered france our services .
we know the tur@@ ks and arab@@ s well , mr. hubert .
we 've de@@ alt with them for 2 centur@@ ies , since my anc@@ est@@ ors came from leg@@ horn to trade between barbar@@ y coast pirates and itali@@ an mer@@ ch@@ ants .
please , sit down .
we know your father advis@@ es gen@@ . bu@@ ge@@ aud on ar@@ ab affa@@ irs .
benjamin told me about your paper 's financial diffic@@ ulti@@ es .
that shouldn 't be a problem . my el@@ dest son david , who runs our bank , can help you .
did you hear me ?
with a special rate for friends .
thank you very much . let me also say how much we appreciate benjamin 's intelligence , skil@@ ls and tal@@ ents .
yes , benjamin .
i sent him to law school in montpellier . it cost a bun@@ dle , but we wanted him to be our law@@ yer .
but in france , he caught the polit@@ ical bug .
polit@@ ics se@@ als the fate of nations .
it 's very important .
trade is saf@@ er .
business is business , whoever is in power .
since your paper de@@ als with polit@@ ics , i 've a favor to ask .
please , tell me .
as head of the je@@ wish council , i 'm host to a french member of par@@ li@@ ament who is concerned about our small community . his name is adol@@ phe cre@@ mieux .
i hope he gets french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship for alger@@ ian je@@ ws .
i thought you weren 't interested in polit@@ ics .
it 's , let 's say , about religion .
we 'll be glad to interview him .
tell him to come to the paper .
thank you .
actually , thank you for what you 're doing for the paper .
it 's for a good cause , that of a french alger@@ ia where je@@ ws will play an important role .
since that is the case , could you ar@@ range a meeting between myself as head of the je@@ wish council , and the gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general ?
the army and i aren 't ...
you can see to it with my son daniel .
perhaps .
- see you tomorrow ... 8 am ?
- yes .
bahia ?
- had a good trip ?
- a bit long .
- i missed you .
- you too . - come !
- you 're still as beautiful .
tell me about the kids .
they 're well .
they send their love and miss you .
ahmed got his ph@@ .@@ d. in law with hon@@ ors .
good !
now he can practice in al@@ gi@@ ers .
- i 'm not sure he wants to .
- you 'll get upset .
- tell me !
he thinks he won 't make it in al@@ gi@@ ers .
he 's decided to stay in paris and changed his name .
- he now calls himself ame@@ dee .
- my son ahmed ?
don 't be upset !
i don 't like it , but i can understand him .
in paris , an ar@@ ab name st@@ icks out like a tur@@ ban .
many je@@ ws and pol@@ es took french names .
he won 't be the first .
then , why aren 't french taking ar@@ ab names here ?
it 's a religi@@ ous thing .
the french take saints ' names .
- i won 't have it .
- bahia !
i 'll write him what i think .
calm down .
things will change .
ahmed might too .
the emper@@ or accepted our pro@@ pos@@ als .
alger@@ ia will be an ar@@ ab kingdom with equ@@ al cit@@ iz@@ ens .
it will be a tou@@ gh sell .
everyone is against you .
- you must be hungry .
- a bit .
mar@@ sha@@ l pel@@ is@@ sier will see you .
- some port as you wait ?
- no , thanks .
i don 't drink .
a ci@@ gar ?
i don 't smoke .
besides , it 's ram@@ adan .
sorry !
i forgot .
the gover@@ nor is in a fou@@ l mood .
he got orders from paris , he doesn 't like .
i think i know what they are .
so you 're here .
did you put all this non@@ sense in his majest@@ y 's head ?
my respec@@ ts , mar@@ sha@@ l .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
don 't be so co@@ y !
this letter of instruc@@ tions from his majest@@ y ,
which he person@@ ally signed .
it tal@@ ks about the end of the con@@ fin@@ ement polic@@ y , about the ar@@ ab kingdom ,
and arab@@ -@@ european equ@@ ality .
did you put him up to it ?
it 's full of your books ' sub@@ ver@@ sive language ... and that of your friends , fle@@ ury , david ...
you flat@@ ter me thinking i have such influence on his majest@@ y .
no doub@@ let@@ al@@ k .
hear this , little fellow !
i was on the beach when we landed .
i didn 't give 30 years of my life to this country to see it given to the arab@@ s who 'll mess it up .
i won 't ever accept that !
do you hear me ?
ever !
may i re@@ mind you , sir . the country belong@@ s to the arab@@ s .
no more .
we took it with our blood .
and especially with the@@ irs .
listen , to@@ us@@ saint !
we aren 't dre@@ amer@@ s , vision@@ aries .
we build .
we 're turning alger@@ ia into a modern country bringing comfort to the colon@@ ists and progress to the nat@@ ives .
there is no other vi@@ able plan .
all else is id@@ le talk for frustr@@ ated intellectu@@ als a bit like you .
you won 't build anything without the alger@@ ians .
to@@ us@@ saint ...
you might be the smar@@ test , but i war@@ n you ... i shall stop you .
god be my wit@@ ness ! i 'm the strong@@ est .
i too have connec@@ tions in the court .
perhaps you forget that my wife is the em@@ press ' cousin .
- may i go , mar@@ sha@@ l ?
- get out !
and don 't get in my way or you 'll regret it .
my respec@@ ts , mar@@ sha@@ l .
what arro@@ gan@@ ce !
i asked the emper@@ or to re@@ move this good@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ nothing .
he 's general fle@@ ury 's man and he 's backed by the emper@@ or .
by jo@@ ve , we 'll see who 's the strong@@ est .
keep your smooth talk for paris .
when we came here , there was nothing but desert , sw@@ amp@@ s , f@@ lies and d@@ warf palms .
one third of us died of chol@@ era .
one third gave up and rent@@ ed the land to the arab@@ s .
we are the last third .
we survi@@ ved mas@@ sac@@ res , disease , dro@@ ught , gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers .
we won 't give in to your ar@@ ab kingdom .
listen ! why end con@@ fin@@ ement ?
alger@@ ia has 3.5 million people . it can feed 20 .
we have 12 million hectar@@ es of un@@ cultiv@@ ated land . and you want to stop colon@@ iz@@ ation .
thous@@ ands of colon@@ ists can come .
why leave good land to the arab@@ s ?
either their her@@ ds destroy it , or they badly farm it .
- we produce 6 times they do .
- he 's right .
it 's our land .
we created a new france here .
friends , the land belong@@ s to the nat@@ ives , the colon@@ ists and the army .
the emper@@ or declar@@ ed it an ar@@ ab kingdom , a european colon@@ y and a military camp .
ar@@ rant non@@ sense .
it 's crystal clear to me .
first , we 're not your friends , to@@ us@@ saint . rul@@ ing means cho@@ os@@ ing .
it 's either us or them .
tell your emper@@ or that no one will throw us out .
this is our home .
our enem@@ ies want to give power to the arab@@ s .
if they win , that 'll tol@@ l the bell for us .
- do you want to become ar@@ ab ?
we 'll remain french . we won 't bow to napoleon the pun@@ y ... king of the arab@@ s !
we are now 200,000 europe@@ ans .
we can 't be dis@@ missed .
we 've ral@@ lied the colon@@ ists , and all true republic@@ ans :
pr@@ inter@@ s , mas@@ ons , mer@@ ch@@ ants , and architec@@ ts .
- are the je@@ ws with us ?
- of course . they might not dare come out , but i 'm here .
we 'll mobili@@ ze the women and demonstr@@ ate with you .
down with the emper@@ or !
long live the republic !
we had a fe@@ ver@@ ish month .
al@@ gi@@ ers was under siege . every day , people heard our call . women too .
- french alger@@ ia !
french alger@@ ia ! - present arms !
get ready !
let us through .
we 're going to the government house .
- the street is closed .
- let us through !
a@@ im !
- forward !
- french alger@@ ia !
take it easy !
i 'm not un@@ happy about the protest@@ s .
they show paris the fut@@ il@@ ity of its abandon@@ ment polic@@ y .
even women are getting into the act .
that 's too much .
these people are ho@@ the@@ ads a bit quick@@ -@@ temper@@ ed , but they cool down as quickly .
don 't forget !
we 're south of marseille .
anyway , make sure the tro@@ ops aren 't trig@@ ger@@ -@@ happy .
break some skul@@ ls if you must , but no fire .
that 's an order .
i don 't want any violence .
understood ?
no more violence .
it cool@@ ed down after a month .
mar@@ . pel@@ is@@ sier died from p@@ neum@@ onia . the ar@@ ab kingdom polic@@ y had its first set@@ back .
neither je@@ ws nor arab@@ s wanted to give up their special status in exchange for french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship .
only 200 arab@@ s out of 3 million app@@ lied for it . ais@@ sa was one of them and had his own reasons .
- thanks but i don 't drink .
- of course .
i came to ask you for jeanne 's hand , offici@@ ally .
my regiment leaves for mexico and we would like to be engag@@ ed before i leave .
ais@@ sa . you and jeanne can@@ not marry .
why ?
you 're too young , practically brother and sister .
a kab@@ yle pro@@ ver@@ b says , " marry within your tri@@ be ,
" within your village , and if possible , within your family . "
you bel@@ ong to different worl@@ ds .
what ?
i 'm french now .
yes , but you 're also mus@@ lim .
do you know the obst@@ acles you 'll be facing ?
jeanne will want a church wedding .
what will your family say ?
- there 're other mixed cou@@ ples .
- they 're the exception .
your friend hel@@ ie to@@ us@@ saint married a mus@@ lim woman .
yes , but he conver@@ ted , and now stands dis@@ ow@@ ned by his family .
listen !
let 's not beat around the bush . is it yes or no ?
ais@@ sa . i 'd like to say yes but it 's impossible .
believe me .
trust me .
it 's no , then .
what if we elop@@ ed without your per@@ mission ?
i for@@ bid you .
i get it .
my ar@@ ab blood was accep@@ table on the battle@@ field .
in paris , they saw fit to grant me french cit@@ iz@@ en@@ ship .
but they forgot to tell me it was a second class pas@@ sport , because here in al@@ gi@@ ers , i 'm always an out@@ si@@ der , a nat@@ ive .
even for you .
it 's all clear now .
i 'll wait for you .
when you return , i 'll be of age .
i 'll leave home .
we 'll marry and live in france .
we still have to wait .
i 'll wait for as long as it takes .
napoleon iii came to alger@@ ia twice to pro@@ claim himself king of the arab@@ s .
he was de@@ ligh@@ ted .
he ate o@@ str@@ ich eg@@ gs , ro@@ ast@@ ed gaz@@ elle and lion meat .
everywhere , huge ar@@ ab crow@@ ds che@@ ered him .
our paper had to con@@ cede his great succes@@ s , organiz@@ ed , it must be said , by the ar@@ ab office .
hel@@ ie acted as his interpre@@ ter thro@@ ugh@@ out his stay .
it was his hour of glory .
he thought he 'd seen the dawn of the ar@@ ab kingdom . history decided otherwise .
look at this !
four years of dro@@ ught , fam@@ ine , chol@@ era , and gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers .
all at once in just 4 years .
look !
they 're eating grass , ro@@ ots and even leaves .
people are dropping like f@@ lies from hunger and chol@@ era .
where are the french doc@@ tors ?
chol@@ era isn 't rac@@ ist . fren@@ ch@@ men have died from it too .
even bu@@ ge@@ aud died from it in paris .
did you see how the pe@@ as@@ ant treated me ?
when you privat@@ ized collec@@ tive land , you broke up the tri@@ be ,
it 's the price of progress and of a fa@@ i@@ rer , modern society .
do you know what they did with the ar@@ id land you gave them ?
they sol@@ d it to the colon@@ ists for a pit@@ tan@@ ce .
people here are super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous .
they 're saying the ar@@ ab kingdom has the evil eye .
i 'm sorry , but all you 've done for us is turning against us .
all the same , you can 't blame us for dro@@ ught , gras@@ sho@@ p@@ pers , and disease .
bad luck ho@@ unds us .
people say it 's god 's ven@@ ge@@ ance because we didn 't defend our land against the in@@ fi@@ del@@ s .
tell the gover@@ nor that if france does nothing , there 'll be war .
- war@@ n him .
- i will .
tell him that i lost a son ... to chol@@ era , and that my young@@ est might go into the mountains .
- you know what that means ?
- how is she ?
- it 's chol@@ era .
quick . she 's being waiting for you for 2 days .
my son ... apple of my eye .
- you came to say far@@ e@@ well .
- i 'm here .
you 'll pull through .
it 's too late .
god p@@ icks the hour and mine has come .
i 've a secret to tell you .
a secret ?
yes , ais@@ sa . one that i 've carried in my heart since you were born .
od@@ il@@ on is your father .
you must@@ n 't marry jeanne .
forgive me , ais@@ sa !
i mixed in@@ fi@@ del blood ... with that of the true warriors of the faith .
i was young , a har@@ em slave .
during the taf@@ na peace ,
od@@ il@@ on was ab@@ del@@ kader 's doctor .
you were born after that .
had@@ j ham@@ ou raised you . he taught you to walk , to ride a horse , and to use a sword and rif@@ le .
he taught you right from wrong , and courage .
he taught you the true religion .
he 's your father too .
stay with me !
stay !
i had made a promise .
i will always be fond of jeanne .
promise me never to tell her .
i promise .
if it does , i 'll fight by your side .
you can 't , ais@@ sa .
that 'd give you away .
have you for@@ sak@@ en your religion ?
i haven 't .
one day , france will allow its cit@@ iz@@ ens to be cathol@@ ic , je@@ wish or mus@@ lim .
france ... maybe .
but we won 't here , son , not on mus@@ lim so@@ il .
you 're french now .
you must leave and ful@@ fill your destiny .
i am french .
but my heart will forever be in alger@@ ia .
you 're hiding something .
what 's going on ?
is it another woman ?
is that it ?
be honest .
i 'm getting married .
what ?
my mother has chosen my future wife .
i can@@ not refuse .
it 's tradition , you see .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't believe you .
i don 't care .
what 'll you do , all alone in paris ?
where will you stay ?
with aunt ines .
i 'll take a job as a nurse .
i 'll treat the wo@@ unded on the front .
i 'll defend france .
you 're lying .
you want to go with him .
you want to be with your ar@@ ab !
throwing yourself at him like that !
how dare you ?
look at yourself .
a kab@@ yle rap@@ ed your grandmother !
you 're an ar@@ ab too !
the bad arab@@ s like rap@@ ing women like you !
jeanne ...
our ar@@ mi@@ es are getting defe@@ ated everywhere :
wis@@ sem@@ bourg , reich@@ sho@@ ff@@ en-@@ fro@@ esch@@ wil@@ ler ...
what a dis@@ grace !
what posses@@ sed the emper@@ or to w@@ age war on prussia ?
bismarck was waiting for it .
new head@@ line !
the emper@@ or was cap@@ tured and ab@@ di@@ cated .
gamb@@ etta declar@@ ed a new republic .
a new republic , my friends !
follow me !
said ? i couldn 't believe it .
the emper@@ or had been cap@@ tured .
they 'd declar@@ ed a new republic .
my old dream had finally come true !
i 'm the lieutenant commander !
you should leave before my friends get here .
listen to them . they 're jubil@@ ant .
don 't be a hero , it 's best you fle@@ e .
where 's to@@ us@@ saint ?
where 's that sly fox ?
van@@ ished .
we 'll get him so@@ oner or later .
while the french are fighting each other ,
- let 's throw them into the sea .
we must save the ar@@ ab kingdom .
they say they 're republic@@ ans , but you know them .
they 're colon@@ i@@ alist@@ s , arab@@ op@@ ho@@ bes ...
let 's ro@@ use the trib@@ es and drive the french out !
- co@@ wards !
- listen to me !
we 've talked enough .
i 'll ro@@ use my tro@@ ops and fight !
come with me to oran , bahia .
you can 't stay in al@@ gi@@ ers .
bahia ...
i beg you ...
do this for me .
it 's too dangerous here .
i 'll try to go to paris on my own .
meet me there .
i love you .
the french government has f@@ led to tours .
by god , france is collap@@ sing !
we should declare indepen@@ dence .
send us gar@@ i@@ bal@@ di and alger@@ ia will take care of itself , just like ital@@ y .
you want us to fight 3 million arab@@ s all by our@@ selves ?
- what are the other wi@@ res ?
- nothing important .
say , what do you think of ...
what 's wrong ?
" on the front , the incredi@@ ble bra@@ very " of the ' chas@@ seurs d '@@ afrique , ' alger@@ ian soldiers and z@@ ou@@ aves ,
" cost them de@@ arly .
" the second ' tur@@ cos ' was bled dry .
" its offic@@ ers were killed in action . "
shit .
the second " tur@@ cos ... " that 's ais@@ sa 's regiment !
friends ...
military rule is over .
alger@@ ia has been split into 3 depart@@ ments gover@@ ned by french law .
the depart@@ ments will be run by a prefec@@ t and by members of par@@ li@@ ament .
the gover@@ nor@@ -@@ general must now be a ci@@ vili@@ an , under the minist@@ ry of the interior .
we 've won , my friends !
alger@@ ia is both ci@@ vili@@ an and french !
a french alger@@ ia !
- long live french alger@@ ia !
- wait . sett@@ le down . there 's more .
the 33@@ ,000 alger@@ ian je@@ ws are now automat@@ ically french .
- will we be allowed to vote ?
- of course .
- what about the arab@@ s ?
- not for now . ph@@ ew !
my heart stopped .
shut up !
thous@@ ands of " tur@@ cos " and z@@ ou@@ aves died on the battle@@ field . they vo@@ ted with their blood .
a minute of silence for our mus@@ lim brothers who died for france .
why did you keep that from me ?
i had made a promise .
how could you keep such a secret to yourself this long ?
" dear father , " you reading this letter means i was killed in action . "
" don 't cry .
" i 'll glad@@ ly give france the life you 've given me " that has nothing left in store for me .
" i will finally rest in peace " under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eye of the 2 gods who rul@@ ed " over my life and death . "
" the al@@ migh@@ ty god of the arab@@ s , who control@@ s good and evil " and the mer@@ ci@@ ful christian god " who can forgive every sin . "
" i 'm writing you to re@@ mind you of your promise . "
" jeanne ... " must never find out . "
" never . "
" far@@ e@@ well .
" your son , ais@@ sa . "
what happened ?
why did he rej@@ ect me ?
hey ar@@ ab !
stay where you are !
don 't move , ar@@ ab !
- yes ?
- open up !
i didn 't know where else to go .
come in .
oh , it 's you .
where 's bahia ?
she went to oran with her father .
why didn 't you take her with you ?
i 'd have looked after her .
have you e@@ aten ?
no .
i 'm not hungry .
i 'll go make your bed .
you can 't stay in alger@@ ia .
they 'll kill you .
you can spend the night here . tomorrow , i 'll put you on a boat to sp@@ ain .
i paid half already .
give them the rest when you arrive .
this is a saf@@ e-@@ conduc@@ t .
just in case .
and a pist@@ ol .
it could come in hand@@ y .
thank you .
- what a beautiful country .
- our country .
- what happened to us , od@@ il@@ on ?
- life .
do you remember men@@ il@@ mon@@ tant ?
unit@@ ing the east and the west ?
why did you for@@ sake our ide@@ als ?
they were uto@@ pi@@ an .
the ar@@ ab kingdom is not uto@@ pi@@ an .
just the opposite . it 's re@@ alist@@ ic .
you 'll see it too one day .
why do you force your ide@@ als on me ?
mine are as good as yours .
i want this land to become a part of france , of republic@@ an france . freedom , equ@@ ality , frat@@ ern@@ ity .
freedom ? or the right for the strong to op@@ press the weak !
not neces@@ sar@@ ily .
republic@@ an education will turn these arab@@ s into good french cit@@ iz@@ ens .
it 'll take time , but i 'm opti@@ mist@@ ic .
they should become good alger@@ ian cit@@ iz@@ ens , instead !
you 're bound to fa@@ il !
the future will decide .
- god will decide .
what happened to to@@ us@@ saint ?
i never saw him again .
i 'm told he went back to alger@@ ia .
how come ?
he followed his own path , alone , which doesn 't surprise me .
you never saw him again ?
wasn 't he a friend ?
you see , we never par@@ ted ways .
you know , we need uto@@ pi@@ ans , dre@@ amer@@ s .
the world couldn 't ex@@ ist without them .
excuse me , i must go now .
it 's rather cold in here , wouldn 't you agree ?
it is .
after a while , the cold gets to you .
it 's just awful .

i 'm your new partner , owen maestro .
ugh !
ro@@ o@@ kie move , maestro . never let your guard down like that .
but section 19 / a of the rule book says --
the rule book 's never been out on the streets .
sometimes , you got to bend the rules .
su@@ cker punch !
su@@ cker punch ! but that 's not what we learned at the academy .
the academy doesn 't know crap .
just ask the rule book . release .
so , what 's our as@@ sign@@ ment ?
the childr@@ ens hospital mur@@ ders .
they just found a four@@ th vic@@ tim de@@ capit@@ ated like the others .
four de@@ capit@@ ations , huh ?
these victi@@ ms sound like the beatles of de@@ capit@@ ations .
the fa@@ b four -- without heads .
i mean i 've heard of " help , " but this is ridiculous .
mo@@ p to@@ ps ? how about no to@@ ps ?
you know that song " come together " ?
well , this is like " come apart . "
you know .
" i want to hold my head . "
... " on , so it doesn 't get cut off . "
this band is not gon@@ na have the talking heads for an opening act .
- let 's go .
which one of you is in charge ?
well , that couldn 't be me .
the only thing i 'm in charge of is this .
hey , uh , boss !
- these guys want to talk to you .
- okay . okay , i 'll talk to you later .
hi . i 'm brad len@@ dr@@ icks .
i 'm the head param@@ edi@@ c .
what do you want ?
it 's about the recent kil@@ lings at the hospital .
you mean the ones due to the ser@@ ial killer or medical neg@@ li@@ gence ?
let 's save the s@@ nap@@ s for " yo mtv s@@ nap@@ s . "
word is the param@@ edi@@ cs are the eyes and ears of the hospital .
brad can 't help you .
no , he 's always been myster@@ iously missing whenever a murder happened .
if you 'll excuse me , i have to go stand over there .
if you ask me , brad 's glad all those guys got off@@ ed .
see , he 's been in love with cat for years , but she refus@@ es to go out with him .
and now he 's got a clear playing field .
a clearly stat@@ ed motive .
still , we need some solid evidence .
all we have on the guy is what this bald as@@ sh@@ ole told us .
no off@@ ense -- i 'm sure you have some really great qualit@@ ies , too .
i 'm just going off of first impres@@ sions .
you know , i 've always wanted to be a doctor .
ever since i gradu@@ ated medical school .
so , did you ever become a doctor ?
yeah . i 've been a doctor for 15 years .
oh , yeah , right .
that is not good enough , okay ?
i want these ti@@ res to be white !
there 's more ur@@ ine where this came from .
there 's that param@@ edi@@ c .
how do we know he was telling the truth 15 years ago ?
chet mand@@ van@@ te@@ us@@ sen ?
just do it better next time .
we want to talk to you about the murder of cat 's most recent boyfriend .
you 've done pretty well for yourself , haven 't you , mand@@ van@@ te@@ us@@ sen ?
you 're head param@@ edi@@ c now , your own ambul@@ ance , your own assistant .
maybe . doesn 't mean i killed cat 's boyfriend .
it could have been any@@ body .
what about former secre@@ tary of state con@@ dol@@ e@@ ez@@ za rice ?
okay . not her .
one down .
about 6 bil@@ lion to go .
we need the personnel records on everyone who 's worked here in the past 15 years .
i 'm sorry .
any files over 14 years old are conver@@ ted into micro@@ film and then shi@@ pped to our stor@@ age facil@@ ity in the deep south where they are then destroy@@ ed .
i wish i could be more hel@@ p@@ ful .
_
turn up anything ?
and lots of it .
just like we found at each of the other murder scenes .
yeah , and according to the lab , all the sem@@ en samp@@ les came from the same person , probably male .
i would say definitely male .
my guess is len@@ dr@@ icks , but we can 't know without a samp@@ le of his sem@@ en .
detective ?
i 'm on it .
i like your hair@@ cut .
thank you .
got it .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
this is a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge dev@@ ice used to identi@@ fy dna .
welcome to the future , my friend .
and now i 'll just call the lab .
what is that , some kind of time machine ?
it 's the new motor@@ ola clam@@ shell , brig@@ gs .
you never seen a cell@@ phone ?
sure , but if i need to call someone , i 'll use a pay phone .
this is more than just a phone , partner .
look -- time and date .
good god .
i guess it is a time and date machine .
we got a match .
- chet , are you cle@@ aning that gur@@ ney ?
- yes , sir ! hold it right there .
you 're under ar@@ rest for the murder of --
w@@ hoa ! i want to talk to a law@@ yer !
the only law@@ yer you 'll be talking to is one ap@@ pointed to you by the court .
vet@@ eran move , maestro .
wrong seat .
could you get in the back , please ?
oh . there we go .
watch your head .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , girls .
zoe , thank you so much for your note .
that was so sweet .
len@@ dr@@ icks .
last time we saw you , you were a man .
what ?
shut up !
i made a deal with the district at@@ tor@@ ney to be sent to the women 's prison --
better food , less athle@@ te 's foot , and the sex is amazing .
what ? anything goes !
we think your old assistant chet may be co@@ py@@ cat@@ ting you .
i didn 't do it in the first place .
wait . what ?
your sem@@ en was found at every crime scene .
sem@@ en , sem@@ en , sem@@ en , sem@@ en !
i used to ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ e in the clo@@ sets at work .
is that a crime ?
in iraq , yes , and also here .
okay , all i ask is that when you find this guy , you clear my name .
except for the ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ ing part .
i did do that , and i want that credit .
look at us , huh ?
working a case , just like the first day we met .
actually ... it 's time i told you about the real first day we met .
what 's happening ?
the year was 1992 .
during my junior year at ober@@ lin , i took a par@@ t-@@ time job at a veterin@@ ary hospital -- the night shift .
it was just me and the animals .
this is where he figures out who the mur@@ derer is .
as the months progres@@ sed , i had to figure out a way to pass the time ...
you stupid ape .
you missed a straight di@@ agon@@ al move .
... but i was bo@@ red , so , of course , i started dres@@ sing up this one bab@@ oon in human clothes .
just one more thing .
my name is chance brig@@ gs .
- very good .
- brig@@ gs . i own you .
own .
me owen .
sure .
you owen .
i 'm gon@@ na call you owen .
owen ! that 's right .
- owen .
- you owen !
- me owen !
- you owen .
you were a mon@@ key .
that expl@@ ains so much .
like how i have no human relat@@ ives .
and how i always think of you as a god .
ye@@ p . mon@@ keys are capable of many things .
too bad they aren 't better at sol@@ ving crim@@ es .
wait a minute .
i think i just figured it out .
i think i just sol@@ ved both cas@@ es .
if you 're right , then i 'll take back what i said about mon@@ keys not being good at sol@@ ving crim@@ es .
my partner needs to ask you some questions , chief .
if you don 't cooper@@ ate with us , ma '@@ am , we 're gon@@ na have to take you down to the station for question@@ ing .
don 't you get it , brig@@ gs ?
that 's not chief .
that 's not chief one bit .
that 's a bab@@ oon .
i won 10 large at the track , mon@@ key .
be back tomorrow before post time .
- crap .
- wait a minute .
what 's this money doing at your desk ?
okay , you got me .
i dress up this bab@@ oon to fill in for me when i go to the track .
it 's an old chief sur@@ geon 's trick .
i 've been doing it for 15 years .
your days of mon@@ ke@@ ying around are over .
yeah . it 's gon@@ na be a real hard day 's night for you .
let it be .
a bab@@ oon is so strong , they could tear a man 's head clean off his body .
which is exactly what he 's been doing ... for 15 years .
isn 't that right , fel@@ la ?
and there 's your confes@@ sion .
you 're in big trouble .
why ?
is re@@ plac@@ ing yourself at work with a mon@@ key a crime ?
in iraq , yes .
but not here , so ...
actually , i guess you 're not in trouble .
great .
thanks , guys .
how did you figure it out ?
sher@@ lock holmes once said ,
" when you elimin@@ ate the impossible , whatever re@@ mains , however im@@ probable , is most likely a mon@@ key . "
it takes a bab@@ oon to know a bab@@ oon .
sure does , partner . it sure does .
- owen , no .
it 's just a sir@@ en ! - a@@ ah ! - a@@ ah !
a@@ ah ! - really ?
! really ? !
- heel ! - a@@ ah ! a@@ ah !
- release ! release , buddy !
no , bad owen !

they were like vampire bat@@ s .
and for whatever reason , they were only bit@@ ing me .
you should see my back .
i 'm covered in bit@@ es .

when 's the last time you saved four lives in a single day ?
we 'll need to organize our sur@@ ger@@ ies so the wait time for each reci@@ pi@@ ent is as soon as possible .
they 'll need to be off of di@@ aly@@ sis and ready to go as soon as their organ@@ s arrive .
we 'll also need a team to confir@@ m that the reci@@ pi@@ ents are pre@@ pped and in the o.@@ r. by the time their kid@@ ne@@ ys arrive .
this is keith .
he 's our last reci@@ pi@@ ent .
but he 's in sever@@ e ren@@ al fail@@ ure and can 't travel to hope z@@ ion , so we will coordin@@ ate with st. donald 's to deli@@ ver his kid@@ ney .
this is all hands on deck .
i 'm gon@@ na bring in the junior resi@@ dents .
williams and mir@@ ani will keep things moving .
we 'll get se@@ kara to be our go@@ ph@@ er for the day .

seven sur@@ ger@@ ies .
four har@@ v@@ est and three tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ants in the next few hours before the final kid@@ ney goes to st. donald 's children 's hospital .
if something goes wrong with one ...

larry 's not big on cell@@ phones .
all he 's got is this old f@@ lip , and the batter@@ y 's always dead .
well , time is of the es@@ sence , emma .
he can 't just dis@@ appear like this .
he 'll be here , honey .
larry doesn 't have time for a lot of people , but his big sister 's one of them .
nobody can help an old guy with a chair , huh ?
- larry !
- larry .
must 've passed a dozen or@@ der@@ lies schle@@ pping this damn thing .
you 'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before li@@ z taylor here .
got your chair .
larry ...
they found a don@@ or .
what ?
i 'm getting my kid@@ ney .
the right don@@ or came in to trig@@ ger the dom@@ ino chain .
it is our lucky break .
well , i ...
i wasn 't expecting this today .
well , yes , i know .
this is all coming very fast .
but we need to move now .
we 'll get you into sur@@ ger@@ y short@@ ly .
but , uh ...
i was just reading this thing online .
a guy gave his kid@@ ney , and ... and , um ...
he develop@@ ed an un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able ap@@ petite for pum@@ p@@ kin pie .
wouldn 't eat anything else ...
just pum@@ p@@ kin pie , pum@@ p@@ kin pie , day after day .
i hate pum@@ p@@ kin pie .
are you seriously talking about pie right now ?
i ...
i just need time to process this , emma .
dr. re@@ id , maggie sent me down .

it 's fine .
just try to relax .
excuse me .
what 's going on ?
it 's the cad@@ aver@@ ic don@@ or .
we lost the right kid@@ ney .
how bad is it , maggie ?
right kid@@ ney 's lost blood sup@@ ply .
it 's a gon@@ er .
left one is hypo@@ plastic .
so , we are looking at a small kid@@ ney with a crazy arter@@ ial network .
might be too many to anast@@ om@@ ose .
well , terry 's pre@@ pped .
they haven 't opened him up yet .
what do you want to do ?
i promised four pati@@ ents they were getting off di@@ aly@@ sis today .
that is still the plan .
okay , we will cut a piece of her a@@ orta , use it to make an arter@@ ial cu@@ ff around the ren@@ al arter@@ ies , and then we 'll have one in anast@@ omo@@ sis instead of three .
okay .
go get ready for the next har@@ v@@ est , please .
m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
somebody page dr. bishop .
all right , ure@@ ter is free .
just the arter@@ y cu@@ ff to go .
so , the weather 's great in l.@@ a. why 'd you come back ?
i tried an emergen@@ cy spin@@ al cor@@ pec@@ tom@@ y on a 15-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old car crash vic@@ tim .
did they die ?
no .
no , i saved her life .
and i still got su@@ ed anyway .
wow .
that is rough .
yeah .
they had more law@@ yers on staff than doc@@ tors .
suc@@ tion .
i wasn 't getting any better ...
just saf@@ er .
from everything i 've heard about you , cau@@ tion isn 't really your thing .
the way you 're working those s@@ cis@@ sor@@ s , i 'd say it 's not yours , either .
okay .
here we go .
got it .
start per@@ fusion and get it ready for tran@@ sp@@ lant .
krist@@ ine .
oh , hey .
have you , um , seen a , uh ...
uh , yeah .
i 've seen her .
i 've been hearing her all day , too .
yeah .
i 've been trying to talk to her .
no , she doesn 't want to talk .
i don 't think she wants any help at all .
okay , well , what does she want ?
uh , well , what do you know about her ?
uh ...
she 's a trap@@ eze artist .
her and her partner took a bad fall .
he managed to pull through , but she 's having her ... har@@ vest@@ ed as we speak .
oh@@ h@@ h .
that 's so sad .
i-@@ i think i actually know the song .
" my pi@@ geon home , " it 's called .
it 's a lul@@ lab@@ y .
- lul@@ lab@@ y ?
- mm .
so she 's trying to put us to sleep .
not working .
well , it 's a song about reun@@ it@@ ing .
i think she might be trying to convince someone to join her .
when we met , i was the water boy for my high school basketball team , and i got stu@@ ffed in a lo@@ cker after practice .
did dan save you ?
no .
i was in the one next to him .
sounds rom@@ antic .
oh , it was .
took three hours till the jan@@ it@@ or found us .
what were you screaming , again ?
" my legs ...
i can 't feel my legs . "
sounds hil@@ ari@@ ous .
we knew if we could make it through high school together , we could make it through anything .
so far , we have .
time to go in .
take good care of him .
don 't tell me you don 't know the story of ab@@ el@@ ard and hel@@ oise .
no , but i have a funny feeling you 're about to tell me .
12@@ th century , paris .
hel@@ oise is this whi@@ p-@@ smart student who wants the answer to human existence .
well , that was her first mistake .
so she goes to study with pierre ab@@ el@@ ard , who 's the greatest schol@@ ar in france at the time ...
about 20 years her senior .
nothing wrong with that .
well , it was for her uncle ful@@ bert .
he found out about their affa@@ ir , beat the living crap out of ab@@ el@@ ard .
the lo@@ vers were ban@@ ished to live apart forever .
they correspon@@ ded by love letters for the rest of their lives .
so ?
what do you think ?
do you ever stop talking ?
um ...
when i 'm sleeping , i guess .
oh !
well , then , nigh@@ t-@@ night , professor .
oh , i 'm sorry .
you want one ?
not unless there 's we@@ ed in them .
no way .
which part of " i 'm a po@@ etr@@ y professor "
didn 't you understand ?
well , then , what the hel@@ oise are you waiting for ?
pass me a pot coo@@ kie .
m@@ mm !
m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
dr. re@@ id .
p@@ ali .
what 's up ?
i wanted to give this to her .
or to him ...
whoever 's don@@ ating to erin .
the don@@ ors are all anony@@ mous .
i can 't give you a name .
i-@@ i know , but the girls made me promise that i would give it to the person that helped their mom@@ my get better .
right .
i will see what i can do .
thank you .
you don 't know what it 's like sitting there hel@@ pl@@ ess while your best friend just gets s@@ ick@@ er and s@@ ick@@ er .
of course you know what it 's like .
you 're a doctor .
i ...
so you get why it 's so important to me that that gets to erin 's don@@ or ?
uh , yeah , just ...
i 'm sorry .
excuse me .
is everything okay ?
larry ?
oh !
where are you going ?
home .
what ?
why ?
i 'm not doing it .
i thought i was ready , but i 'm not .
i only came in today to drop off my sister 's chair .
okay , i know that all of this has been sprung on you , and you 're probably incredi@@ bly overwhel@@ med , but ...
all due respect , you have no idea what i 'm going through .
i made a decision .
i 'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone .
don 't let him leave the building .
- berger is still in the building .
- what ?
that was z@@ ach .
he spotted him pac@@ ing by the coffee ki@@ os@@ k .
which means he 's waf@@ fl@@ ing .
yes , which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his lat@@ te to get him back on board .
all right .
i got this .
hey , larry .
hi .
how do you know my name ?
my name 's dr. bishop .
it 's my first day here .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
i 'm leaving .
hey , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
just ...
just hear me out ...
just for a second .
i just moved back here from l.@@ a .
i was there training under this dr. pear@@ l@@ man .
amazing sur@@ geon .
gen@@ ius .
also ... a very pi@@ ous man .
and he taught me a lot of things .
including this hebre@@ w phrase ... " tik@@ kun ol@@ am . "
it 's from the tal@@ mud .
it means " re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing the world . "
says all of human@@ ity has a shared respon@@ sibil@@ ity to he@@ al and trans@@ form the world .
why are you telling me this ?
dr. pear@@ l@@ man , he 'd re@@ mind us about " tik@@ kun ol@@ am "
before every sur@@ ger@@ y we did .
larry , i think you have a chance to he@@ al the world today in the simpl@@ est , most pure kind of way .
and i know you 're scared .
i get that .
i really do .
i swear .
but i think it 's something worth considering .
and i don 't think you 'd still be here if you didn 't think so , too .
my mind 's made up .
the answer 's no .
i 'm sorry .
no .
so , there 's these , um ...
hm ?
um , you know ...
you know ...
double doors ... the kind that open in the center , and , um ...
but one of the h@@ ing@@ es was broken , so ... they ...
they kept that locked .
but he didn 't know that .
so , anyway , you know , he 's finally ready , and he 's got , you know , his tray of che@@ ese , you know , it 's just right .
and he 's carrying it like it 's , you know , the most preci@@ ous thing in the entire world .
and then bam !
his nose goes into the glass , tray goes everywhere .
there 's , like , honey all over his be@@ ard .
oh !
oh .
i 've come un@@ stuck .
oh !
who@@ op@@ sie .
hang on .
oh !
- what the ...
- here .
let me .
here .
should you be doing this ?
why not ?
because i 'm a ...
what 'd you say ?
a be@@ aker head with a god complex ?
no .
'@@ cause you 're higher than a lab mon@@ key .
what is going on here ?
um ...
relax .
josh just popped his i.@@ v .
i got it back in .
no , you can 't do that .
i 'm sorry , but this isn 't your charge , dr. kin@@ ney .
the hell it isn 't .
i 'm a sur@@ geon .
not in here , you 're not .
then what am i ?
i 'm sorry ?
if i 'm not a sur@@ geon , well , what am i ?
a dead du@@ ck .
that 's ...
that 's what he said .
i didn 't ...
that 's what you imp@@ lied .
in here , you 're just my patient .
right .
so , what are my chances of survi@@ ving this ?
dr. kin@@ ney .
no , seriously .
i have a re@@ occur@@ rence of stage 3 met@@ ast@@ atic breast cancer , so what are the od@@ ds i 'll be here ...
by christmas ?
that 's not fair .
you stay out of this .
as your patient , daw@@ son , i am asking .
i do ...
i ...
i 'm not ...
i don 't feel comfortable ans@@ wering that .
no .
of course you don 't .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm ...
i didn 't mean to be ...
you 're all good now , josh .
thank you .
okay , then .
um ...
i 'll be back in a bit to check on you both .
great .
where did you two meet ?
uh ...
at audit@@ ions for cir@@ que .
two total mis@@ f@@ its .
her parents , rus@@ sian im@@ migr@@ ants , kicked her out of the house when she was 14 .
mine ... hardly even noticed i was gone .
she understood me .
yeah , i guess when you meet someone like that ... who gets you , quir@@ ks and all ... nothing else really matters , right ?
dr. harris ?
time of death ... 3 : 13 p.@@ m .
kurt ?
let 's get him back to his room .
okay .
i don 't believe it .
it 's my fault .
i pushed him too hard .
it 's no one 's fault .
he 's never been very good with sur@@ prises .
when we were kids , i used to jump out behind cor@@ ners , and one time ...
she popped out , and i hit her square in the mouth .
15 stit@@ ches .
i told you he 'd come ' round .
you were right .
i am scared .
i 've been scared my whole life .
you 've always been this golden child ...
good gr@@ ades ...
good friends .
we 'll give you two some priv@@ acy .
i 've always been this neur@@ otic mess .
that 's not true .
it is .
everyone thought it was a joke when i said i would don@@ ate .
but you stood up for me .
we 're in a good place , emma .
i don 't want it to stop .
it won 't .
you 're my brother .
that is never gon@@ na change .
oh@@ h@@ h , boy .
uh , hey , alex , i need you to come take a look at this .
what do we have ?
a frozen kid@@ ney .
larry put us behind sched@@ ule .
it must have been too close to the ice for too long .
even if we th@@ aw that , we 've got little chance of getting it to perf@@ use .
we 've come too far to turn back now .
so , what do you want to do ?
get me 10 bags of warm sal@@ ine .
and a blo@@ w@@ tor@@ ch .
kid@@ ding !
hold the blo@@ w@@ tor@@ ch .
all right , then .
that fre@@ ez@@ ing didn 't do us any fav@@ ors , but the warm sal@@ ine flus@@ h ... it looked good .
you think it 'll live ?
it has to .
okay .
su@@ turing the ren@@ al v@@ ein .
okay .
ren@@ al v@@ ein and arter@@ y are anast@@ om@@ ose .
okay .
moment of truth .
let 's release those cl@@ amp@@ s and pr@@ ay that it takes .
exactly .
oh , come on .
come on .
let 's go .
okay .
we got good per@@ fusion .
yes !
yo@@ o@@ oo !
hey , do you mind doing the ure@@ ter anast@@ omo@@ sis ?
i have to go check in on larry , make sure he 's all right .
you got it .
thanks , bishop .
how did it go ?
this is odd .
what ?
he should be wak@@ ing up now .
heart rate 's sky@@ rock@@ eting .
alex ?
he could be having a stroke .
page sha@@ hir .
let 's get him up to imag@@ ing ... now .
okay .
good catch , alex .
it was a stroke .
he 's con@@ ing .
the sw@@ elling from the ep@@ id@@ ur@@ al ble@@ ed is pressing on his brain st@@ em .
there .
that should relie@@ ve the pressure .
alex , it 's okay .
you can go .
i 've done plenty of these .
turn up the music , please .
thank you .
my daughter , molly , is , um ...
stud@@ ying psych@@ ology at queens .
she wants to be a cou@@ ples coun@@ sel@@ or , of all things .
i haven 't told her yet ...
that it 's back .
tou@@ gh@@ est thing in the world ...
watching your kid trying to be brave ...
no matter how old they are .
especially when you know the real truth .
yeah , i 'd like to apologi@@ ze for that .
no .
why ?
it 's the truth .
okay .
then i say we - we double down on this ... " stranger on a train " vi@@ be we got going here .
let 's tell each other one thing that we 've never told another living soul .
okay .
yeah ?
who goes first ?
i don 't know .
you want to rock , paper , s@@ cis@@ sor@@ s ?
oh , careful .
you 're gon@@ na pull out your i.@@ v. again .
i 'll go .
i don 't want to do this again .
i don 't want to sit here , getting s@@ ick@@ er and s@@ ick@@ er .
i want to ...
i want to get on a plane .
i want to fly away .
your turn .
well , i want to come with you .
if looks could kill , i 'd be the ghost right now .
well , look at it this way .
what would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep alex away from you ?
so , how do we help her if she won 't talk to us ?
i don 't know .
you know , maybe he doesn 't see her , maybe he doesn 't hear her , but if he feels her , if he senses that she 's here ...
then what ?
he won 't move on , either ?
he won 't get better ?
that 's a bit of a stret@@ ch , don 't you think ?
charlie .
i 'm just saying , it 's not very scientif@@ ic .
no , look .
il@@ ly@@ ana , you need to talk to us .
he needs to be with me .
it was your time .
it 's not his .
you need to accept that .
he won 't make it without me .
he 's gon@@ na have to try .
i won 't go without him .
i can 't .
something 's wrong .
il@@ ly@@ ana , what are you doing ?
i love him too much .
his heart rate 's through the roof .
you need to go now !
i can 't .
i won 't .
he 's got a pet@@ ech@@ ial ras@@ h .
we need to get him to radi@@ ology right now .
could be a fat em@@ bol@@ us in his lungs .
bone mar@@ row may have se@@ ep@@ ed out of the break and mig@@ rat@@ ed .
- can you fix him ?
- i don 't know .
come on .
il@@ ly@@ ana !
stop !
call the code .
we need a crash car@@ t .
look , charlie .
code blue , e.@@ t. wing 203 .
code blue , e.@@ t. wing 203 .
kurt never had a chance .
i 'm really not in the mood to see the bright side .
people who love each other that much bel@@ ong together , even in death .
i 'm not bu@@ ying that .
sorry .
i had a daughter .
mad@@ die .
it was 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
not even happy hour .
this guy 's all over the road .
he 's coming right at us .
i tried to get out of the way , but there wasn 't enough time .
we didn 't ...
we didn 't have enough time .
my little girl .
kri@@ s .
i wanted to die ... so i could be with her .
i 'm sorry .
i had no idea .
when i woke up in the hospital ...
she was gone .
but there were all these other spir@@ its that only i could see .
there 's still so much i 'm trying to figure out about this ...
this thing we have .
well , maybe we could help each other , you know ?
figure this thing out together .
i 'd like that , charlie .
last ones .
i 'm glad to see you .
yeah , model pati@@ ents .
tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ants went off without a hit@@ ch .
p@@ ali , your kid@@ ney is taking a little trip to close out the dom@@ ino .
it 's going to somebody who desperately needs it .
thank you .
you 're welcome .

exhaust@@ ing , but , um ... event@@ ful .
alex .
i met a boy .
at chem@@ o ?
yes .
and he 's a po@@ et .
and he asked to come to paris with me because he wants to show me where ab@@ el@@ ard and hel@@ oise are buried .
dana .
and i said " yes . "
you just started chem@@ o .
i know , but i 'm ...
i 'm thinking that i just have to fight this in a different way for a while .
i 'm sorry , but this is insan@@ e .
actually , i think this is the san@@ est thing i have done in a long time .
you 're flying off to paris with a po@@ et that you met a few hours ago .
well , when you put it like that ...
instead of prolong@@ ing your life ...
alex .
i don 't want to prol@@ ong my life .
i want to live it .
hey .
how you feeling ?
like i just got run over .
you ?
same .
i wanted to , um ...
well ...
i , um ...
i wrote you something .
oh , it 's a ... - lim@@ er@@ ick , yeah . - yeah .
uh ...
it was the only rhy@@ me sch@@ eme i could remember , and i 'm half-@@ irish , so ...
" a terminal lass from kil@@ bride was be@@ fu@@ dd@@ led by fear and by pride . "
hm .
" till she heard a sweet man say he 'd come with her part@@ way .
so she kissed him , she smiled , and she cried . "
thank you , doctor .
so ...
how does it end ?
the story ?
oh .
- hel@@ oise .
- right .
does she find the real meaning of life ?
oh , she does .
oh , yeah ?
the love she found with ab@@ el@@ ard ...
that was the meaning of human existence .
oh .
love .
hey . what 's going on ?
nothing .
you ready ?
look , i get it , greg is your jacob , but we all know you 're going to end up with edward .
because you 're bella .
what is that reference ?
it 's on the tip of my tongue .
it 's ...
t@@ wil@@ ight .
t@@ wil@@ ight , yes .
it 's only the greatest love story
- since shakespeare ... in love . - right .
yeah .
right , yeah , okay .
what are you talking about again ?
you spent than@@ ks@@ giving with greg , and that was not part of our plan .
you need to be with josh .
if not for you , then for me .
- why ?
- i need this .
my marriage is like the walking dead , okay ?
we are all just trying to get out alive .
you and josh , your love story ... it gives me hope .

listen , dar@@ ry@@ l , i know i didn 't bring my " a " game ...
i think you need to go home .
wait , are you taking me off the case ?
please don 't take me off the case , because if you take me off the case , that means i 'm not working and if i 'm not working , that means i have to think thoughts .
okay , you 're not off the case .
but go home and work on the present@@ ation .
and then , when you come back on mon@@ day , i want you to be the happy rebecca that we all know and love .
such a good tip .

hey , are you sure you 're cool to do the calvin dinner without me ?
well , i 'll do my best .
okay . uh , i got@@ ta hop off .
i 'm really working hard here .

there is nothing sexy about depression , rebecca .
listen , you better get your act together , young lady , or you 're gon@@ na run this new life off in the dit@@ ch .
how did you get in here ?
well , your de@@ pressed mind invit@@ ed me in .
and by the way , this place is a dum@@ p .
you ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something , anything ?
maybe a mur@@ al ?
i don 't know about this .
are you sure this is the din@@ ing table she wants ?
i don 't know .
- i want to surprise her .
- surprise her ?
with fur@@ nit@@ ure ?
she 's very pic@@ ky , du@@ de .
yeah , yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage .
you bought the kind you put in food , not the kind you scar@@ e ghost@@ s away with .
valencia 's intense , bro .
as sexy as she is , she 's intense .
she has final appro@@ val over all your clothing .
yeah , you know ... yes .
i really miss your cargo 's .
we all do .
guys , i 'm commit@@ ted to this relationship .
i want to contribu@@ te .
you know ? she 's done everything .
she picked out the apartment , she book@@ ed the moving tr@@ ucks .
we 're supposed to be a team and i want to do something for her .
so we gon@@ na do this or what ?
yes . yes , we are going to do this .
guys , we can bang this out .
according to this , it is a very simple - 7@@ 2-@@ step process . - 7@@ 2-@@ step process .
oh , hell no .
okay . we 're not doing that .
we lost hector .
what are you looking for ?
oh , my god , you 're still here .
tell it to me straight .
am i sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ?
i 'm not really here .
i 'm just in your imagination .
i mean , let 's face it :
you do have a very active imagination .
one minute , you 're walking down the street , the next minute , you 're in a big musical .
although , i got@@ ta say ,
i did love the pret@@ zel .
you did a good job on that one .
aw , it 's a sho@@ el@@ ace tip .
ugh , that 's gro@@ ss .
oh , my god , you 're looking for pres@@ cription me@@ ds in a dra@@ wer ?
so ?
listen , when i moved here , i thought i was okay , so i dum@@ ped them all my me@@ ds and now , you know , i realize that i 'm not okay .
i mean , look at me , i 'm falling apart here .
this is really bad .
so if i can just get my old pres@@ cription me@@ ds back , i 'll be okay .
uh , here 's a thought .
anxi@@ ety , depression ... how about you see a doctor first ?
i 'll go do that .
ten steps ahead of you .
thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice ,
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian .
what can i help you with ?
i 'm not myself right now .
we 're always our@@ selves , rebecca .
right . yeah .
no , so i don 't feel like myself .
this isn 't usually how i am .
like , i 'm normally very organiz@@ ed and focused .
sounds like you 're feeling out of control .
let 's del@@ ve into your chil@@ d@@ hood .
oh , i was afraid you 'd say that .
okay , so , i 've been through the therap@@ y wr@@ inger ,
i 've re@@ has@@ hed my chil@@ d@@ hood a ton .
and i don 't really want to do it again .
like , for me and for you , frank@@ ly , i don 't want to put that on you .
so here 's what i need .
i need these .
those are the me@@ ds i was on in new york .
oh , my god .
how did your body re@@ act to all this medi@@ cation ?
you must not have been able to feel a thing .
exactly .
num@@ b as they come .
so ... scri@@ b@@ ble scri@@ b@@ ble on your piz@@ z@@ le pad .
rebecca , your doctor in new york is a qu@@ ack .
he gave you a band@@ -@@ aid , not a cure .
my meth@@ od would be to do some dig@@ ging and figure out what 's really going on inside your mind .
and then we can discus@@ s the appropri@@ ate medi@@ c@@ ations .
so that 's great , but i need to be better by mon@@ day .
it 's a work thing , so ... we doing this ?
no , we 're not .
okay , well , you know what ?
you 'll be hearing from me on yel@@ p .

josh could find you if he wanted to .
you have made yourself really easy to find .
you have been rej@@ ec@@ ted .

you 're gon@@ na be so excited !

so , may i ask who 's crazy now ?
i never said you were crazy .
that 's a der@@ og@@ atory term and i don 't think it really app@@ lies to you .
where were you in my senior gen@@ der studies class ?
we 'll talk about that later .
for now , it 's time to get down to business .
but you know , before i get down to business , i 'm just gon@@ na see what my friends are up to .
inst@@ ag@@ ram , oh !
valencia post@@ ed a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom .
it says ♪ christ@@ ened ...
how nice .
oh , nice to hear .
how 's that working for you ?
i don 't understand your question .
but you know what , i 'm starting to realize that maybe that p@@ ill was not what i needed .
oh , there 's a sho@@ cker .
just spar@@ e me .
spar@@ e me the wis@@ ecr@@ acks .
hey , it 's me .
you got any down@@ ers ?
is this enough of a dow@@ ner for you ?
oh , my god .
i could just mel@@ t into the chair , like , like a but@@ ter lady .
that 's good .
no , that 's bad .
because i can 't get work done right now .
oh , i have an idea .
it 's the most fantast@@ ic-@@ i@@ est idea .
that 's not a real word .
seriously , seriously , seriously .
seriously , are you busy right now ?
honey , hi .
yeah , i-@@ i 'll be home in , like , an hour , to@@ ps .
thanks , boo@@ bo@@ o .
valencia 's so mad at me .
we 've been here all night , and i haven 't even finished sor@@ ting the scre@@ ws .
josh , there 's still time to ba@@ il .
on the table , i mean .
we were friends with you before we even met this table .
uh , the truth is none of us really even
like the current table .
i hate this table .
we don 't like , um , this table .
and you 're going to ru@@ in your life if you stick with this table .
bros before ... tables .
i think it 's a nice thing you 're doing .
nic@@ est thing i ever did for a girl was pull out .
hector ?
she has tan@@ dem parking , so after i 'm there for a while , i have to pull out .
which is such a pain , ' cause it feels so great just to leave it in there .
the worst is when it 's alter@@ nate side of the street parking , ' cause then i got to park it in back .
i don 't even get why there 's a spot back there .
it 's so tight .
feels more like an exit .
so then i 'm going front , back , front , back ... and it 's all dirty in the back , so when i move it to the front , then that gets all dirty .
i 'm just happy i have a spot at all .
'@@ cause i used to have to pay .
well , that was edi@@ f@@ ying .
this bur@@ r@@ ito is a symph@@ ony .
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian 's gon@@ na be so happy to see me .
when i pop up , she 's gon@@ na be like ,
" w@@ hoa , you 're so chill !
i 'm gon@@ na give you all the drug@@ s " "
well , i want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around . h@@ mm .
i bet her vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ aner is filled with cool pharmac@@ eut@@ ic@@ als .
that 's such a good point !
i know .
i wonder what she has in there .
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian ?
dr. ak@@ op@@ ian , it 's me rebecca bunch !
i 'm really cool and chill now .
okay , not giving up , not giving up !
here , dr. ak@@ op@@ ian ?
oh , my god , it 's her pres@@ cription pad .
oh , i see it !
wait , she wouldn 't have left it by the window if she didn 't , like , want somebody to take it , right ?
yeah , it 's like a wiz@@ ard test .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait , wait , what are you doing ?
you can 't fit through there .
yeah , yeah , i totally can .
because look at me ... look how tiny i am .
i 'm tiny ...
i 'm chil@@ d-@@ size .
i 'm a pu@@ ppy .
i 'm a po@@ od@@ le . i 'm a shr@@ im@@ p .

i 'm a student .

breaking and enter@@ ing .
first of all ,
i only half-@@ entered .
and second of all , as far as the breaking goes , you have no idea of my in@@ tent to ste@@ al your pres@@ cription pad .
i do now .
but since you were both st@@ oned when you broke in , and not in your right mind ...
i 'm willing to offer you a deal , ms. bunch .
make an ap@@ pointment and start to get help and i won 't press charges against either of you .
fine . yeah . you win .
let 's do this .
i will come in here ,
i will expl@@ ore my feelings , do whatever you want .
now can i have the drug@@ s ?
we 're done here .
i 'm done .
i give up .
i 'm gon@@ na take a nap here for just a ... year .
what about your job th@@ ing@@ y ?
oh , god , i hope dar@@ ry@@ l doesn 't fire me .
do me a favor ?
can you get my phone ?
i think it 's in your purse .
i know , i 'm just too tired .
can you get it ?
just put it in my hand ?
just place it inside my hand .
it 's coming .
place it inside .
- there .
- thank you .
hi , paula .
it 's me .
yeah , okay , listen , i got something to tell you .
i 'm not proud of it .
i can@@ not do the present@@ ation with calvin on mon@@ day .
can you tell dar@@ ry@@ l for me ?
i '@@ m-@@ i 'm actually with calvin , so i could just tell him .
what ?
we are at the hotel on east cameron and he just went out for ice , and i only have a second .
hotel ?
why are you at a ho ...
is that anita baker playing in the background ?
oh , oh , he 's coming back .
i got@@ ta go .
i need a cab .
uber .
i need an uber .
oh , okay .
actually , no , forget the uber , it 's just around the corner .
come on !
i 've never been in a hotel room with a couch before .
uh , all the per@@ ks .
i can 't believe i 'm doing this .
it 's like a fantasy ... like stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries and champagne is just gon@@ na mag@@ ically arrive at the door .
you didn 't !
don 't do it !
look at that .
it 's beautiful !
she 's gon@@ na love it .
i-@@ i feel so great about this .
she 's here . she 's here , guys .
m@@ wa@@ h . okay . okay .
what ?
left .
what is it ?
is it a pu@@ ppy ?
babe , what am i looking at ?
surprise !
it 's your new din@@ ing room table .
we stayed up all night making it for you .
- that you didn 't pick out .
- and i helped .
that 's so sweet .
so , do you like it ?
well ... it doesn 't match our other things .
it 's not exactly what i would 've picked out .
oh , well , i mean , if it 's ... not something you want , i mean , i guess i ...
you could take it apart and give it back ?
josh , you are so smart .
that 's a great idea .
give me a kiss .
i got to go back to class , you guys , but thank you so much .
oh , and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table .
yeah ? okay . bye .
she scar@@ es me so bad .
look , paula ,
i know your marriage is crap .
i get it .
and i get that you 're about to have the ho@@ tt@@ est sex of your life .
m@@ mm .
right . so why are you stopping me ?
because it 's not real .
it 's a band@@ -@@ aid .
you know that .
remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality , right ?
and i didn 't get it ?
now i get it .
you 're doing the exact same thing .
you need to face your real problem , and your real problem is that your marriage is dead .
and you need to fully feel that , and you need to face it , because this is just a tempor@@ ary fix .
it 's like a p@@ ill you found on the bathroom floor .
who would take a p@@ ill they found on the floor ?
look , look , i 've spent my whole life num@@ bing myself , okay ?
i have spent my whole life escap@@ ing to far@@ -@@ off places , and it 's only rec@@ ently , like , now , like , liter@@ ally this second that i realize , like , i can 't do that !
i can 't do that .
i have to feel my feelings .
it 's okay to feel , paula .
it 's been five years since i made love without the tv on .
and ten years since somebody held my hand .
i-@@ i miss my dead wife .
come here .
liter@@ ally the most entertain@@ ing day of my life .
rebecca , making a spe@@ ech like that in front of a potential client , that ... was brave .
also a bit fool@@ ish .
in most cas@@ es , clients would run in the opposite direction .
and i understand if this means you don 't want to work with me ...
look , let me finish .
you have the kind of no-@@ non@@ sense honest@@ y and raw emo@@ tional in@@ sight that i look for in a commercial real estate law@@ yer .
you are a wonderful woman ,
this weekend has been so special .
but marriage is a preci@@ ous thing .
if i could hold my wife for one more second ...
oh . don 't make me cry again .
is this al@@ pac@@ a ?
it 's so soft .
my dead white wife loved al@@ pac@@ a .
what did you say to calvin ?
he was so im@@ pressed , he 's not even seeing other people .
i mean , how did you swing that ?
i just was honest about ... about all the great work you do ,
i just made him see what you wanted him to see , that we 're a group of kick@@ -@@ ass law@@ yers and we 're a family .
feel your feelings .
everyone should feel their feelings .
everyone should always feel their feelings .
well , i , for one , am feeling pe@@ eved , because this copi@@ er ...
cor@@ k it , karen !
but this copi@@ er ...
cor@@ k it !
rebecca , i 'm very glad you 're wel@@ coming the opportunity to work on yourself .
i am so grateful to be here , and i 'm excited to face my problems head@@ -@@ on .
i know it 's gon@@ na be hard work , but it 's work that i am prepared ... it 's work ...
i 'm sorry .
i know i should just ... work ,
i should make sure this isn 't an emergen@@ cy .
one second .
_
you know what , i 'm feeling better already , actually .
so i '@@ m-@@ i 'm gon@@ na go to this very important thing , but i want to let you know that this is not over .
i 'll see you next week .
what ?
get out of here !

that 's perfect !
because valencia is mexic@@ an and i 'm filipino and rice is a stap@@ le in both of our ...
cultures . yeah . right .
uh , oh , sorry it took me forever to return your call from friday .
oh , my gos@@ h , you ... you 're so busy .
don 't even think about it .
hey , can i ask you something ?
anything .
is this a nice table ?
it 's a perfect table .
that 's what i think .
thanks .
no problem .
uh , hey , um , do you want to come over some@@ time , just check out the new place ?
there 's not a lot of fur@@ nit@@ ure , so there 's plenty of room to slip and slide around in our so@@ cks like in ris@@ ky business .
oh , my god , that sounds amazing .
yes .
when ?
now ?
just , like , don 't tell valencia , ' cause she thinks it 's stupid .
well , valencia 's stupid .
sorry . i 'm sure she 's smart in her own way .
but anyway i have the perfect sli@@ pp@@ y-@@ sli@@ de@@ y so@@ cks .
number 31 .
oh , no . don 't you start with me .
just keep walking , old man .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
get out of my life .
oh , my god , uh , dr. phil .
i 'm a huge fan .
- how you doing ? - oh .
i 'm s ... oh , my gos@@ h . i 'm sorry .
you 're actually dr. phil .
in the flesh .
it 's me .
even dr. phil has got to have his bo@@ ba .
i 'm ad@@ dic@@ ted to these things .
maybe you should , uh , get help for that .
you guys make a really cute couple .
oh . that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
no , no , no .
we 're just friends .
that 's so funny . he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny .
we 're not a couple .
he thinks we 're a couple .
that 's so funny , but we 're not a couple .

dr. schol@@ ls , can you show the detec@@ tives what you showed me ?
trying to make me je@@ alous ?
- is that a whist@@ le ?
- in his wind@@ p@@ ipe .
and something tells me he wasn 't born with it .
although he did die with it .
we think someone shoved a whist@@ le down his throat after a strugg@@ le .
you can see the defen@@ sive wo@@ unds here and here .
why a whist@@ le ?
someone trying to send a message ?
don 't blow whist@@ les ?
someone 's telling him not to be a whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer .
but what was he blo@@ wing the whist@@ le on ?
no idea .
we examin@@ ed every other or@@ if@@ ice several times but found no evidence .
we 'll try and take out the whist@@ le and see if we can pull some dna .
mean@@ while , we 'll go pay a visit to the coast guard .
the commandant 's a very busy man , you know .
we appreciate you getting us in , pet@@ ty officer sn@@ ick .
chief pet@@ ty officer sn@@ ick , thank you very much .
and i thought you said you were coming at 2 : 00 .
isn 't it 2 : 00 ?
it 's 1 : 50 , which means i only got a 20-@@ minute lunch break , but whatever .
it 's fine . i 'll have a candy bar or something .
sorry , pet@@ ty officer .
we didn 't think it was a big deal .
detec@@ tives , commandant don van z@@ and@@ t .
come in , detec@@ tives .
that 'll be all , sn@@ ick .
you 're welcome .
first of all , i 'd like to thank you for finding se@@ aman bu@@ cket .
we are a bro@@ ther@@ hood , and when one of our brothers go missing , it hur@@ ts the whole coast guard family .
if there 's anything that i could do to ass@@ ist in your investig@@ ation , don 't be afraid to ask .
well , for star@@ ters ...
i 'm afraid that 's all the time that i 've got today .
c@@ po sn@@ ick will see you out .
we were really hoping to ask you some questions ,
commandant don van z@@ and@@ t .
i know you were , detective . i know you were .
you listen here , po@@ pe@@ ye .
this is a murder investig@@ ation , and we 're the murder police .
so start talking .
i think you 're outside of your juris@@ diction , detective .
this is an intern@@ al matter for the coast guard , thus to be hand@@ led intern@@ ally by the coast guard with no outside help .
all due respect , commandant , this base is in l.@@ a. county , so when somebody 's killed in l.@@ a. , it is very much in our juris@@ diction .
now , we 'd like to interview his bun@@ k mates . we want to talk to the last person who saw him alive , and we want to know why he ended up dead in a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
i don 't know how he disappeared or why he ended up in that re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator or how he got that whist@@ le down his throat , but if our investig@@ ation turns up anything of interest , i 'll be sure to call you .
c@@ po sn@@ ick will see you out .
we 'll see our@@ selves out .
okay . it 's my one job , but go ahead .
we need base access , we need to interview his ship@@ mates , but the coast guard ke@@ eps shut@@ ting us down at every turn .
because they know something that they don 't want to tell us .
it 's a classic case of keeping something secret .
if they want to get into a jurisdic@@ tional dick@@ -@@ me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing con@@ test , i 'm all for it .
it sounds like fun , and i like my chances .
go talk to the mel@@ anie bur@@ ke at the d.@@ a. ' s office and see if she can help us out .
got it .
- lieutenant . - ye@@ p ?
as predic@@ ted , the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator guy came as soon as i got in the shower .
damn it !
that 's so frustr@@ ating .
it 's like they know .
so i can either wait till tomorrow at the same time , or i can go to the ware@@ house in long beach and talk to them .
that 's a hell of a long drive , but i don 't think it can wait .
i 'll be all right .
there 's a dave bu@@ ster 's right next door .
tan@@ ner !
i 'm gon@@ na go with you .
this guy 's going to the chair .
as god as my wit@@ ness , he 's gon@@ na fr@@ y .
just back@@ ing up a bit , we don 't know who did it .
yeah , but we appreciate your enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
someone showed up to work today .
all right , what do you guys want , huh ?
just tell me what you want , and i 'm gon@@ na put it in your little hands .
all right ? you want a court order ?
you want a sub@@ po@@ ena ?
you want a grand jury ?
i 'm gon@@ na get you a grand jury .
we 're not quite there yet , mel@@ anie , but good to know we have you in our back pocket .
all right , so hit me . anything .
give it to me .
well , i guess we could start by getting sub@@ po@@ enas
- for some of bu@@ cket 's ship@@ mates .
- already done .
how about a search war@@ rant ?
check your in@@ box . already there . did it this morning .
- can i use your rest@@ room ?
- you just did .
- val@@ id@@ ate parking ?
- i would love to .
parking .
got here at 10 : 21 .
it 's 11 : 04 now , so that 's ... that 's ... that 's 28 ... 28 minutes .
no , that 's like 40 minutes .
sh@@ h . okay . these are 15-@@ minute increm@@ ents .
- there we go .
- we 'll just pay .
- i got this .
- please , just give us our tic@@ ket back .
can you just ...
'@@ cause i had it , and now i don 't have it .
- just give it back .
- this one is ...
you can stick it together .
ah@@ h ... oh . they 're not lic@@ kies .
it 's fine .
this is great . thank you .
come on , guys ! hurry up !
i told you . i don 't know anything about no body in no fri@@ dge .
so , no one looks into the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators when you take them off the boat ?
of course . every produc@@ t gets qualit@@ y-@@ control@@ led .
nobody thought to raise a red flag when they saw a body in a fri@@ dge ?
when my guys checked it , there was no body , okay ?
my guys know what they 're doing .
lieutenant , i 'm gon@@ na need you to look away for this one .
mr. ster@@ elli , let me ask you something .
how do you feel about dave bu@@ ster 's ?
it 's the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one destination for family fun .
- everybody knows that . - mm .
how about if i told you i had 5,000 tic@@ kets with your name all on them ?
i 'm listening .
have you had any inter@@ action with the coast guard ?
they come around sometimes , make sure the ship@@ ments get through with no has@@ s@@ les .
what ship@@ ments ?
they don 't tell me nothing , and i don 't ask nothing .
every once in a while , a ship@@ ment of app@@ li@@ ances comes off through the boat that i 'm not allowed to insp@@ ect .
they put it in a coast guard truck and take it off my hands .
that 's all i know .
anything else , you 're gon@@ na have to ask the coast guard .
thank you , mr. ster@@ elli .
thank you very much .
excuse me !
excuse me , se@@ amen and women !
we 're wondering if any@@ body has any information on the death of charlie bu@@ cket .
i got information .
but if you want me to talk , you got to beat me .
not you .
the other lady .
se@@ aman bu@@ cket was my bun@@ k mate .
we were closer than brothers .
i know this is difficult , but can you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt him ?
no .
no idea .
he was a great sail@@ or and really popular , although , the last couple weeks , it did seem like he really had something on his mind .
i 'd say to him , " hey , charlie . you got something on your mind ? "
and he would say , " huh ? what ? "
like he had something on his mind .
you have any idea what happened to his stuff ... clothes , foot@@ lo@@ cker , deta@@ iled di@@ ary ?
yeah , i did find one deta@@ iled di@@ ary .
i didn 't think anything of it at the time .
you want to take a look at it ?
it might help .
yo .
" smas@@ h mouth " is two words .
a coast guard truck ? this late ?
we should go check it out .
we don 't have a war@@ rant .
oh , i think we 'll be okay .
what the hell was that ?
i can 't win@@ k .
tan@@ ner , hit the sir@@ en .
evening , detec@@ tives .
- is it ?
- how can i help you ?
how 's about you open the back of that truck and let us have a look@@ -@@ see ?
i 'm afraid i can 't do that , detective .
i 'm on official coast guard business , so unless you want to take it up with the president of the united states ...
i 'll do that .
president obama , lieutenant pr@@ it@@ ik@@ in at@@ kins .
is it okay if we look inside a coast guard truck ?
thank you .
good night , sir .
- wait , can i talk to him ?
- oh . he hung up .
is he bu@@ ying it ?
it 's hard to read his face .
what 's he doing now ?
he 's still looking with a susp@@ icious look on his face .
what are you two whisper@@ ing about ?
vit@@ am@@ ins .
ke $ ha .
vice president .@@ 45 says open the back of the truck .
hey , how 's it going , eh ?
are we in america ?
canadi@@ ans ?
what in the name of tim hor@@ tons is going on here ?
mr. president , we have a situation .
i didn 't know the coast guard de@@ als in the traff@@ icking of il@@ legal im@@ migr@@ ants .
there 's a lot you don 't know , detective , like how to ap@@ ply ey@@ el@@ iner or who won best picture in 1984 .
" am@@ ade@@ us . "
what were you doing with a tr@@ uck@@ load of canadi@@ ans ?
answer me !
okay , you want to play that game ?
well , we just found your dna on the whist@@ le inside of se@@ aman bu@@ cket 's throat , so you 're going down either way .
if you cooper@@ ate , maybe we can get the charges reduc@@ ed .
i don 't have to answer to you . i only answer to one man .
but there is one tiny bit of information you should know .
i have a horrible sh@@ ell@@ fish aller@@ gy .
- w@@ hoa , put down the shr@@ im@@ p !
- don 't do it , man . no .
put it down .
no . that 's no way to go out .
- nice knowing you , detec@@ tives .
- not like this !
- put the shr@@ im@@ p do ...
- oh , and an@@ gie ,
- ser@@ geant pe@@ pper says hello .
- don 't do it , man !
- dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s for mayor ! - no ! no !
this is great .
case closed .
we got our mur@@ derer , and we didn 't have to watch a jury scre@@ w it up .
who wants to see a fl@@ ick ?
this isn 't over .
we have to go after van z@@ and@@ t .
there 's a massive conspir@@ acy going on here .
officer sn@@ ick put a shr@@ im@@ p in his mouth just to protect it .
i don 't want to do 3-@@ d . it makes me diz@@ zy .
we can@@ not trust the coast guard to investig@@ ate itself .
i 'm not gon@@ na stand here and watch this get lost in the shu@@ ff@@ le .
tri@@ be@@ ca , the buck has offici@@ ally been passed .
it 's im@@ migration and ja@@ g cor@@ p 's problem now .
we all want to put the bad guys away and see the good guys get it all wrapped up nic@@ ely , which is why i 'm thinking we see " jack re@@ acher " at 8 : 15 .
i saw it .
brown stuff . rocks .
when did it become so hard for the good guys to do any good ?
sometimes i think we 'd make more of a difference without the bad@@ ge .
you 've just been so different lat@@ ely .
i 'm still incredi@@ bly at@@ trac@@ ted to you .
but something 's changed .
i 'm in a bad place , ge@@ ils .
you don 't want any part of this .
we 're doing good , an@@ gie .
we 're making a difference .
at the end of the day , you just got to leave the job at the job .
you 're right .
guess i 'm just having a bad year .
i 'm gon@@ na call it a night .
an@@ gie , promise me you won 't do anything crazy .
i promise .
set a course for dream@@ land .
relax .
i 'm not here to ar@@ rest you .
or sleep with you .
take me to pe@@ pper .
never .
ah@@ h , ah@@ h , a@@ ah ! your feet are fre@@ ez@@ ing !
okay , i 'll take you !
so , what are the canadi@@ ans for ?
are you putting together some kind of army ?
not soldiers .
vo@@ ters .
it 's right up here on the right .
- face forward .
- thanks , commandant .
i 'm done with you .
here 's your chap@@ stick back .
drive .
not until you tell me what the hell you 're up to .
you know what i see when i look out this window ?
no .
no more bull@@ shit .
you 're impor@@ ting canadi@@ ans to vote for dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s ? what is this ?
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
he 's gon@@ na win . he 's killing dre@@ y@@ fus@@ s in the pol@@ ls .
mayor perry will not be the next mayor of los angeles .
one way or another , he 's gon@@ na lose , and there isn 't a damn thing you can do abo ...
i 'm in .
oh . really ?
i thought that was gon@@ na be a lot harder .
great . good news .
where do we start ?
just act normal , and at a certain point , the commandant will contact you .
i 'm really happy you 're join@@ ing us , an@@ gie .
previ@@ ously on crazy ex-@@ girlfriend ...
whatever happened with you and your ex ?
ex ?
oh , greg , i 'm sorry .
- do you love her ?
- no .
you forgive me ?
of course , i forgive you , jo@@ sh@@ y .
love doesn 't work out for me , ever .
so you are un@@ happy .
yeah . du@@ h .
maybe it 's time you see what else is in your life , besides josh chan .
oh , my gos@@ h , you have changed my life ,
dr. dream ghost ak@@ op@@ ian .
you made me see past all of my del@@ us@@ ions that were holding me back .
josh , you don 't understand ?
you don 't see what this has all been about for rebecca ?
rebecca , are you in love with me ?

i had ... have ... had feelings for you , indeed , yes .
god , this is awkward , um , i came here to tell you that valencia ...
valencia and you are staying together .
- no ... i-@@ i-@@ i i gathered . - yeah .
i get it and that makes sense , yeah .
josh , i 'm actually very glad you 're here , because , um , i realized some things on my recent trip .
and , um , one of the things i realized is that i need to break my old patter@@ ns .
okay .
yes , uh , starting with ...
i 've been horrible to valencia , like , really horrible , and i really want to reach out to her .
- i really wouldn 't .
- i really think i should .
she really hat@@ es your gut@@ s .
under@@ stand@@ able , and i will just have to trans@@ cen@@ d that .
i am trying to break free of anything un@@ heal@@ thy or dam@@ ag@@ ing .
so , um , that starts with , uh , tras@@ hing these .
unless you want them .
no , no , that 's okay .
although , um , you know , some of those are great ang@@ les that you can 't get with a sel@@ fie , so , uh ...
- sure , yeah , yes . - yeah .
thanks .
okay , well , there it is .
that 's the last of the josh chan stuff .
there was stuff ?
no .
well , i guess i should go .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . of course , get out .
- get out of here . - yeah , yeah .
bye , josh .
can i get another beer ?
i 'm trying to study .
stud@@ ying and drinking at the same time : good decision .
i know , right ?
it 's easy .
it 's extension school .
i-@@ i don 't like to tell a lot of people this , but i got into em@@ ory business school .
it 's a pretty good school .
they call it like the harvard of the south .
i thought the harvard of the south was v@@ ander@@ bil@@ t .
no . no . no .
yeah , so i got into school , and then my dad got sick , so now i 'm working my way through school here .
you know ?
i can 't be s@@ ling@@ ing drin@@ ks to lo@@ ser@@ s until i 'm like 60 years old .
oh , boy , look at this .
just what i need .
- hi . - hey .
i thought you dr@@ ank at home base .
i drink anywhere , but i do my stud@@ y-@@ drinking here .
got it .
can i pull up a sto@@ ol next to you , or do you want to ... be alone ?
i could go home and drink some mou@@ th@@ wash .
mou@@ th@@ wash , wow .
that 's almost as sad as a girl coming to a strange bar by herself .
sad says the man with an open text@@ book ... next to an open contain@@ er .
this is fun .
i like this .
do you want to hang out for a while and insul@@ t each other ?
ah , what would your girlfriend think about that ?
um , heather ?
uh , yeah , no , we 're don@@ e-@@ zo .
oh , wow . i had no idea .
can i get you a drink ?
nothing goes better with a fine lager than a little snar@@ k .
wait .
go back to the heather thing .
are you okay ?
let '@@ s-@@ let@@ -@@ let 's talk .
talk is not on the bar menu , but we could ask .
okay , so , yeah , here 's the thing .
old me would have been totally down for , like , an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned bar@@ b fest , but i 've decided rec@@ ently that i 'm trying to change my patter@@ ns .
so i 'm gon@@ na go .
no , come on . come on .
i 'm a glu@@ t@@ ton for pun@@ ishment .
stay . let 's do this .
we can make bad decisions together .
we could run in traffic .
no ?
okay .
boy , she really dig@@ s you .
she 's in love with someone else , but i figure ten , 11 years of me trying ,
i 'm a lock .
okay , what is happening ?
why are you throwing out all this josh stuff ?
i told you , i 've gone cold tur@@ key on the chan .
i 'm done .
it 's not good for me , and you know that .
d ... oh , g ... you have to keep the macar@@ oni portrait .
that took two weeks .
no , no , paula , i 'm breaking my old patter@@ ns .
break old pat ... i ...
what does that even mean ?
did you go to a bum@@ per st@@ ick@@ er store ?
no , i just realized a lot of things on my trip to new york , while i was in a bum@@ per st@@ ick@@ er store .
okay , but you 're right about this , actually , it has a lot of dry go@@ ods on it , it actually could be use@@ ful for my ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake kit ,
- so i will keep this .
- that 's my girl .
but everything else goes in the tras@@ h .
- h@@ mm , h@@ mm . - oh , come on .
not chann@@ y bear .
i for@@ bid it .
fine , maybe i 'll just put chann@@ y bear on a high shel@@ f in case of a ... be@@ ar-@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy .
but the rest of this is going , bye .
- oh , come on ... - bye , letters to josh .
first dr@@ af@@ ts , second dr@@ af@@ ts .
- in the tras@@ h .
- no .
- ye@@ p .
- that 's ...
- that 's insan@@ ity . - no@@ pe .
no@@ pe .
good@@ -@@ bye , josh thong that i never wo ... i don 't wear th@@ ong@@ s .
why did i even get this ?
you have finally lost it .
you have left the reserv@@ ation and i-@@ i can 't ... i 'm not ...
i can 't watch it . i don 't care . i don 't care .
i 'm not suppor@@ ting this .
no , u@@ h-@@ uh .
hey ... i 'm so nervous , aren 't you ?
that last test ...
was pretty easy , at least for me .
wow , that 's impres@@ sive .
you must be smart .
yeah , well .
i-@@ i don 't like to tell people this , but , um ...
oh , you don 't have to tell me something you don 't like to ...
i got into the harvard of the south .
em@@ ory ?
you know it ?
em@@ ory ?
the harvard of the south is duke .
no .
no , no .
em@@ ory . google it .
so , everyone , over@@ all there were some nice efforts , but , uh , some of you , i 'm sad to say , fell short .
i 'm really not sure what rub@@ ric you 're using to grade these , but ...
doesn 't take much of a rub@@ ric to see that you didn 't put in much of an effort here .
oh , well , you know , i work ful@@ l-@@ time .
my dad is sick .
i work two jobs and my husband is dead .
i am very sorry to hear that , but i ... was not involved .
your next as@@ sign@@ ment is an es@@ say due friday .
you can do better , mr. serr@@ ano .
you got into the harvard of the south , after all , which you somehow managed to mention on your test .
a multiple choice test .
so , you 're bust@@ ing my balls about an in@@ tro class at an extension school ?
cool , yeah . makes sense .
look , i don 't know you very well , but from where i stand , it seems like you 've made the choice not to try or something .
oh , please , don 't you worry about my decisions .
i will decide about my decisions .
cho@@ os@@ ing not to try , greg .
you got into em@@ ory , greg .
i mean , du@@ h , i could have done better .
i could have gotten an " a " on that test if i 'd wanted to .

okay , you can 't give up on josh right now .
you are so close .
paula , he picked valencia .
like , in front of my face .
game over .
what ?
no .
game has just begun .
okay , you have anti@@ bodies to his sali@@ va .
you can@@ not give up .
you have tr@@ action .
he@@ -@@ he touched the side of your bo@@ ob , i saw it .
- can you get whoever that ...
- yeah , i will get that .
and ... just ... let 's continue the con@@ vo later , okay ?
and if it 's the people across the street from that church , just tell them i don 't believe and will never believe .
rebecca .
hello , everyone in josh 's family .
hi .
oh , my gos@@ h .
i haven 't seen you since the last book club .
i haven 't seen you got engag@@ ed .
how does it feel ?
it feels like i 've been waiting seven years for phil@@ lip to propose , because i have .
let me see the rock .
oh , my gos@@ h , i mean ,
phil@@ lip said he was going for it , but ...
he said you were so hel@@ p@@ ful getting it .
oh , it was no problem at all .
i helped my client , mo@@ she , through a very complic@@ ated sub@@ division deal , and he said he could hook me up with non-@@ blood diam@@ on@@ ds at a dis@@ count .
and never pass up a good dis@@ count , right ?
i know what you 're thinking ...
like , diam@@ on@@ ds , dis@@ coun@@ ts , those are some like classic je@@ w moves , you know ?
what are you doing here ?
jay@@ ma has something to ask you .
look , i know that this is sudden , and we haven 't known each other that long ...
god , i feel like i 'm pro@@ pos@@ ing or something .
you 've been such a good friend to the family .
you wrote j@@ ast@@ en@@ ity that letter to get into harvard .
unfortunately the letter was better than her application , but she did get into cal state north@@ ridge , which is the harvard of north@@ ridge .
yeah , it is .
anyway , what i 'm trying to say is , how would you like to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id at my wedding ?
you mean , be an official part of the chan fam@@ -@@ bam ?
she 'd love to .
you want me to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id .
aw , you 're such a lovely girl , rebecca .
we would be so hon@@ o@@ red if you would become a part of our family wedding .
and you are the perfect he@@ ight to pair with phil@@ lip 's friend , daniel , who stopped growing after being a kid gym@@ n@@ ast .
um , actually , i-@@ i don 't know if i should .
okay , hey , why don 't we just ... ?
o-@@ one second , chan ladies .
come here .
one ...
one-@@ one second .
okay , this would kill valencia .
dead .
down in the ground .
like a bug .
legs in the air .
now she 's a ghost , bo@@ o .
okay , but , paula , what have i been saying ?
i need to dis@@ engage and dis@@ ent@@ angle from dis family .
know what i 'm saying ?
seriously , i-@@ i want to make am@@ ends to valencia , and this is like the opposite of that .
yeah , okay , well , who says no to being a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id ?
you can 't do that .
i mean , who does that ?
monster people .
- i have a question .
- no .
is valencia a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id ?
uh , not exactly .
by that she means no .
like , ew , no .
here 's the thing , i-@@ i 'd love to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id , but i don 't think it would be fair for me to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id and for valencia not to be .
i guess you 're right .
and josh has asked for valencia to be a bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id about 50 times , so ...
great , so you get what i 'm trying to say .
so you can both be in the wedding .
sorry , what 's that ?
you and valencia can both be bri@@ des@@ ma@@ ids .
that way you don 't have to worry about her not being inclu@@ ded .
very wise , jay@@ ma .
it 's settled , then .
yeah , it is !
i know you , from sp@@ ider 's .
you were the sour@@ pus@@ s fighting with the girl in the shin@@ y dress .
hey , i 'm , i 'm not a sour@@ pus@@ s .
i 'm pen@@ sive and deep .
are you dust@@ ing po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
i like to look busy .
well , you 're out of dark ro@@ ast .
i can 't study without dark ro@@ ast .
could you get on that ?
oh , yeah , sure , uh , no problem@@ o .
thanks .
she 's cute .
are we being pleasant now ?
sorry , i don 't know your rules .
so , you two an it@@ em ?
me and ally ?
oh , i wish .
she quit her job as a manager at a whole fo@@ ods , came to work here .
i could not figure out why for the long@@ est time .
and then i realized ...
hey , i know that guy .
♪ gro@@ cer@@ y cler@@ k with half an ey@@ el@@ id . ♪
his name is bro@@ dy .
i can 't com@@ pete with him .
he has the flat@@ top of a gre@@ ek god .
this !
w@@ hoa , you are so good at magic .
how do you do it ?
u@@ h-@@ u@@ h-@@ uh . a true mag@@ ic@@ ian never reve@@ als his secrets .
come on , bro@@ dy .
so you like her .
yeah .
i don 't have a shot .
i mean , look at her .
i should give up .
i know that 's the right decision .
are you sure ... she doesn 't like you ?
watch this .
ally .
ally , though .
that 's my type , too .
oh , that 's so hot .
okay , bro , i got@@ cha .
i know exactly what you need to do .
so , you and valencia are friends ?
uh , kin@@ da .
i 'd say we share a history of common interest@@ s .
of course , she 's late .
she 's the kind of person that has to make an entrance .
you know what ? i don 't think that 's fair .
i wouldn 't stere@@ oty@@ pe her as someone that ...
oh , sorry i 'm late .
i just had some pictures taken for my hom@@ et@@ own hot@@ ties sub@@ mission to max@@ im .
we ready to try on some dres@@ ses ?
jas , come on .
let 's go pick out the first round of dres@@ ses .
this is beautiful .
- hey . - w@@ hoa !
hey , valencia , hi , oh , uh , this is going to be so fun .
are you ready to be , like , bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id bud@@ dies ?
i want to make myself very , very clear .
i know what happened .
i know about the kiss .
and if it were any other situation , i would take off my ear@@ rings , my exten@@ sions , and my wings , and cur@@ b-@@ stom@@ p you .
got it , that 's fair .
but , for some reason , you 're the one that got me into this wedding party .
josh told me it was all you .
- he did ? - ye@@ p .
i mean ,
i don 't know why you did it , but i don 't care .
just stay out of my way and don 't make me look bad to these people .
hey , valencia , i can do better than that .
i can make you look good .
yeah , yeah , like , by the end of this , they 're going to want to adop@@ t you .
but maybe that 's not , like , precis@@ ely what you want , but ...
oh , just shut up .
how about this ?
this seems like a style that would work on everyone .
well , most of us .
valencia 's right .
uh , you know , uh , two-@@ piece , halter , mes@@ h dress might work well for you very lean ladies , but , yeah , not for this festival of back fat going on .
okay , well , what about ... this ?
oh , my god .
those are such beautiful nip@@ ple covers .
yeah , those would definitely cover most of my nip@@ ples .
yeah , guys , let me re@@ mind you , i eat bag@@ els at night ...
valencia knows .
she knows all about my night bag@@ els ... tell ' em , v .
here 's what you didn 't know .
for my midnight bag@@ el , i eat it with but@@ ter , cream che@@ ese , and ... bac@@ on .
seriously . s-@@ r-@@ s-@@ l-@@ y .
like , true story .
okay , so why don 't we try different styles in the same color ?
that 's a great idea .
that 's so ni ...
you know what ? i 'm gon@@ na go out on a lim@@ b and say that 's , like , really grac@@ ious .
it is , actually , a , a good idea .
so you kids can go crazy with your hal@@ ters and your she@@ ath@@ s and your cu@@ tou@@ ts , and i will wear a dress fit to u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster a chair .
and i will wear it with pride .
rebecca , come on .
yeah , you 're not that dis@@ gust@@ ingly fat .
aw , thank you , valencia .
thank you .
paula .
what have we said about standing places , quietly waiting for people ?
i forgot .
okay , so how did it go with valencia at the dress shop ?
did you find any weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
i was thinking that we could use your role as bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id to really mess her up .
my first thought was po@@ ison oak in the dress .
ras@@ hy nip@@ s , instant classic . paula .
what ?
we 're not doing any of that .
- we 're not .
- no .
we 're just acting like normal people .
i 'm going to be like any other teen@@ age ex-@@ boyfriend 's sister 's last@@ -@@ minute bri@@ des@@ ma@@ id .
yeah , so just be cool .
understood .
i have my orders .
where can a person buy po@@ ison oak , and what is the ras@@ hi@@ est kind ?
richard kind is a 5@@ 9-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old actor , best known for his role in spin city .
no . po@@ ison oak , ras@@ hi@@ est kind .
jim ras@@ h is the a@@ war@@ d-@@ win@@ ning writ@@ er of the descen@@ dants .
come on .
you 're sure this is a good idea ?
du@@ de , she doesn 't like you .
she 's sho@@ wn no interest .
she 's way into someone else .
why give up now ?
this is the right move .
um , can i have everyone 's attention , please ?
hey , someone 's trying to let it rip here .
- thank you , greg .
- you 're welcome .

problem sol@@ ved .
now , you try on the dress .
let 's see how it looks with some nice b-@@ cup action in there .
no . i couldn 't .
valencia , you 're going to make a really beautiful bride .
josh is really lucky .
i hope .
i hope some day it is josh and me , i really do .
it will be .
and i 'm so sorry if i did anything to del@@ ay that dream .
i appreciate you saying that .
do you mind taking a picture of me ?
just for me .
i want to remember how i looked .
of course .
oh , i got nothing to work with here .
i mean , i 've already h@@ acked into valencia 's e-@@ ma@@ ils and her tex@@ ts .
o@@ oh , wait a minute , what 's this ?
a photo stream ?
oh , again .
you with the face .
what do you mean , how did i get valencia 's pas@@ sword ?
you know me .
let 's see what we 've got here .
valencia 's photos ... chocolate cake ... fried chicken ...
oh , she just likes to look at food .
oh , wait a minute , what is this ?
i think that 's jay@@ ma 's wedding go@@ wn .
you know , i 've ... i 've pr@@ ayed to god my whole life , and i , and i never knew if she was listening , but ... thank you , big mama .
uh , no wr@@ ink@@ les .
- yeah , or bub@@ bles .
- thank you .
we got this .
it says i have a new like on a photo .
i-@@ i didn 't take a photo , what is this ?
you ru@@ ined my wedding .
yeah , bitch .
- how could you ?
- what 's wrong with you ?
# hot@@ ter@@ than@@ the@@ bride ?
i-@@ i-@@ i didn 't do anything .
i didn 't post a photo .
and my has@@ h@@ tag@@ s are always positive .
like , # girl@@ boss or # fit@@ sp@@ o .
someone must be fr@@ aming me or something .
what kind of psy@@ cho with no life would do such a thing ?
oh , god , paula .
you must have done it .
when i went to the bathroom .
this is why women don 't go to the bathroom alone .
excuse me , miss , i have a bone to pick with you .
i 'm sorry , sir .
can i help you ?
yes , you can .
by helping yourself .
stop chas@@ ing after the car@@ tw@@ he@@ eling mag@@ ic@@ ian idiot boy , and start pay@@ ing attention to the guy with the boun@@ ti@@ ful , beautiful hair , who happens to really care about you .
oh , you 're friends with mar@@ ty .
i pre@@ fer men@@ tor .
ah , well , i 've already told him i 'm not interested .
him continu@@ ing to chase after me is a terrible decision , which makes me respect him even less .
i mean , maybe if he backed off and let me come to him , maybe i would think about it .
otherwise , can you tell him to stop with the songs and the tex@@ ts and the sky@@ writing ?
what did you sky@@ write ?
ly@@ ric@@ s to the song .
cost a fortune .
oh , and it was so win@@ dy .
i bas@@ ically paid for a cloud .
so what 's next , coach ?
what do i do ? what 's my next move ?
i don 't know .
i kind of think we do nothing .
i like that .
like for a day ?
we slow@@ -@@ playing ?
no .
i actually think forever .
i think we got to call this one .
go back to dust@@ ing po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
you laugh , but who likes a dust@@ y po@@ tat@@ o ?
mar@@ ty , ally 's right .
chas@@ ing someone who isn 't into you is a terrible move .
trust me , i feel you .
i 've been there .
you mean you and rebecca bunch .
your friends come in here all the time talking about it .
god , i hate my friends .
yeah , mar@@ ty , that 's right .
i did that with rebecca .
but watching you do it , i see what a bad call it was .
actually , i 'm realiz@@ ing , i make a lot of bad calls ...
in everything .
yeah , me , too .
and i think we 're the same .
i mean , i work here in a gro@@ cer@@ y store , even though i went to harvard .
the harvard of what ?
just harvard .
in boston .
your decisions are just the worst .
look , i already de@@ let@@ ed it , so don 't worry .
and we only got one like and it was from ...
om@@ g , it 's from max@@ im 's hom@@ et@@ own hot@@ ties .
i 'm telling you , it was rebecca .
she 's been " single white fem@@ aling " me since she got here .
valencia ...
you take one step closer , and i 'm getting a restr@@ aining order ,
jennifer jason leigh .
what i was going to say was , um ...
you were right .
ye@@ p , it was me .
yeah .
it was my idea for valencia to put on the wedding dress , and then when i saw her in it , i-@@ i got je@@ alous .
and so i , uh , i st@@ ole her phone and i post@@ ed the picture .
i 'm sorry .
i don 't believe you .
only someone crazy and sad would do that .
um , yeah , and i 'm both those things , so i 'm , um , i 'm sorry .
valencia , i 'm sorry we acc@@ used you .
rebecca , you should go .
ye@@ p .
good@@ -@@ bye , ch@@ ans .
before you start , you don 't have to buy me champagne or a fur coat ; just a simple thank you will suff@@ ice .
paula .
valencia 's pas@@ sword was so easy .
valenci@@ a1 .
i mean , come on .
paula !
just get in my office .
i told you not to do anything .
wait , what ?
i mean , why didn 't you listen to me ?
oh , my god , why didn 't i listen to you ?
because if i listen to you , nothing would ever happen with josh .
no than@@ ks@@ giving , no camp .
no kiss .
you , you didn 't do all that by yourself .
and every time you said , " no , paula , don 't do anything . "
and then i did anyway , and you were happy .
wow , yeah , you 're right .
okay , that 's the way it used to be , but it 's not like that anymore , okay ?
no .
paula , listen to me .
i 'm done with josh .
oh , come on , i saw you .
you can 't even throw away the macar@@ oni portrait .
- i threw it away .
everything 's gone . - even chann@@ y bear .
yeah .
chann@@ y bear sle@@ eps with the f@@ ishes .
no@@ pe .
i can 't give up on josh .
he 's not yours to give up on .
why are you so hung up on this ?
it 's for you .
it-@@ it 's to make you happy .
no , it 's not , because i just told ...
it 's because ...
if we 're not chas@@ ing josh , then you 're not going to want to hang out with me anymore .
i know it .
what ?
no .
paula , no .
that 's not true .
yes . yes , it is .
he 's our glu@@ e .
he 's what holds us together , and ...
i 've barely seen you this week at all .
paula , i love you .
okay , you know that .
but we have to stop .
it 's not good for me .
you and i will always be friends , okay , i promise .
but we don 't need josh chan .
because i don 't need him .
hey . hi . i 'm sorry , i , um , i needed somewhere to drink , and i thought , i thought you 'd be at school .
you 're here .
what 'll it be ?
it 's last call .
i guess , i don 't know , i 'll take some alcohol .
do you know any alcohol names ?
yes .
i will take a pe@@ ach sch@@ nap@@ ps on the rocks ?
no , never mind .
never order drin@@ ks again .
i 'll make you something .
that 's a lot of books you got there .
yeah , i 'm trying this really new radical approach to stud@@ ying ...
it 's called stud@@ ying .
wow . is it working ?
really well .
this is perfect .
what is this ?
it 's this really ex@@ otic drink called the gin and ton@@ ic .
well , i 've never heard of a gin and ton@@ ic before , but i think it 's gon@@ na be really big .
i 'm sending in the pat@@ ent .
hey , what are you doing after this ?
do you want to , like , i don 't know , go to another bar , get a drink , or hang out at my place , or ...
what happened ?
did you and josh get in a fight ...
is that what 's going on ?
and you need a shoulder to cry on ?
so you come to greg , ' cause that 's what i do .
no , that 's not what this is .
rebecca , i would really love to hang out with you ,
i would , but i know what that lead@@ s to for me .
and i can 't .
i can 't be in second place again with you .
great .
um , good to know .
i 'm ... i 'm gon@@ na go .
i 'm gon@@ na go .
greg ?
oh , josh , i thought you were someone else , i ...
what did you do ?
y-@@ y-@@ you h@@ acked into valencia 's phone ?
y-@@ you said you were trying to keep your distance from me , a-@@ and then you do this ?
this is how you make it up to valencia ?
okay , josh , it 's a long story , but all that matters is
valencia is now bel@@ o@@ ved by your family
- and i 'm out of the bri@@ dal party .
- yeah , but ...
josh , focus on your girlfriend and on your family , okay ?
and the next time you want to come and talk to me , don 't just show up at my door .
oh ... okay .
yeah , okay , cool .
um , so could you go ?
i-@@ i-@@ i have something i need to do .
are you k@@ icking me out ?
lil ' bit .
bye , josh .
i 'm sorry , chann@@ y bear .
hey , what 's going on ?
you okay ?
what ...
no , i c ... i-@@ i can 't do this .
i-@@ i can 't eat a dust@@ y po@@ tat@@ o .
oh , god , is that what i taste like ?
i mean , i , i ate a , an old french fr@@ y off the floor of my car , but i sh ...
it 's a metap@@ hor .
wa ... you did what ?
it doesn 't matter .
no , good god , stop , woman .
greg , listen to me .
this isn 't about anyone else but you .
you 're not second choice .
i promise .
listen , if this is going to happen , - you need to know something . - okay .
this isn 't going to be like a roll in the hay and you go home .
this is going to be like three days of you and me just ru@@ in@@ ing each other .
and not emo@@ tion@@ ally .
is that what you want ?
when do we start ?
i 'm so glad we 're finally doing this .
me , too .
i mean , there 's so many girls i could have brought here , like a whole bunch , but i chose you , ashley .
- it 's ally .
- don 't care .
can we have sex now ? y@@ ay .
oh , my god .
you 're an idiot .
and you 're horrible .
why do i always make the same mistake over and over again ?
i make terrible decisions .
i go for the low@@ est form of man because i 'm afraid to be with someone i might actually connec@@ t with .
you know what ? scre@@ w this .
i 'm going back to nur@@ sing school .
wait , do you want me to do another car@@ tw@@ heel ?
i '@@ m-@@ i '@@ m-@@ i 'm good at those .
whatever .
she 'll be back .
they always come back .
and now behind the wall , the making of colon@@ y ...
my fellow colon@@ ists , welcome to day 341 of our occupation .
our choice is clear .
res@@ ist or die .
- roll sound !
- take mar@@ ker .
action !
colon@@ y , usa network 's block@@ bu@@ ster original series , is one of the most anticip@@ ated new shows of the year .
we came up with this idea of setting an occupation
- in modern day los angeles .
- it 's current .
it 's as if this happened now .
legen@@ dary television , part of the studio that produc@@ ed god@@ z@@ illa and pacific rim , and universal cable productions , the studio behind the ac@@ claimed original series , mr. robot , have te@@ amed up with cre@@ ators , carl@@ ton c@@ use ,
emmy a@@ war@@ d-@@ win@@ ning produc@@ er of lost and writ@@ er of the hit film , san andreas , and ryan con@@ dal , scre@@ en@@ writ@@ er of hercul@@ es , to bring you this comp@@ elling story of resistance and collaboration .
to be here , bringing it to life , and to see the scope and scale , it 's the most aw@@ esome part of the process .
over the next half hour , you 'll get an inside , behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes look at this intr@@ igu@@ ing new series , including inter@@ views with the cre@@ ators and cast ...
i tend to like a big story that i can 't even figure out myself .
... exclus@@ ive foot@@ age from the set and a sne@@ ak pe@@ ek at the unique and amazing world imagined by the cre@@ ators and crew .
they don 't know this yet , so just between you and me , you know , and whoever is wat@@ chin ' , we 'll let them know .
this is colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall .
get down !
you , come here !
what is this ?
what are you doing ?
- come here !
- i haven 't done anything !
you can 't do this , please !
colon@@ y is a story about occu@@ pied los angeles .
it 's about family .
it cent@@ ers around my family and our strugg@@ le to survive .
there 's been this myster@@ ious invasion by this very advanced outside party , and we don 't really know who they are , and they 've put up these giant 30@@ 0-@@ foot walls .
it 's kind of a family esp@@ ion@@ age thriller , but with some science fiction elements .
what would you do , put in this situation ?
what would you do for your children ?
what would you do for human@@ ity ?
who com@@ e-@@ who comes first ?
colon@@ y is the br@@ ain@@ child of cre@@ ators and execu@@ tive produ@@ cer@@ s ,
carl@@ ton c@@ use and ryan con@@ dal .
ryan and carl@@ ton are this kind of amazing dynam@@ ic duo .
carl@@ ton and i are both huge sy@@ fy fans , but we 're also big fans of history .
and one of the things that we both were fascin@@ ated by was paris , during nazi occupation .
we looked at a bunch of photos , and you would see these par@@ isi@@ ans , well-@@ dressed , sitting in side@@ walk caf@@ es , si@@ pping es@@ pres@@ sos , while nazi stor@@ m@@ tro@@ oper@@ s were going by in the street .
we thought that was a really interesting and incon@@ gru@@ ous image , that people were trying so hard to kind of keep the normal@@ cy of their lives under this incredi@@ bly re@@ pres@@ sive regime .
it just fascin@@ ated us , and we wondered ,
" well , what would that look like in-@@ in our city , wh@@ ere-@@ where we both live ? "
and we talked to legen@@ dary about it .
they loved it .
we set it up with usa .
and then we made the pilot last year .
and now , here we are , making a series .
legen@@ dary makes their first for@@ ay into television drama , with colon@@ y , and br@@ ings together a stell@@ ar cast , led by josh hol@@ lo@@ way of lost .
carl@@ ton called me , like ,
" i have an offer you can 't refuse . "
and sarah wayne cal@@ lies of the walking dead .
it 's a story i believe in .
it 's a character that i 've never seen before .
the ac@@ claimed cast also inclu@@ des thre@@ e-@@ time emmy win@@ ner , ka@@ thy baker , of pick@@ et fen@@ ces ,
peter jacob@@ son of house ,
amanda righ@@ etti of the ment@@ alist ,
true detective 's tory kit@@ t@@ les ,
carl we@@ ath@@ ers of rocky fame ...
apollo cre@@ ed !
... and paul guil@@ fo@@ yle of c@@ si .
we feel like we 've really got some great ac@@ tors on our show .
we were kin@@ da just with the charac@@ ters .
we 're sort of seeing the world through their eyes .
you have this world in which these people , who maybe were neighbor@@ s at one time , find themselves at od@@ ds with each other .
let me go !
one of the things about reading the script , it made me think about , how far you 'd be willing to go to res@@ ist .
it was a pilot that was about family , and about people making really , really difficult cho@@ ices .
for people to come back , week to week , it all beg@@ ins and ends with the charac@@ ters .
everything has suddenly been he@@ igh@@ tened , and the cho@@ ices that you make , who you side with , who you choose to trust , who trust@@ s you , become massi@@ vely important for your day@@ -@@ to-@@ day surviv@@ al .
it 's a polit@@ ical environ@@ ment .
everything you do has a polit@@ ical compon@@ ent .
thro@@ ugh@@ out human history , we 've either occu@@ pied someone , or been occu@@ pied by someone else .
it 's sho@@ cking what human be@@ ings will do in these situ@@ ations .
what would you do to survive ?
what are the comprom@@ ises you would make ?
what are the things that you would be capable of doing ?
good morning .
good morning .
you stin@@ k .
and you , you stin@@ k .
at the center of the show , is the bow@@ mann family .
will is a former fbi agent , forced underground by the occupation .
all the people who were police , and authority figures , military , was wiped out during the arri@@ val , and will was smart enough to go underground .
he and his wife , katie , must navig@@ ate this new world , where freedom no longer exist@@ s , and the consequences for dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence are dead@@ ly .
get up !
let 's go .
their relationship is already complic@@ ated .
they have true love at the core .
yet , they 've lost a child .
will and katie have three kids , but only two of them are living with them right now , ' cause their son , charlie , was caught on the other side of the wall when these myster@@ ious inv@@ ad@@ ers showed up .
and that 's frac@@ turing the family in various ways .
it 's bad enough he 's gone , but to see you every day hat@@ ing me for it .
i don 't hate you for it .
will and katie are desperate to get their kid back .
and so , will hi@@ red this guy to s@@ mug@@ g@@ le him into santa monica , to res@@ cue charlie .
you 'll be my 38@@ th run .
you got no@@ thin ' to worry about .
hop in .
you have entered the exclus@@ ion zone .
remain inside your vehicle until otherwise direc@@ ted .
my box kil@@ ls x-@@ ray and ther@@ mal .
they 'll never know we were here .
fre@@ eze !
hands where we can see them !
- get ' em up !
- move , now !
- stay where you are !
- on your knees !
keep ' em up !
put your hands behind your head !
medi@@ c !
get me a medi@@ c , now !
coming up , on colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall ...
find out how the show 's cre@@ ators built the world of occu@@ pied los angeles utiliz@@ ing fir@@ st@@ hand ac@@ coun@@ ts ...
juan , our director , grew up in argentina , under a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship .
... state of the art effec@@ ts technology .
story always comes first .
the visual effec@@ ts are a way to aug@@ ment and help tell that story .
... and good , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned hollywood magic .
hey !
where is my phone call ?
- let me out !
- i want my phone call .
- step back !
- i need to call my wife .
agh !
occu@@ pied los angeles is a world very much like our own ...
there 's blue sky .
there 's palm trees .
there 's good weather .
... with some e@@ erie differ@@ ences .
there 's an un@@ scal@@ able wall that surro@@ unds the city .
show cre@@ ators , production design@@ ers , and visual effec@@ ts speci@@ alist@@ s com@@ bine with cast and crew to bring this incredi@@ ble world to life .
colon@@ y is this kin@@ da wonderful bl@@ end of-@@ of elements that give you a-@@ a really unique look on what life in los angeles would be like if we were actually occu@@ pied .
this world 's just that ten per@@ cent different enough to really kind of make you sit back and say , " w@@ hoa .
what@@ -@@ what 's happened here ? "
the show p@@ icks up nearly a year after the arri@@ val .
a cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic invasion that changed everything .
every defense appar@@ atus was wiped out within eight hours .
all of a sudden ,
los angeles and its millions of cit@@ iz@@ ens , their lives were completely turned up@@ side down .
many were killed , many were taken away .
one of the first things that happened after the arri@@ val is , pretty much all the cars went away .
so , this is a very different los angeles .
a lot of people are on foot or riding bic@@ y@@ cles , so it has this very kind of paris@@ ian feel to the city .
we tried to kin@@ da come up with this idea that beauty and op@@ pression could co-@@ ex@@ ist .
you know , los angeles could look pretty and invit@@ ing , but , at the same time , it 's clearly now a host@@ ile environ@@ ment .
what 's great about what carl@@ ton and ryan have done in the concept , is just that idea of isol@@ ating it , fen@@ cing in group@@ s of people , cre@@ ates this tension .
slowly , but surely , you 're feeling what it is to be op@@ pressed .
i 'm a st@@ ick@@ ler for the-@@ for the logic of , uh , of the occupation , and of a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship , and how this ment@@ ality works .
i grew up in argentina , uh , during the ' 70@@ s , where we had a dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship .
a ver@@ y-@@ - a-@@ a pretty rough one , but that a lot of the society was for it .
and i can see that happening very easily in america .
was an explosion at the santa monica gat@@ e@@ way , yesterday .
it was the resistance .
- those terror@@ ists wo@@ unded at least ten people .
- thank you .
who knows how many more they killed ?
we were going for a look that had a much more document@@ ary style .
we really wanted to make it look and feel very real .
that this could really be happening .
it 's very hand@@ held , and , you know , many times , we@@ -@@ we stag@@ ed the scene , without any specif@@ ic instruc@@ tions to the camera oper@@ ators .
and then we just put , you know , the three camer@@ as , as if they were a news team that are co@@ vering the scene for the first time .
uh , so it feels very immedi@@ ate , very real .
the production designer is in charge of the look of the tv show .
i 'm responsible for all of the things in front of the camera .
from building the sets to decor@@ ating the sets .
the sets are beautiful , which , right away , for an actor , that put@@ s you in a good place .
so , the yon@@ k is my bar .
this bar .
the yon@@ k is short for yo@@ kn@@ ap@@ at@@ aw@@ pha , which took me some time to learn how to say .
- thank you , ryan .
- i love the yon@@ k .
it 's kind of a bar that has a southern vi@@ be to it .
it definitely feels real .
oh , well , look who made it after all !
oh , you think i 'd miss the opportunity to drink public@@ ly for the first time in 11 months ?
as a designer , i was kind of excited about all of the kin@@ da graphic qualit@@ ies to it .
resistance poster@@ s , and poster@@ s that are more like pro-@@ occupation .
by the visu@@ als of what we put on the screen , we 're telling the audience where you are .
the visual effec@@ ts are a huge part , uh , of this show .
we have this tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous visual effec@@ ts partner , in ghost , who is our , uh , visual effec@@ ts studio , out of , uh , copen@@ hagen , in denmark .
they visu@@ aliz@@ ed an amazing pilot .
our walls , the 30@@ 0-@@ foot walls that sur@@ round los angeles , are an entirely digital creation , as are the dr@@ ones that pat@@ rol the ski@@ es .
yeah , the dr@@ ones ar@@ e-@@ - th-@@ they are little charac@@ ters of their own right .
th-@@ they are , essenti@@ ally , acting .
they 're in pat@@ rol mode , in se@@ ek and destroy mode .
in mo@@ des that we don 't know what they 're really thinking .
even though they 're mechan@@ ical , and they 're just w@@ hiz@@ z@@ ing around , you 'll actually see , they have different person@@ alit@@ ies .
ryan ge@@ eks out on all the science fiction stuff .
like , he was showing me pictures of dr@@ ones , and we were jum@@ ping up and down like children .
you know , it was like , yes !
i 've always wanted to be in battle@@ star gal@@ ac@@ tica , and , like , star wars , and all these amazing shows , and we get to do stuff like that .
the most difficult thing for ac@@ tors is trying to imagine elements such as dr@@ ones that they 've never even seen .
and my role is to ass@@ ist them to imagine this world .
we need to make sure that eye lines are correct , and they are actually looking at a dr@@ one that is somewhere that we 're not seeing in real life .
so , it 's especially challen@@ ging on a blue screen , or a green screen as well .
the tou@@ gh@@ est thing is , really , it 's the cars .
los angeles is a very busy city .
well known for , uh , its greatest ex@@ port ,
- which is traffic .
- to clean up these roads , and to make it look like we 're in a no-@@ car environ@@ ment , is really , really difficult .
so , we lock down lan@@ es of traffic as much as possible .
we pick off little pieces from our plate sho@@ ts that don 't have traffic in them , and it 's a really pain@@ ful process of painting them out .
- fire in the hole !
- action !
today is probably the@@ -- one of the big@@ gest sho@@ ts .
we 're gon@@ na have bullet hits .
uh , alien dr@@ ones w@@ hiz@@ z@@ ing in from the background .
next week , we 're , uh , blo@@ wing up an entire house .
each week , we get more and more excit@@ ing effec@@ ts .
coming up , on colon@@ y-@@ - behind the wall , we 'll expl@@ ore occu@@ pied los angeles , and disco@@ ver the challen@@ ges faced by its cit@@ iz@@ ens .
if you 're re@@ sour@@ ce@@ ful and cle@@ ver , you can survive this occupation .
both the collabor@@ ators ...
there 's no victory to be had against these people .
what there is , is com@@ promise .
... and the resistance .
there 's a lot of fear and con@@ ster@@ nation go@@ in ' on .
that 's a good word , " con@@ ster@@ nation . "
con@@ ster@@ nation in-@@ in the colon@@ y .
i like it .
as you dig deeper into colon@@ y , you 'll disco@@ ver the op@@ pres@@ sive new world under which the cit@@ iz@@ ens of los angeles are forced to live .
there 's no communication .
there 's no internet .
there 's no cell phone service .
there 's no information that goes outside of these walls .
i 'm look@@ in ' for will bow@@ mann .
are you will bow@@ mann ?
sullivan .
ah@@ h !
not anymore .
los angeles is now under marti@@ al law .
a giant wall separ@@ ates the city into three blo@@ cks , each administ@@ ered by a prox@@ y government .
there 's santa monica , there 's the los angeles block , and there 's the san fernando valley block .
- where are you taking me ?
- green zone .
in the la block , where our charac@@ ters live , you either live in the flat@@ s or you live in the green zone .
the green zone is the more privil@@ eg@@ ed area , where the people that collabor@@ ate with the transit@@ ional authority live .
the hollywood hills and bel air , all those houses have been taken over and are occu@@ pied by the new elite .
they 're leading very nice , lux@@ ur@@ ious lives , wh@@ ere@@ as the regular cit@@ iz@@ ens are not .
they 're subject to r@@ ations and re@@ pression .
the show sort of explo@@ res that dich@@ otom@@ y .
i 'm the prox@@ y gover@@ nor of our little block here .
why am i here ?
to turn crisis into opportunity .
i take question with the fact that he 's a bad guy .
he collabor@@ ates with a clean conscience because i think that s@@ ny@@ der belie@@ ves truly that he is a force for good change .
wait@@ -@@ wait@@ -@@ wait .
hold on .
you can '@@ t-@@ - ah@@ h !
after the arri@@ val , the occupation government estab@@ l@@ ished their own police force , which the cit@@ iz@@ ens re@@ fer to as the red house .
they run ads , just like army ads . they 're tr@@ yin ' to re@@ cru@@ it people to control other people .
there 's a military cur@@ few in effect every night .
the things that you used to take for gr@@ ant@@ ed , like walking down the street to go get a cup of coffee , are not so easy anymore .
you don 't know , at any given moment , whether you might get ha@@ ul@@ ed out of your house and taken away , never to be seen again .
my brother got sent up .
the factory .
what is the factory they keep talking about ?
is it a concentration camp ?
nobody really knows what the factory is , or what it 's making , but what we do know is , is that people who go to the factory don 't ever come back .
in opposition to this new total@@ it@@ arian regime , stands the resistance .
a shado@@ wy group of figh@@ ters led by the myster@@ ious ger@@ onimo .
the resistance wants very much to end this occupation .
these are just every@@ day men and women whose lives have been turned up@@ side down .
people are willing to risk their lives to make change .
- a revolution .
- down !
how big is the resistance ?
who runs it ?
what 's their grand plan ?
how organiz@@ ed are they ?
those are all myster@@ ies that are a part of the show .
our host@@ s are tired of the insur@@ gen@@ cy .
you want me to collabor@@ ate .
in@@ filtr@@ ate the insur@@ gen@@ cy and bring us their leader .
does he agree with resist@@ ing ?
yes , but they 're going about it in the wrong way .
they 're getting innocent people killed .
am@@ id@@ st these war@@ ring fac@@ tions ,
will and katie strugg@@ le to keep their family safe .
they try to live their life the way they had before it was ripped out from under them .
family in a world like this takes on a new prim@@ acy .
ma@@ del@@ ine 's living with them , her sister .
and hudson , ma@@ del@@ ine 's son .
for mad@@ die , finding insul@@ in for her son is-@@ is one of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges .
certain conditions are de@@ em@@ ed un@@ wor@@ thy for treat@@ ment .
diab@@ etes is one of ' em .
this has to be kept cold .
it 's way too hot in here .
what do you think you 're do@@ in ' ?
- i 'm not bu@@ ying insul@@ in .
- a trade is a trade !
whether it 's trying to buy something on the black market , or whether it 's being out at the wrong place after the cur@@ few sir@@ ens sound , the world is full of all these per@@ ils that never exist@@ ed before ,
and our charac@@ ters are trying to navig@@ ate their way through this and survive .
if you can 't help me , then you and your wife , and your children , you 'll all be sent to the factory .
the most important day in human history is coming .
i just want you and your family to be on the right side of it .
the audience will learn more about who these myster@@ ious inv@@ ad@@ ers are , what they want , what they 're up to , what their powers are .
there are all these sort of lay@@ ers to the show that will be explo@@ red over time .
coming up , find out how the cast answers the question , collabor@@ ate or res@@ ist ?
i don 't know if i would have the courage to risk my children .
and the cre@@ ators give us a special sne@@ ak pe@@ ek of a scene from the premiere episode .
- don 't tell him .
- yeah .
don '@@ t- - just because he asked nic@@ ely doesn 't mean
- you 're gon@@ na tell .
- keep watching .
camer@@ as and mar@@ ker .
actor number two , action !
colon@@ y , usa network 's new original series , is a high-@@ st@@ akes drama about survi@@ ving in a new world .
it 's an old human story , but this is un@@ like any enemy we 've faced before .
these charac@@ ters , they come up against all sor@@ ts of dil@@ em@@ mas about , what are some of the comprom@@ ises that we need to make in order to survive ?
who are you , deep down ?
what kind of character do you have ?
and what would you do for your family ?
the charac@@ ters in colon@@ y must walk the fine line between collaboration and resistance .
nothing and no one is what they seem .
you don 't know who to trust .
we lie to everyone .
we lie to protect our@@ selves .
why are they collabor@@ ating ?
what is at st@@ ake for them ?
and that is the beauty of this show .
it 's a charac@@ ter-@@ dri@@ ven study of perspec@@ tives .
and now , here 's an exclus@@ ive sne@@ ak pe@@ ek at a scene from colon@@ y .
please , no !
no !
get off me !
get off !
usa network , legen@@ dary television , and cre@@ ators and execu@@ tive produ@@ cer@@ s ,
carl@@ ton c@@ use and ryan con@@ dal , have created the next great television drama .
all great stories are , at their core , human stories .
we get to take a fantast@@ ic universe and use it to ex@@ amine the contempor@@ ary issues of our own world .
it 's about humans batt@@ ling humans .
it 's about the things we 're capable of doing to each other .
it foc@@ uses on that un@@ break@@ able family bond .
big , heavy , moral decisions .
revolution .
we 're not telling you who 's right and who 's wrong .
there 's no black and white hat@@ s .
there are red hat@@ s .
kind of end up with this bit of a cas@@ ablanca story .
it 's this cross@@ roads of the world , where different people from all walks ,
occupation , and resistance .
and then the people that are just caught in between , trying to survive .
hope@@ fully , it 'll put yourself in the shoes of our charac@@ ters and our show , and you 'll wan@@ na ask the fundamental questions .
like , would i collabor@@ ate ?
would i be in the resistance ?
what lies outside the la block ?
is the world destroy@@ ed ?
it 's all a mystery , and that 's the fun of the show .
these are things we 'll have to disco@@ ver .
all of this , it 's tempor@@ ary .
once they 've satisfied their needs , they 'll leave .
what needs ?
colon@@ y premieres thur@@ s@@ day , janu@@ ary 14@@ th , at 10 / 9 central , only on usa .
the time has come to make your choice .
do you collabor@@ ate or res@@ ist ?
that 's a heavy question .
it 's easy for any@@ body to sit and say ,
" i 'd do this " or " i 'd do that . "
- i res@@ ist . - i might collabor@@ ate , if i got to make television shows .
i would like to think that i would res@@ ist .
i would really take my time to make that decision .
i may be a huge co@@ ward .
i have no idea .
when ya can 't beat ' em , join ' em .
collabor@@ ate and die .
i would do whatever it took to save my family .
anything .
finding a job where you get to work side by side with your friends can be the best .
it can also be the worst .
i came in with two friends !
thank you !
my name is cooper bar@@ rett .
my friends and i are here to mess up our lives so you don 't have to .
_
- yeah !
- yeah !
- to our succes@@ s .

because of us , everyone from your cas@@ ual char@@ don@@ nay si@@ pper to your har@@ den@@ ed alco@@ hol@@ ic is wak@@ ing up to a better american morning .
this is how dr. pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin must have felt when he created the what@@ -@@ cha@@ -@@ ma-@@ cal@@ l-@@ it .
there are so many things wrong with that statement .
- who are you looking for ?
- i was hoping my girl kelly would be here so we could hang out , ' cause , you know , we have a thing .
oh , like a pat@@ ty from college thing ?
no , there can never be another pat@@ ty .

there 's no this .
- so i can sleep with her .
- no !
listen .
solid girl@@ friends do not come easy to me , and i don 't want you and your pen@@ is mes@@ sing it up .
okay , first of all , she hasn 't even expres@@ sed any interest .
and second , if she did , and i went through with it , i hope you know i respect you enough to never tell you about it .
fine , i won 't sleep with her . thank you .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .
hi . i 'm cooper bar@@ rett .

_
pretty great , right ?
can 't buy public@@ ity like that . free samp@@ le .
oh , thanks . this makes it seem like you run the company by yourself . yeah , you don 't even mention us one time in this whole thing .
" barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure , " not cooper 's .
your grand@@ ma hasn 't been hun@@ go@@ ver a day in her life !
come on , guys , let 's focus on the big picture , all right ?
that company , hang@@ ender , won this award three years in a row , and we just beat them . it 's not about individual credit . plus , i would have sung your pr@@ aises
- if i was given the opportunity .
- " when asked how he was able
" to accompl@@ ish so much , he cre@@ d@@ ited the inspiration of steve jobs and a good night 's sleep . "
yeah , you 're right . that was my window , i blew it .
- i 'm sorry . i ...
- " and later , he wished to thank
" his two best friends : hard work
- and determin@@ ation . "
- oh , guys , i mes@@ sed up .
but it was a phone interview . i mean , you guys know i value you and your ideas .
yeah , hold that thought .
get your free samp@@ le .
barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure ?
- i 've heard that stuff 's made in an apartment , and you can taste pi@@ g fec@@ es .
what ?
where 'd you hear that ?
" barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure is made in an apartment with pi@@ g fec@@ es . "
that 's simply un@@ true .
i mean , he hasn 't had an accident in weeks .
i mean , if they would have said pi@@ g ur@@ ine ...
there 's comm@@ ents from this cooper@@ su@@ cks person all over the net .
obviously , the person who 's post@@ ing this has inside information , so they can do serious damage to our business , if they haven 't already .
okay , so how do we find out who this cooper@@ su@@ ck@@ s@@ 69 is ?
i 'm one step ahead of you , sir .
i 've trac@@ ed the ip address , and it looks like it 's someone ... in our apartment building .
- what do you want ?
- hey , vir@@ gil .
uh ... someone 's been trol@@ ling barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure online .
uh , you wouldn 't happen to know anything about that , would you ?
what is ... trol@@ ling ?
uh , it means people are making fun of us on the internet .
o@@ oh . which site do i do that ?
we 're not telling you to do that .
oh , i 'll find out .
i have so many " barry 's grand@@ ma 's so fat " jo@@ kes .
what ?
!
do you really think mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly is our trol@@ l ?
she 's , like , 90 years old .
well , we have to cross everyone in the building off our list .
you know what ?
i haven 't seen her in a few weeks . come to think of it , neither have i .
well , at least she led a good life .
actually , i think she collabor@@ ated in the armen@@ ian gen@@ oci@@ de . but still , ne@@ at lady .
i don 't get it . we 've checked every apartment .
well , not every apartment .
i can 't believe it .
i never would 've suspected it .
what are you guys doing in my apartment ?
welcome home ...
kelly .
or should we say , cooper@@ su@@ ck@@ s@@ 69 ?
wait .
were the first 68 cooper@@ su@@ cks already taken ?
this is impossible .
had anyone else in your apartment rec@@ ently ?
- any male visit@@ ors , perhaps ?
- or pol@@ ter@@ geist@@ s ?
i seen this episode of ghost h@@ unter@@ s where this one ghost went into this one du@@ de 's account and mes@@ sed up his credit . spo@@ ok@@ y .
no guys or ghost@@ s have been in my apartment .
i 'm the only one who uses this computer .
oh , and ram@@ ona .
wait , wait , wait , hold up . say ram@@ ona 's last name is miller .
- right ?
- you 're already for@@ getting her name .
you slept with her , didn 't you ? !
- you said she was a trainer ?
- yeah . so ?
because ram@@ ona miller is not a personal trainer .
she is the president and ceo of hang@@ ender , our main compet@@ it@@ or .
what ?
she clearly saw us as a threat , posed to be your friend , just to get in@@ fo about us to try to take us down !
to think , i almost slept with her .
come to think of it , she was asking a lot of questions about your company .
why the hell you tell her about our pi@@ g fec@@ es ?
why are you living in an apartment with pi@@ g fec@@ es ?
it 's stin@@ king up the entire building .
i think that smell was mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly .
what happened to mrs. bil@@ ling@@ sly ?
honey ,
- i 'm so sorry .
- oh , my god !
i lose two of my best girl@@ friends in one day ? i 'm gon@@ na punch ram@@ ona in her lying , f@@ law@@ less face !
best plan is to get even .
i have an idea how to do that .
so do i , so what we do is ...
we all listen to ne@@ al because i value his ideas .
- really ?
- m@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
thanks , co@@ op .
okay , kelly , first , you 're gon@@ na take ram@@ ona out to brun@@ ch .

can i just say , i am really enjoying your neil de@@ gras@@ se ty@@ son .
it is fun and informat@@ ive .
you know what else is fun ?
the mil@@ ky way .
no , you already used that one .
plu@@ to is one-@@ third water . there he is !
this fan@@ cy hotel looks a lot like a b@@ iker bar .
it 's like an episode of sons of anarch@@ y that doesn 't end well .
i 'm pretty sure there is no episodes of sons of anarch@@ y
- i 'm telling you , this is the address list@@ ed on ram@@ ona 's work order .
this is cooper .
hey , cooper .
this is ram@@ ona miller .
- i 'm actually ...
- the president and ceo
- of hang@@ ender . i know exactly who ...
- who i am ?
i know that you know , but here 's something you don 't know .
that order you took from me was a f@@ ake .
- what order ?
- mor@@ on , give it up . i 've been one step ahead of you this whole time .
you may be easy on the eyes , but that doesn 't mean that you know how to run a business .
first rule is , don 't ever work with your friends .
second rule is shut up .
you 're obviously fla@@ iling here . let me put you out of your mis@@ ery and buy your company from you .
you didn 't listen to the second rule .
h@@ mm .
we 've been set up .
let 's get out of here before we get our@@ selves killed .
ye@@ p .
that was a close one .
okay . hi . there 's so many of you .
okay .
- hi , guys . hi .
- uh , okay .
hey , guys .
what are you doing ?
they gon@@ na kill us anyway .
- he 's not with us !
- sorry !
my must@@ ache fell off when they threw me through that window .
mercury has ...
damn !
all my space fac@@ ts are gone , ne@@ al !
okay .
tell me everything .
did you ru@@ b it in ram@@ ona 's face yet ?
uh , things didn 't exactly work out .
ram@@ ona tr@@ icked us into going to a b@@ iker bar , and ...
come on , cooper .
tell everybody what you 're really thinking .
what am i really thinking ?
" uh , the reason i don 't listen to your ideas , ne@@ al , is " because the one time that i do , we get ou@@ ts@@ mar@@ ted by a rival " and thrown through a window .
" maybe , ne@@ al , instead of compl@@ aining " that you don 't get enough credit , you should acknow@@ ledge
" that i 'm the br@@ ains of the operation . just sit your ner@@ dy face down in front of a computer ! "
- easy , cooper .
- " and you , you big bastard , get your ass back in the kitchen and handle the produc@@ t ! "
you know what , cooper , you 've gone too far !
i 'm out !
- i hope you 're happy .
- i didn 't even say anything .
okay , i don 't even know who 's y@@ elling at who here , but we need to focus on ram@@ ona .
so there 's no truth to what i said ?
- well , it was your plan . but ...
- oh , my god .
some words you can 't take back , cooper !
you have to go after ne@@ al .
don 't you see ?
divi@@ ding you guys like this , this is exactly ram@@ ona 's plan .
okay .
i think you 're giving her a little too much credit .
- hey , ne@@ al .
- oh , my god .
i heard you 're un@@ happy with cooper .
mm . yeah , it 's not going well .
you should 've heard the things he said to me .
you know that i think you 're incredi@@ bly impres@@ sive and that i value what you do .
thank you .
what is it that i do ?
the vir@@ al marketing .
your web site . the entire dat@@ ab@@ ase you set up was brilli@@ ant .
your idea for paj@@ ama tu@@ es@@ days .
full dis@@ clo@@ sure , i just didn 't feel like wearing clothes that day .
we could really use your skil@@ ls at hang@@ ender . and ... this would be your starting sal@@ ary .
i 'm sorry , is this some sort of joke ?
i mean , cooper and i are best friends .
i 'm not gon@@ na let one little pet@@ ty f ...
this is hang@@ ender .
- you 've reached ne@@ al f@@ iss@@ ley 's office .
- oh , louise ?
can you confir@@ m my mas@@ sage will be on a table and not one of those airport chairs ?
and , uh , i 'm out of lol@@ lipo@@ ps , so ... thank you .
i can 't let her get away with taking ne@@ al .
i 'll help you get her back , but it could get ugly .
she pulls a knife , you pull a gun .
she put@@ s one of yours in the hospital , you put one of hers in the mor@@ gue .
oh , i 've been dying to use that line from the un@@ touch@@ ables since ' 87 . may not have been worth it .
it 's not about reven@@ ge , okay ? it 's about business .
and if i want to succe@@ ed , i got to beat ram@@ ona at her own game .
well , what are you prepared to do , cooper ?
- that 's not hel@@ p@@ ful . - welcome to the rock .
- hello , ram@@ ona .
- hey , cooper .
if you 're looking for a job , i 'm afraid ne@@ al 's
- already hi@@ red an assistant .
- that 's not why i 'm here .
oh , good , because the girl who got the job
- is way more quali@@ fied than you .
- if you 're done ,
i have a little pro@@ pos@@ al for you :
you give me ne@@ al back , and i 'll forgive the attack on my company and i promise
counter@@ pro@@ pos@@ al :
i keep ne@@ al , ban@@ krup@@ t your company , and you come back to my place and we get rid of the sexual tension between us .
interesting idea .
let me consider / fantas@@ ize about that for a second .
not gon@@ na lie , that was amazing . but i still have to rej@@ ect your offer .
that 's too bad .
i have lots of mir@@ r@@ ors , and i had a terrible chil@@ d@@ hood .
listen , ram@@ ona , you have no idea what you 're up against .
i think i have a pretty good idea .
you may have ne@@ al , but i have a better produc@@ t .
and i still have barry san@@ del .
hi , barry .
i wanted to discus@@ s ... look , i know why you 're here and i 'm not interested .
but if you could just hear me out for one second , i think ...
it 's my grandmother 's sweat and tears in this cure , okay ?
liter@@ ally . that 's the two main ing@@ redi@@ ents .
look , i know cooper likes to ho@@ g all the credit and he called me a big bastard , but at the end of the day , we are still friends .
our break room has a mil@@ k@@ shake machine .
this is hang@@ ender . barry san@@ del 's office . hang@@ ender rules !
totally .
louise !
why am i seeing the bottom of my lol@@ li@@ pop jar ?
- thank you . - all right , josh , let 's get ugly .
co@@ yote ugly .
it was on after the un@@ touch@@ ables .
weird double fe@@ ature .
star@@ z is the best .
- all right , let 's go .
- yeah .
it 's not gon@@ na work .
- we should 've gone with my plan .
- oh , yeah . three stin@@ k bom@@ bs and a " ram@@ ona su@@ cks ! " bann@@ er .
you know what , we 'll do that right after we tp her house and leave a bag of po@@ o on the front step .
i love that . one t@@ weak : fire .
what 's going on ?
just whi@@ pping up tons of the cure for be@@ v con .
it 's a bever@@ age conference .
we already have a better produc@@ t and if we can out@@ sell ram@@ ona at be@@ v con , her company will be destroy@@ ed and our company 's rise will be document@@ ed in the next lit@@ t@@ le-@@ seen aaron sor@@ kin film .
" our company " ?
you 're the only one left in your company . okay , i don 't need those guys . i was doing everything anyway .
i can 't read barry 's writing . does this say " cin@@ nam@@ on " or " cyan@@ ide " ?
you should probably just assume cin@@ nam@@ on .
oh , oh , oh . check it out .
♪ dun , dun , dun ♪
- jel@@ ly be@@ ans .
- oh .
what 's in this one ?
gum@@ my wor@@ ms !
josh , can we just focus ?
i need you to ... cho@@ p up 400 on@@ ions and then , uh , throw half of them away .
- what ?
- it 's barry 's process , so ...
cooper , the reason you got into this company is so you could build something great with your friends .
maybe you should go and apologi@@ ze .
it 's too late .
they made their choice .
i came here because cooper is too stub@@ born ...
what ?
!
i came here because cooper is too stub@@ born to tell you how much he needs you guys .
and you need him .
i don 't need anything except for my mil@@ k@@ shak@@ es deli@@ vered fre@@ ez@@ ing cold !
i 'm talking 32 de@@ gre@@ es fahren@@ heit , scot@@ tie , okay ?
that 's fahren@@ heit !
- son of a bitch .
- guys ,
ram@@ ona doesn 't value your ideas .
she just brought you here to under@@ mine cooper .
i went and looked at your offic@@ es ... you don 't even have compu@@ ters !
yeah , ' cause our assist@@ ants take dic@@ tation ... of our lunch orders and our dreams and cool inven@@ tions that we have .
hey , kelly .
nice to see you .
oh ...
that 's the spirit .
ram@@ ona , kelly seems to you think that we 're just pa@@ wns and that you actually don 't value our ideas . that 's ridiculous .
okay , name one of them .
um ...
like the commercial we did about the girls in bik@@ inis talking to girls in bik@@ inis . bik@@ ini-@@ bik@@ ini .
no . that 's terrible .
- i worked two days on that .
- that was cream of the cro@@ p .
okay , fine , you 're pa@@ wns .
but you 're well-@@ paid pa@@ wns with offic@@ es and assist@@ ants .
kelly .
due to recent events , this mil@@ k@@ shake has become less del@@ icious .
it 's still a free mil@@ k@@ shake .
that 's true .
- you guys are worse than cooper .
- what ?
!
and he 's the worst .
- huh ?
!
- huh ?
!
cu@@ res your hang@@ over .
yes , hang@@ ender ends the hang in the hang@@ over , in the hang@@ over .
- hang@@ ender !
hang@@ ender !
- hey , guys .
you 're doing great .
just stay in cooper 's ey@@ eline and remember ...
don 't talk to any@@ body .
don 't touch anything .
perfect .
barry 's grand@@ ma 's hang@@ over cure is made from an ag@@ e-@@ old reci@@ pe .
comes straight from a real grandmother who used to get hun@@ go@@ ver quite a bit , so ...
okay , just , uh ...
so how many cas@@ es do you guys want ?
uh ...
guys , i 'm really going to need you to step it up .
we 're working for free . and i 'm drunk from the hard lem@@ on@@ ade bo@@ oth .
would you like bro@@ chu@@ res ?
you were right .
i 'll be right back .
hey , guys . just , uh , wanted to say that i should 've given you guys more credit for everything you did for the company and i 'm really glad you guys landed somewhere great .
cooper , we 're kind of busy right now .
okay , understood .
just ...
just as long as we ...
call scot@@ tie and set up an ap@@ pointment .
okay .
everyone .
welcome , everyone .
as you all know , hang@@ over cu@@ res are becoming a bil@@ lion dollar industry , and we 've got the best one in the business .
my wonderful team has worked ti@@ re@@ lessly to bring you this incredi@@ ble video that will introdu@@ ce you to our brand . a video ?
oh , come on .
hang@@ ender was fo@@ unded by president and ceo ram@@ ona miller in 2011 after a bach@@ elo@@ rette party gone wrong in las vegas .
oh , yeah , they 're happy .
- she looks good .
- hang@@ ender is made from only the fresh@@ est and natural ing@@ redi@@ ents .
fresh ber@@ ries , fig@@ s , pu@@ bic hair , fil@@ th from humans and pi@@ g 's po@@ op .
what ?
wait .
what 's going on ?
ew !
ram@@ ona miller does not care about black people .
no !
i love black people .
what ?
oh , that 's not okay .
turn it off . turn it off ! and ...
hang@@ over cu@@ res for life .
move out of the way !
get out of here .
- it 's the best .
- that 's right .
who came up with that ?
what are you talking about ?
we did .
of course you did .
- that was a great idea , man .
- that was amazing .
all right , let 's get back to work . let 's get back to work .
- all right .
let 's go .
- y@@ ay !
- oh , hi . come on , come on , come on . - ga@@ ther round , ga@@ ther round .
this has no pu@@ bic hair in it .
no po@@ o .
hey , guys .
i just wanted you to meet my new best girlfriend , ren@@ ee .
my name is sha@@ w@@ na .
we have tons in common and we 're pretty much in@@ separ@@ able best@@ ies .
uh , you must be josh .
no . no that one . kelly .
did you meet ren@@ ee ?
look at her .
you 're so lucky .
ram@@ ona turned out to be , like , a ru@@ th@@ less shar@@ k , but she got hers .
so you and ram@@ ona aren 't friends anymore ?
you 're free to hang out ?
- yeah , of course .
- oh , cool .
ren@@ ee , i 'm going to have to ask you to leave .
it 's sha@@ w@@ na .
why are you still here ?
girls can be so cl@@ ing@@ y .
so , working with friends ... it can be hard but it can be done .
all you have to do is admit when you 're wrong and more import@@ antly than anything , admit when they 're right . and don 't let your pi@@ g ba@@ the in your hang@@ over cure . and maybe don 't own a pi@@ g .
ram@@ ona .
are you , uh , here to ap@@ ply for the bar@@ tender position ?
no , i came to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you guys on be@@ v con and to ask how you 'd feel about join@@ ing forces .
- absolutely not .
- what ?
- she 's crazy .
- welcome to the rock .
the bottom line is you guys have the better produc@@ t but you don 't have the re@@ sources to get it out there .
i do and i think together we 'd be un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
what do you say ?
i don 't know .
i have to ask my part@@ ners .
so don 't be afraid to team up with the people you love the most , because when it comes to work , it 's always wise to keep your friends close ...
let 's do it .
good call . ... and your enem@@ ies closer .
episode 1 war of empire japan , during the yon@@ gs@@ ama syndrome , went crazy for the kore@@ an entertainment industry . and its effect on the kore@@ an econom@@ y was 1.@@ 196 tr@@ illi@@ on won . ( about us $ 1 bil@@ lion )
the effect on kore@@ an econom@@ y that lee young ae , a top star in 60 coun@@ tries , made is 3 tr@@ illi@@ on won . ( a little less than 3 bil@@ lion dollars ) ms. lee young ae , even if she 's now married with kids , she 's still beautiful , of course . they may imagine " what if ba@@ e y@@ ong jo@@ on , who is still single , was my man "
but the women are not going crazy because of his fine si@@ x-@@ pack . the central reason is hal@@ ly@@ u - because kore@@ an dram@@ as ex@@ ist , he is receiv@@ ing love . as per one book which is written by one exper@@ t of the kore@@ an broadcasting system , even if young people in vietnam don 't know the name of their chief secre@@ tary of the commun@@ ist party , it 's said that there is nothing they don 't know about hal@@ ly@@ u star j@@ ang dong geon .
through hal@@ ly@@ u , the ye@@ arly ex@@ port sur@@ plus on general mer@@ chand@@ ise is 27 tr@@ illi@@ on won .
this inclu@@ des , of course , ex@@ por@@ ted dv@@ ds of our dram@@ as and ost music , the local hand@@ phones which appear in dram@@ as , the cos@@ met@@ ics in dram@@ as , even up to the cars they drive in the dram@@ as .
money . everything is turned into money .
the@@ d@@ duk@@ bo@@ k@@ ki@@ we ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ ye@@ at onth@@ estre@@ et is@@ enjo@@ yed@@ lik@@ e@@ afir@@ strat@@ e@@ itali@@ an@@ past@@ aw@@ hi@@ chis@@ ordered to eat .
at the moment they put the d@@ duk@@ bo@@ k@@ ki , a top star ate in a drama , into their mou@@ ths :
( in japan@@ ese ) it 's del@@ icious !
( in japan@@ ese ) it 's aw@@ esome , isn 't it ?
they have fallen for korea now .
i can 't be in love with you ( french )
look at this !
i 've never seen something like that .
they are in love with our kore@@ an tv dram@@ as .
( in japan@@ ese ) you 're in the way !
even japan , the country which gave the degrad@@ ation of colon@@ iz@@ ation for 36 years .
the country that consider@@ s the land of ko@@ gur@@ yeo as their land - china .
the country of gh@@ eng@@ his khan , who succe@@ eded in win@@ ning the larg@@ est territory in world history - mongol@@ ia .
( in mongol@@ ian ) got it !
dram@@ as of no other country but korea !
they are crazy about our dram@@ as .
cut scene !
did you just sp@@ it on me ?
!
sorry , sorry .
director , i can 't work like this .
to catch just one per@@ cent in the vie@@ wer rat@@ ings ...
just a bit .
our dram@@ as , which the whole world is watching .
money !
anthony kim empire production represent@@ ative
because they turn into money .
m-@@ o-@@ n-@@ e-@@ y .
money .
to make a drama that turns into money we need to use a writ@@ er who makes money .
of course we have to use ac@@ tors who make money . right now , " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge , " produc@@ ed by our empire production company , including its writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o , the money that was paid for the script for the last 7 years in my company ?
the cost for the cast@@ ings is only 86 bil@@ lions , 950 millions and 41 won .
with ro@@ unding it up , it 's 87 bil@@ lion won ( us $ 87 million ) . and out of a total of 29 dram@@ as that were ai@@ red i made 27 a succes@@ s .
i 'm moving within the ac@@ cur@@ ate probabil@@ ity .
and that probabil@@ ity is exactly made by my hand .
everyone , can you tell me what a drama is ?
a drama is a war with numbers .
over there !
represent@@ ative , you said that out of your total 29 dram@@ as , 27 succe@@ eded .
then , what is the reason why the other two dram@@ as failed ?
that means that the dram@@ as you will make in the future can possibly fa@@ il too .
ah , of course , you 're right .
the thing that made those two dram@@ as fa@@ il ... unless , in 2002 , the world cup which made all people in korea go crazy with red devil f@@ ever and mad@@ -@@ co@@ w disease be@@ ef contro@@ vers@@ y of may , in 2008 , happens again !
i 'll absolutely never fa@@ il .
there@@ fore people call the ring i 'm wearing " lord of the rings , "
and they call me the " king of dram@@ as . " everybody , the thir@@ d-@@ class people change the world , and the fir@@ st-@@ class ... enjo@@ ys that world .
represent@@ ative , what is the secret of your succes@@ s ?
represent@@ ative !
you 've already extended the term of the loan for 10 million won ( us $ 10,000 ) four times .
yes .
your address is still the same , right ?
you 're a drama writ@@ er ?
yes .
lee go e@@ un " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge , " a secon@@ dary writ@@ er .
i really like dram@@ as .
what have you written ?
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge .
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge ?
!
wow ! it 's the last day , today !
i 'm a huge fan !
i had no idea such a young person was the writ@@ er of that drama .
i 'm ... just a secon@@ dary writ@@ er .
by secon@@ dary writ@@ er , you run er@@ rand@@ s ... well , i also run er@@ rand@@ s , but the real work i do ... anyway , i think you wrote your job in@@ correc@@ tly .
huh ?
stric@@ tly speaking , you 're not a writ@@ er .
no , but being a secon@@ dary writ@@ er is a tou@@ gh job .
anyway , fix it .
this is wrong , too .
you have to write " jo@@ bl@@ ess . "
excuse me .
excuse me !
a secon@@ dary writ@@ er is also a job . for 365 days per year , sleeping bit by bit , doing all little cho@@ res like cle@@ aning and laun@@ dry , we 're also writing each word to get paid !
there@@ fore , i 'm not jo@@ bl@@ ess !
what ?
i 've paid that dirty expen@@ sive interest without missing even once , and made your bank gain profit !
i got the loan from the bank , not from you , aj@@ umma ! i don 't have much time now , so before pulling out my dirty tem@@ per , process this one . quickly !
except for the last 10 minutes of this final episode , we 've sent all the rest of the tap@@ es to be ed@@ ited .
manag@@ ing director oh jin wan empire production 's # 2 person the shooting team is now standing by at sam@@ che@@ ok , gang@@ won@@ do .
and 10 hours ...
there are only ten hours left until the broad@@ cast !
writ@@ er je@@ ong said she can 't write .
can 't write ?
she said she can 't write about that orange ju@@ ice as pp@@ l ( produc@@ t placement adver@@ tis@@ ement ) , so the script for the last part isn 't done yet .
so , how much per@@ cent ?
par@@ don ?
so how much per@@ cent of the probabil@@ ity to miss the broadcasting time ?
well , i 'm not so good at math ...
i ma@@ jo@@ red in liter@@ ature , so ...
there 's not enough time .
je@@ ong hong jo@@ o eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 's main writ@@ er , a career 20-@@ yr vet@@ eran .
[ mad dog in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong ] yes , writ@@ er je@@ ong , you 're working hard even in this situation that the time is exactly money .
working hard ?
well ..
i 'm writing this , not even eating a proper meal !
that 's why i sent 10 pack@@ s of fresh , excep@@ tional orange ju@@ ice .
haven 't you ta@@ sted it yet ?
represent@@ ative kim ... it 's a clas@@ sy and suit@@ able ju@@ ice for you , a writ@@ er getting paid 20 million won per episode .
this is the scene that our main character will die eleg@@ antly after fin@@ ishing his reven@@ ge .
so does it make sense for him to drink orange ju@@ ice there ?
writ@@ er , you know the hit@@ ter with a legen@@ dary rate , yang jo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ok of the samsung lions .
when there was a ru@@ mor about trad@@ ing him to another team , he said ;
" in my body , blue blood is running ! " ( samsung lions uniform 's color )
this is a sent@@ ence of faith for him to keep his lo@@ yal@@ ty to the team .
writ@@ er je@@ ong , right now , in my body , yellow blood is running . ( without honor@@ ific@@ s )
is it so difficult to make the main character drink orange ju@@ ice ?
what ?
!
did you just talk down to me ?
would i only talk down to you ? i can kick you out too , writ@@ er je@@ ong !
how dare you kick me out ?
hey !
i 'm ...
i 'm je@@ ong hong jo@@ o !
dram@@ as may be art to you for all i know , but to me they are business .
and with that one pack of orange ju@@ ice , 300 million won is on the line . if you 're not going to give up my preci@@ ous 800 million won , which you 've been paid so far for the script , then right now , add orange ju@@ ice into the script !
what if i don 't ?
this isn 't a request .
this is the order from the ow@@ ner who hi@@ red you .
orange ?
orange ju@@ ice my ass !
i 'm back !
you , seriously ... !
go e@@ un , does this make sense ?
huh ?
the main character who is about to have a hero@@ ic death dies after drinking the orange ju@@ ice of pp@@ l ( produc@@ t placement adver@@ tis@@ ement ) ? does it make sense ?
what kind of crazy guy would do this ?
-@@ who else ...
the che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong crazy dog .
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge final episode , the end .
go e@@ un ...
correct any ty@@ pos and send it to them .
yes .
oh , teacher ...
what did you do with that orange ju@@ ice ?
go e@@ un ...
the real artist should not com@@ promise for a dirty sho@@ ppy bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man .
you 've worked really hard , too .
then , i 'm leaving now .
teacher !
even so , what should i say if the production company calls ?
tell him that i 'm gone under the water .
( impl@@ ying " dis@@ connec@@ t all contact lines " )
i 'm leaving .
okay ... go carefully .
oh !
represent@@ ative , the ending has just arrived .
the phone you called is not avail@@ able now ... represent@@ ative , it 's already 1 : 30@@ pm .
why don 't you just tell them to feed that orange ju@@ ice to the ac@@ tors and shoot the final scene ?
where did that orange ju@@ ice come from ?
huh ?
before the main character dies , where did he get it from so that he drin@@ ks it ?
ah , well ... that ...
but , about that ... it was ex@@ posed 7 times , and one of them should be at least 10 seconds . for that , we got 300 million won ( $ 300,000 ) .
from the location to the description , di@@ alogue , entire scene needs to be correc@@ ted .
but ... now we have only 8 and half hours until the on-@@ air time .
if writ@@ er je@@ ong says she can 't write it , what else can we do ?
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
how did it go ?
according to chief moon , the ending tape hasn 't even arrived yet .
please don 't worry , tonight 's show will be ai@@ red without any problem .
at this rate , what if the broadcasting accident ( going blank ) happens ?
cha@@ ir@@ man ...
i am anthony .
that will never happen .
i worried for nothing .
i forgot for a moment that you are anthony .
after the show is finished , i will report back to you .
i 'll talk to you later .
represent@@ ative , what should we do ?
what is the secon@@ dary writ@@ er 's name ?
lee go e@@ un .
represent@@ ative !
that 's right , i 'm anthony kim .
teacher isn 't here .
i already know that .
represent@@ ative ?
actually , a moment ago , writ@@ er je@@ ong had a car accident .
teacher ?
she was on her way back to here , as she promised to correct the script .
but at the inter@@ section right over there , she had a thre@@ e-@@ car re@@ ar-@@ end col@@ l@@ ison .
th ...
then is teacher ... okay ?
don 't worry , i 've checked on her getting rest and falling asleep at er with my own eyes .
which hospital is it ?
before writ@@ er je@@ ong fell asleep , she asked you , miss lee go e@@ un , to correct the script .
me ?
she said that you 're a very compet@@ ent writ@@ er , who is like her other half .
but ... what did she say to correct .... ?
what do you mean , " what " ? of course , it 's about the orange ju@@ ice .
that orange ju@@ ice ... she said i should write that ?
yes , right .
you need to correct that orange ju@@ ice scene .
there is no way that teacher told me to do so .
she also said that you would answer like that .
then , from the location to stage direction and di@@ alogue of the charac@@ ters ...
up to the scene that the character dies after drinking the orange ju@@ ice .
you 're saying she said that i should correct all of them ?
that 's why i came here person@@ ally , not just called , although i 'm so busy now .
really ?
!
do you ... think i 'm telling a lie ?
n-@@ no .
we don 't have much time ...
start writing !
the time ... time 's running out .
writ@@ er je@@ ong said that there is a pretty good one among your practice scrip@@ ts .
ah , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong " ?
that 's right !
the touching story with the background of the japan@@ ese occupation era .
y-@@ yes .
writ@@ er je@@ ong told me to see that right away .
please bring that to the company tomorrow .
if you finish this one well , you can debut with the next show .
i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
let 's go !
debut ...
let 's go .
while we 're going , you should write the scene and send it to the team .
here ...
then ... now ...
that 's right .
we 're going to the film@@ ing location in sam@@ che@@ ok .
let 's go .
think well , how we can make the story that the main character drin@@ ks the orange ju@@ ice and die .
the issue here is where he gets the orange ju@@ ice from .
that 's right .
bu@@ ying the orange ju@@ ice doesn 't make sense , and receiv@@ ing it from someone else is also ... on top of that , you should manage as little change of what we 've already film@@ ed as possible .
then ...
ah !
the construction site !
the last reven@@ ge place for the main character is happening in the construction site , scene # 68 .
action scene in between the orange ju@@ ice box@@ es ...
- orange ju@@ ice bott@@ les rolling and falling down !
- picking up the orange ju@@ ice ?
- so then the ending ...
- drink it .
bang ! -@@ okay , we 'll go with that .
oh , director hong ! leave the camera ra@@ ils as they are , we 've just sent you the correc@@ ted script for scene # 66 and # 67 .
ah , you send the script for scene # 66 and # 67 ?
the main character 's phone scene at the hospital , cut it at the phone bo@@ oth nearby .
the hospital and cut ? yes . move , move , quickly !
orange ju@@ ice box@@ es and the distribution center , i 'm working on it now .
once the shooting is done , move from the beach ..@@ ... and take the road , 5@@ 20@@ m to the north from where you are .
road ?
i told you the distribution center .
there is one deser@@ ted stor@@ age unit .
hurry up to rent that place and set up that place as close to the distribution center as possible and shoot there .
how much time to get there ?
yes , we 'll arrive at 7 : 0@@ 4@@ pm .
we 'll be there in 2 hours and 35 minutes .
check the script in 3 seconds .
manag@@ ing director oh , call the broadcasting station and let them send a helicop@@ ter .
- a helicop@@ ter ?
- yes .
also ar@@ range a quick service motor@@ bike from the shooting site to the helicop@@ ter .
ah , y-@@ y-@@ yes !
scene # 69 is done !
send it first by e-@@ mail and move on to the next scene !
well , hurry up , please !
we don 't have much time .
be careful !
it 's the end !
prepare it quickly !
yes !
hey ! isn 't the smoke too much , huh ?
- the script is here !
- okay , okay ! okay ...
action !
cut !
okay !
let 's move !
everybody !
we 'll move to the next location !
here is the next script .
what ... ?
the final ending ?
we still don 't have it .
then what are we supposed to do ?
!
what time is it ?
yes , it 's ... 5 .. 5 : 27@@ pm .
hey !
move , move , quickly ! go !
go ! hey , move all the equip@@ ment and go !
represent@@ ative , the final ending ... so , how many minutes for its running time in m broadcasting ?
it 's 65 minutes and 20 seconds .
m broadcasting engine@@ er anthony 's plant@@ ed sp@@ y .
just now , director je@@ ong went to the control room with the tape .
alright .
let 's make one more scene .
huh ?
the drama of m broadcasting ( impl@@ ying " mb@@ c " ) has 65 minutes and 20 seconds until the ending , and k broadcasting ( " k@@ bs " ) one is already finished . so , we should make it 1 minutes and 30 seconds longer than m broadcasting 's drama , so that the rat@@ ing can be over 30 % .
isn 't it too f@@ ake ?
yesterday 's rat@@ ing was 24 % , but how can it be over 30 % even if i write one more scene ?
the possibil@@ ity that vie@@ wers will change the channel to another drama after watching their favorite drama is usually 5@@ 2.3 % .
more@@ over , our drama will have it 's final episode today .
the possibil@@ ity that vie@@ wers will watch our drama at the moment of one and half minutes when other dram@@ as are finished ?
8@@ 2.7 % .
but ... after killing off all charac@@ ters , there is only one scene left , where the main character will die alone , so what story can i make more ... ?
so , that 's your job anyway . in this situation when we don 't even have time to shoot the addit@@ ional scene , if we have to add one more scene ?
then ...
should we go with flash@@ back scene ?
that 's correct !
yes , represent@@ ative . among the scenes we 've film@@ ed before , please edi@@ t one flash@@ back scene quickly which possibly comes in mind of the main character , right before he dies .
flash@@ back ?
it will be inser@@ ted right before the ending scene .
running time should be about one and half minute .
yes , i got it !
represent@@ ative , look at this .
" main character , walking with a pack of orange ju@@ ice ... " " drinking orange ju@@ ice , " " orange ju@@ ice "
okay , let 's go with that .
the last script arrived !
move , move !
the rest , get out !
good , good , the last scene . once we 're done with this , it 's done !
from now on , the war is started .
read@@ -@@ y-@@ y-@@ y-@@ y !
action !
the represent@@ ative came .
they are doing the final scene .
cut !
hey !
orange ju@@ ice clo@@ se-@@ up !
let 's shoot the clo@@ se-@@ up of the orange ju@@ ice !
cut !
okay !
the end !
good job .
hurry , hurry , hurry !
good job .
i 've film@@ ed it as you told me to do , but from here to seoul , it takes at least 4 hours .
there are less than 3 hours till the on-@@ air time .
don 't worry , the helicop@@ ter will be used .
excuse me , represent@@ ative . i 've just got a message , but because of the bad weather in seoul , the helicop@@ ter can 't come .
you us@@ eless bastard !
what about the quick@@ -@@ service motor@@ bike ?
well , he 's over there .
pd park , wrap it one more time .
yes .
how much are you ear@@ ning for a month ?
about 2 million won ( $ 2,000 ) .
why ? to s broadcasting station ( " s@@ bs " ) in seoul , not in kang@@ won@@ do , if you arrive there in an hour , i will give you 10 million won ( $ 10,000 ) . if you 're late by 10 minutes , 5 million won , if you 're late by 10 more minutes again , 2 million won , after than , not even a penny .
think you can do it ?
director park , len@@ d me that motor@@ cycle .
huh ?
represent@@ ative ?
ah ... yes .
from here to seoul , 29@@ 3.8 km . ( about 160 miles ) the possibil@@ ity that b@@ iker goes in 300@@ km per hour and arri@@ ves there alive is 36.@@ 2 % .
if he and i , two of us go ... it 's 7@@ 2.4 % .
represent@@ ative kim !
it 's dangerous !
you can die !
anyway , life is 50 : 50 .
i can 't ru@@ in my life because of that half . what i 'm afraid of more than death , it 's fail@@ ure .
what are you doing ?
yes ?
the script is here , here ( in your brain ) , so to edi@@ t the scenes , you should come with me !
what ?
even at this moment while you 're hesit@@ ating , the possibil@@ ity is getting lower , bit by bit .
get on ...
now !
oh , director !
the tape ... has the tape arrived ?
they say it 's on its way .
lee se@@ ong jo ( eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 's present cp ) moon sang il ( s broadcasting station 's drama director ) until the air@@ -@@ time , now there are only 30 minutes left .
kim b@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ok ( s broadcasting station 's deput@@ y drama director ) nam wo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ong ( s broadcasting station 's cp )
what ?
what happened ?
i-@@ is this 911 ?
the place is ... there is an accident at route # 7 , kang@@ re@@ ung jun@@ ction , near the ram@@ p toward ye@@ ong@@ dong highway .
it 's a motor@@ b@@ iker , and the condition is serious .
are you crazy ? if we leave him like that , he will die , he will !
what on earth is a drama to you so that it 's more important than a person 's life ?
so what can i do at this moment ? !
in this field , you should throw away everything else for a drama !
director ... he 's not picking up the phone .
hey !
it has already been 33 minutes since the show has started !
you 're the cp in charge of this show , but are you out of your mind ? hey , this is not a regular episode , but the final episode ! the final one !
have you ever seen a final episode without it 's ending ?
!
well .. that ... s ... even if you have to use a sat@@ elite , find out where he is now ! director !
the tape has arrived .
yeah .
director , they just started the edit@@ ing .
how many minutes are left until the ending ?
yes , 5 minutes and 20 seconds left .
will they be able to edi@@ t within the time ?
they must do even if they all die .
before this scene , the main character ri@@ des a motor@@ bike to go to the distribution center .
they must have film@@ ed it all together at the end .
let 's cut it and pa@@ ste it .
director , the rat@@ ing is contin@@ uo@@ usly rising .
how many more minutes are left ?
yes , 2 minutes and 50 seconds left .
it 's done .
43 .

now , we have only 15 seconds .
hurry , hurry !
director ... the dram@@ as of other broadcasting stations are all done for today .
the time of death ... november 5@@ th , 2010 .
30.@@ 9 % !
director !
we 're the high@@ est one !
hey , you did a good job .
you 've worked hard !
director !
good , good !
you asked me earlier what on earth a drama is .
this is the drama we make .
wow .
they say that people make a con@@ dol@@ ence call when the dog of a prime minister dies , but not when that prime minister actually dies .
what you say now means ... the mother , of the minister of culture and tour@@ ism , is a dog ?
no ...
i didn 't mean that ...
of course not .
all the real dogs are gathered over there .

writ@@ er :
lee go e@@ un .
[ funeral home ] represent@@ ative , no matter how much i think over and over , i think you 'd better not go in there ....
thank you .
by the way ... how do you know my brother .... ?
at the accident site , i was there with him .
then , the person who repor@@ ted to 911 ... ?
and ...
i 'm also the one who re@@ quest@@ ed the last deli@@ very of the dece@@ ased .
the last deli@@ very .... ? the dece@@ ased accepted my request to make a deli@@ very within an hour for the distant taking three hours , and the reason he accepted that impossible request was because i offered to pay 10 million won .
that 's why the accident happened un@@ inten@@ tion@@ ally .
then , you are .... the reason why my husband died ... ?
you bastard !
what 's the reason you came all the way here and say such things ?
after killing my brother , how dare you show up here !
?
please calm down , please !
if it were you , do you think you can calm down now ?
yes , yes , yes .
i thought it 's the right thing for me to tell you the exact situation why the dece@@ ased passed away .
and this .
what 's the use of such money ? my husband is dead now , so what 's the use of it !
? even so , don 't you think you gave them too much ?
it 's from your personal account .
well , i feel sorry for them too , but actually you don 't have any legal respon@@ sibil@@ ity .
and he chose it on his own too .
i don 't think there is any reason for you to do that much ...
some one died while working for my drama .
and i 'm in charge of that drama .
is there any other reason needed ?
ah ... no .
but , are you really alright ?
don 't worry . the drama is finished , and starting tomorrow , for another drama ,
i will become a bad jer@@ k again .
what can i help you with ?
i came for an ap@@ pointment with represent@@ ative kim .
your name is ... ?
i 'm lee go e@@ un , a secon@@ dary writ@@ er for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge . "
he told me to come here once .

c.@@ e.@@ o. anthony kim
hello !
what brought you here ?
yes , you told me before .... oh , you did a good job before .
yes .
i came here because you told me before to bring my practice script .
oh , that 's right .
i 've prepared this one for 3 years .
it 's a histor@@ ical drama with 20 episodes , and i wrote the script and syno@@ p@@ sis up to 4 episodes ...
i got it .
i will contact you after reading them .
yes .
anything else ? yes , by any chance , which hospital is it that teacher je@@ ong is admitted ?
" teacher je@@ ong ... " ?
i mean writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o .
- anthony !
- i told you he 's not in the office now .
oh , she 's here now .
teacher !
so , it was you ? i was wondering which bastard dar@@ ed to touch my script , but it was you !
teacher , what 's wrong with you ?
what 's wrong with me ?
hey ! i brought a country girl from bus@@ an , and taught and raised for 5 years , but now you dare to put your knife on your teacher 's script ?
ah , wait !
wait !
what do you mean " put my knife " ?
i did it because i was told that you asked me to do it !
who , who , who told you that ?
i know , right ?
who told you that ?
you told me so ! you came to the studio person@@ ally , and told me that teacher je@@ ong had a car accident while she had to modi@@ fy the script ! that 's why teacher asked me to modi@@ fy it , so you said that the orange ju@@ ice scene must be inclu@@ ded !
i was atten@@ ding church . you came to me person@@ ally and offered to modi@@ fy the script , and in return , you brought your own script and asked me to read it .
but how come you blame me now ?
what did you say ?
so , your go@@ al was to debut , i see .
no , that 's not true !
no , teacher ! i 'm really w@@ ron@@ ged now !
hey !
here is the obvious evidence , but how can you say it 's mis@@ understanding ?
teacher !
i 'm going to bury you in this drama industry field .
let go of me !
ah , teacher !
no , it wasn 't me ! i 'm saying it wasn 't me !
why on earth are you doing this to me ?
what do you mean ?
" what do you mean ? "
all my efforts with blood and sweat , built for the last 5 years , became nothing at once , but you 're saying " what do you mean ? "
i am sorry .
as promised , i will read your script and if it 's good , i 'll contact you .
do you think i will believe that ?
miss lee go e@@ un .
do you know what is really innocent ?
fo@@ cus@@ ing on the go@@ al .
whether it 's money or succes@@ s , i just focused on it inno@@ cent@@ ly .

all of them ! immediately ! writ@@ er kim , you 've hit the rat@@ ing 50 % three times , but don 't you think the pay@@ ment of 30 million won ( us $ 30,000 ) per episode from " empire " is too little ?
if you come with me , i will give you 40 million won .
writ@@ er park is on the line 2 .
then , please don 't hang up , and think it through for a moment .
secre@@ tary choi , what about writ@@ er lee ( mi hun ) ?
i couldn 't reach her yet .
by all means , put her through .
yes , writ@@ er park , this is anthony .
40 million won ?
writ@@ er kim , anthony is fired now , so he 's calling the number without thinking .
what will you do with the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act with " empire , " then ?
ah , you don 't need to concern about the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act .
i will get the invest@@ ment and handle it right away . you know me well , i 'm anthony .
i admit that anthony is good and res@@ ou@@ ce@@ ful . yes , i admit that .
but , haven 't you heard about writ@@ er je@@ ong ?
" eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge " was mut@@ il@@ ated by anthony .
what do you mean " mut@@ il@@ ated " ?
it had the rat@@ ing 30.@@ 2 % and was placed as the top .
i will treat you as a national writ@@ er , writ@@ er park .
what about 50 million won per episode ?
then , please don 't hang up , and think it through , yes .
secre@@ tary choi , what about writ@@ er lee ?
we didn 't request that side ... hey , excuse me !
ah , yes , yes , i got it .
i will give you more time to think about it .
writ@@ er lee is on the line 1 .
then , please don 't hang up , i will wait for your answer .
you .. you ... you !
what on earth are you ?
i 'm lee go e@@ un who scre@@ wed up in this field because of you !
[ pre@@ view ]
what i 'm mad the most is that such a kind like you is acting up with the power in drama production field .
you will be do@@ omed some day .
i 've always lived a fan@@ cy life .
of course , it 's not like that there was no shadow in my life .
by any chance , do you have about 3 million won ( $ 3,000 ) ?
the problem is that the shadow has been ...
are you in that much difficul@@ ty ?
continued since 3 years ago .
oh , i guess you have something to get some invest@@ ment from japan .
about 10 bil@@ lion won ... ?
- about 10 bil@@ lion won ... ?
- 10 bil@@ lion won ?
lee go e@@ un , lee go e@@ un ... yes , the name was definitely lee go e@@ un ... go e@@ un , don 't you want to make a drama ?
is this writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
be quiet , please !
king of dram@@ as , anthony can stand up again . to conqu@@ er the world again , i need you ,
lee go e@@ un !
episode 2 the@@ fal@@ lo@@ f thel@@ ord y-@@ y-@@ you ! what on earth are you ?
i 'm lee go e@@ un who is scre@@ wed up in the industry because of you ! this is the most crit@@ ical moment in my life . beat it !
because of money ... you scre@@ wed up what 's most important , my life ! what are all of you doing ? get her out of here !
please leave .
i 'll leave here when i 'm ready . what i 'm angry about the most is that my life has dis@@ integr@@ ated because of you , a thir@@ d-@@ rate bottom fe@@ eder .
what i 'm mad the most about is ... that such a person like you is acting up with the power in the drama production field .
you ... will be do@@ omed one day . by someone like you .
yes , writ@@ er lee . it 's me , anthony .
what are you looking at ?
!
if you , writ@@ er lee , is the top of " empire , " that means you 're the top nation@@ ally .
but the fact that the money you 're paid per episode was not the top level has always trou@@ bled me .
i will make you the most .
how about 60 million per episode ?
represent@@ ative kim , i get your meaning .
i 'm driving right now .
let 's talk about it later .
ah , i need to go to a meeting .
instead of just hanging up , can you consider it ?
i 'm beg@@ ging you , writ@@ er lee .
alright , then please give me 15 minutes .
yes , i got it .
let 's do that .
writ@@ er park , have you thought about it ?
i 'm sorry , represent@@ ative kim . no matter how i think about it , i can 't do it because of the bre@@ ach of contr@@ act penal@@ ty .
i told you i 'll take care of it at my end .
hello ?
writ@@ er kim , have you thought about it ? represent@@ ative kim , i appreciate what you said .
let 's do it together next time .
there is no next time for my pro@@ pos@@ al .
also , 40 million won per episode means total 800 million won ! ( $ 8@@ 00,000 ) . rather than getting 800 million won for working like a dog ,
i 'd rather take 600 million won and work like the prime minister .
hello ?
writ@@ er kim ...
shouldn 't you apologi@@ ze first before talking about nothing but money first ?
hey , represent@@ ative kim , because of you , i 've been rec@@ ently living by taking sleeping pil@@ ls .
how can you do that ?
since when did you respect me ?
i 'm hanging up .
represent@@ ative kim , haven 't you been ax@@ ed ?
ax@@ ed ?
i left on my own two feet .
hello ?
h@@ el ...
that !
[ name # 15 ] je@@ ong hong jo@@ o
[ name # 1 ] lee mi he@@ on
it has to be lee mi he@@ on .
only lee mi he@@ on .
writ@@ er lee , it 's me , anthony .
writ@@ er lee ?
what should i do , represent@@ ative kim ?
je@@ ong ...
writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o ?
that 's right .
it 's je@@ ong hong jo@@ o .
were you expecting writ@@ er lee min he@@ on ?
right now , she is beside me .
writ@@ er je@@ ong , right now , i 'll apologi@@ ze to you .
i 'm really , really sorry .
actually , i tried to immediately phone ...
you need@@ n 't apologi@@ ze .
you already know .
everybody wished to see you crash and burn .
anthony , you 're completely washed up .
um@@ m ...
represent@@ ative ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man said you should vac@@ ate the office right now .
3 years later ...
the represent@@ ative has arrived !
you are here ?
i 've always lived a brilli@@ ant life .
in the brilli@@ ant life , there can be both the light and shadow .
of course , it doesn 't mean in my life , there are no shadows .
the problem here is that shadow has been contin@@ uo@@ usly with me since three years ago until now .
however , i never felt un@@ happy . despite being ax@@ ed from the company , despite the company 's ban@@ krup@@ t@@ cy for which i would have to shell out 30 bil@@ lion won to start an@@ ew ; i was fine .
because i 'm not a kind of person who is ob@@ ses@@ sive about the past .
and i dre@@ amed my come@@ back again .
however , in the industry , i notice everyone quietly avo@@ ids me .
after that , even the invest@@ ments have been blo@@ cked and work has not gone well . even when i had no office , even moving again like that , even to the ex@@ tent of s@@ elling my home , it was not bad .
but ...
even if my mother were to die , i am not a person who cri@@ es .
i don 't want to cry . i can@@ not fa@@ thom why thro@@ ugh@@ out the past three years , without a regular fixed pat@@ tern , it 's like this .
i don 't think it is the case that there is no pat@@ tern .
whenever you feel anxi@@ ous , you 're touching your finger .
three years ago , what is the story associ@@ ated with that ?
although you are brus@@ hing it off with those words , it 's not so within your mind .
please , give me medicine . because we 've stopped your medi@@ cation , we could find that ( pat@@ tern ) out .
but because i 've stopped the medi@@ cation , i 'm crying again , aren 't i ?
i don 't have any more medi@@ cation . please give me some more .
re@@ lying on medi@@ cation can@@ not cure the disease .
you want to find out what causes mental inst@@ ability fundament@@ ally ...
so what is the per@@ cent@@ age ?
what ?
!
i 'm asking what is the per@@ cent@@ age of probabil@@ ity that i wouldn 't cry without the medicine .
the probabil@@ ity that i wouldn 't cry by taking the medi@@ cation is 100 % .
please give me medicine .
psychi@@ at@@ ry
welcome .
i will write a pres@@ cription for you .
but promise me , you will accept reality and over@@ come it .
that will be 50,000 won . ( appro@@ x . $ 50 )
it was dec@@ lined .
you 've arrived ?
yeah . nothing really happened , right ?
there is something that happened .
the land@@ ow@@ ner said if we didn 't pay rent by the end of this month , she 'll kick us out . next . if we don 't pay the gas bill on time , they 're going to cut the gas .
i really hate to tell you this , but ... it 's been months since i 've last been paid .
i couldn 't pay my credit card bill , so i 'm getting the push call from the card company .
i hope you will pay me by this month .
where are you going ?
i might be late so go home first .
yes .
please leave well .

oh , please ... you women ...

oh , seriously !
i was watching it too .

please just have this del@@ icious gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el , and con@@ cede the channel to them .
oh , the moment is gone !
i wonder what happened .
the fact that he was their son must have been reve@@ aled .
how do you know that ?
look at his expression .
it 's the hospital and she is shocked from looking at the test resul@@ ts .
probably , the doctor would say , " as per the test , it 's 99 % mat@@ ched . "
as per the test , it 's 99 % mat@@ ched .
then , at this moment , the mom would cry out the name of the son ..@@ ...
ji wan !
that 's right , the son 's name is ji wan , ji wan .
you 're aw@@ esome .
how ?
how come you figure even the di@@ alogue ?
i know right .
you could become a writ@@ er .
you could really become a writ@@ er .
that 's right , she 's much better than the actual writ@@ er !
- that 's right !
- why are you serv@@ ing the gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el here ?
ge@@ ez . i think we must send her to the broadcasting station .
why do you have so much to say if you came to eat some gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el ?
have you read that article ?
i have . it was really epic .
move the camera up@@ wards and bam !
and camera # 2 is coming in ... director hong , long time , no see .
have you been well ?
ah ... hello .
are you here to see represent@@ ative oh ?
i heard your contr@@ act with " empire " is almost up .

i 'm sorry about the wait .
what are you doing that 's making you that busy ?
we were looking for some writ@@ ers .
there are count@@ less writ@@ ers , but what have you done for the last 3 years , not making connection with them ? well then sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , what br@@ ings you here without notice ?
yeah .
do you have about $ 3,000 on you ?
are you having that much of a difficult time ?
huh ?
do you not have even $ 3,000 ?
no .
while i was coming here , i just hit another car slightly .
but the other person wanted to sett@@ le it in cash .
i was planning on giving him about $ 3,000 but i forgot my wal@@ let at my company .
he must be waiting right now so just len@@ d me the money since it 's not that big of an amount .
ah !
what should i do ?
i too , forgot my wal@@ let .
why don 't you just call your insur@@ ance company ?
otherwise , you can get in trouble later .
of course .
there must be some invest@@ ors from japan right ?
huh ?
i saw that a minute ago while i was waiting .
i 'm having such a hard time because of this .
why ?
are they str@@ ict ?
they say this kore@@ an-@@ japan@@ ese is a pretty succes@@ s@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man in japan , but he says that he wants to inv@@ est about 10 bil@@ lion won ( $ 10 million ) to a kore@@ an drama .
10 bil@@ lion won ?
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ...
this is 10 bil@@ lion won project .
since we 're a big company , a pro@@ pos@@ al in such scale comes .
who would want to deal with a tiny company for this project ?
whatever .
if you are interested , you might as well try out for it .
the condition is simple .
the background of the drama should be japan@@ ese occupation era .
japan@@ ese occupation era ?
yes .
he 's saying that the drama should de@@ pic@@ t the fier@@ ce life story of a man , who 's bet@@ ting his destiny in the swir@@ ling sad history of the japan@@ ese occupation era .
but how could we find a script like that all of a sudden ?
i 'm chec@@ king with the writ@@ er 's group and also searching famous writ@@ ers too , but all they wrote were not really satisfac@@ tory , so ...
ah , ais@@ h . represent@@ ative ?
oh !
are you okay ?
represent@@ ative kim !
are you okay ?
japan@@ ese occupation era , in the whe@@ els of sad history , ...
it 's fine .

just a minute .
everyone , be quiet for a minute !
yes , you were saying ?
do you happen to be bound by a contr@@ act or production company ?
no , thats not a problem .

my " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
yes , if it 's ok with you , i would like to meet with you today .
today ?
where do i need to go to ?
no , i will come to you .
um@@ m ... miss lee go e@@ un , it 's been a while .
have you been well since the last time i saw you ?
get out right now .
miss lee go e@@ un .
i said to get out .
writ@@ er lee ...
i told you to get lost , you jer@@ k !
will you not let go ?
i know that i made a mistake back then .
" writ@@ er lee " ?
after k@@ icking me out of the field of drama writing , you 've got some ner@@ ves to call me " writ@@ er lee . "
because of you , i 've been called a sell@@ -@@ out who back@@ stab@@ bed her men@@ tor and other har@@ sh names .
because of you , my future as a writ@@ er was ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly crus@@ hed and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy@@ ed .
three years have passed , and you just show up and want to produce my drama ?
i 'm sorry . i sin@@ cer@@ ely am .
that 's why i 've come here to apologi@@ ze .
three years ago , you seemed to think that my work was a wor@@ th@@ less piece of crap .
what happened ?
do you suddenly like it ?
because it 's sin@@ cere .
who are you trying to fool ?
just tell me the truth .
yes , your script is cr@@ app@@ y and medi@@ oc@@ re at best , but it has some potential .
i 'm after that potential .
i told you not to talk rub@@ bis@@ h , just tell me the truth !
i got a rich ge@@ ez@@ er hook@@ ed on your script .
you ...
you ... are really low .
get lost .
before getting lost , i 'll just say one thing .
i don 't know if you 've heard , but i 'm completely broke .
all i have is an over@@ drawn bank account and that cr@@ app@@ y old car over there . i 'm behind on my rent pay@@ ment , too .
however ...
i can rise again .
the king of dram@@ as anthony can rise again .
to conqu@@ er the world again , i ... need you , lee go e@@ un .
i ...
don 't need you .
so get out .
didn 't you hear what my kid said ?
i guess making the daughter of me , park k@@ ang ja , miser@@ able three years ago wasn 't enough for you .
if you don 't want to die by my hand get out right now .
i 'll say one more final word .
i told you to get out right now ...
hey ... that guy said he would say just one more thing and then go .
let 's hear what he 's got to say !
yes , let 's hear him out .
fine , i 'm a col@@ d@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , re@@ pul@@ sive jer@@ k . but what does that have to do with you ?
what does me being a jer@@ k have to do with you giving up your dream instead of pur@@ su@@ ing it ?
so you want to spend the rest of your life here serv@@ ing mac@@ ker@@ el ?
just be content with telling your child one day , " your mother also used to have a dream once . "
dreams aren 't there to be remin@@ is@@ ced , but rather , to be ful@@ filled .
and the only chance to ful@@ fill this dream will be gone after tonight .
okay .
it 's okay if you hate me .
but don 't do something you 'll be sorry for , for the rest of your life .
what are you looking at ?
just stuff your faces with mac@@ ker@@ els !
good night .

two more gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els .
do you plan on living your entire life gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els like this ?
and then are you going to tell your children that you had a dream at one point of your life ?
dreams aren 't something to look back on when you grow older .
dreams are there to be pur@@ su@@ ed .
it 's fine if you hate me .
but just don 't do something you will regret for the rest of your life .

that 's fine .
you must pur@@ sue your dream .
don 't worry about mom .
go .
any@@ ways , you ...
had no s@@ kill at gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els .
this is for the best .

i really hate people like you .

why don 't you have a contr@@ act fee ?
it 's written right there .
that i will give you the money after i rece@@ ive the invest@@ ment fee .
you know my situation well enough .
then why did you get on the plane ?
because i 'm a vil@@ lager from bus@@ an who has never rid@@ den a plane before .
why ?
what is that for ?
it 's your contr@@ act fee .
there 's nothing more i can do even if you glar@@ e at me .

huh ?

turn off the lights .
it 's already 8 o '@@ clock .
wake up now .
what kind of writ@@ er sle@@ eps so much ?
being a girl , you grin@@ d your teeth and snor@@ e .
good morning .
the president is waiting .
he 's prepared a y@@ acht and a car .
what kind of a person is cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe that he wants to fully fund the drama production ?
i told you .
he 's a kore@@ an-@@ japan@@ ese business man lo@@ aded with money .
so you 're saying he looked at my script and liked it ?
you wish .
you wouldn 't even be here if i hadn 't fu@@ d@@ ged the fac@@ ts .
what do you mean ? all you 've got is 5 years of experience as an assistant writ@@ er , with no publications , not even a debut experience , not to mention the fact that you were ex@@ communic@@ ated from the field and wast@@ ed 3 years away .
then ...
what did you tell him ?
i told him to meet you in person .
ne qu@@ id nim@@ is ( nothing in exces@@ s ) .
too much fu@@ d@@ ging can back@@ fire .
the only reason he 's invest@@ ing on this project is his trust in me , so don 't make any mist@@ akes and do well ! so don 't make any mist@@ akes and do well !
fine .
he 's a man after all ,
the president has arrived .
this person is the writ@@ er ?
yes , she is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
reading your work brought back long-@@ forgotten memories of my hom@@ eland and my days of youth .
as he read your work , he wondered whether this in@@ experienced ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er would be worth his invest@@ ment .
the whole time i was reading your script , i was so moved by it , that i just had to see the writ@@ er in person .
the whole time he was reading , he saw p@@ lot hol@@ es here and there , but because he trust@@ s produc@@ er anthony he has decided to inv@@ est in our drama .
did you conce@@ ive the idea for the script yourself ?
he asked whether the story was your own idea .
answer him .
though i didn 't experience this pain@@ ful era of our history myself , because she didn 't experience this pain@@ ful era of our history herself ,
i wanted to write about the life of a man whose destiny was ent@@ win@@ ed around that trag@@ ic period .
she had a writ@@ er 's block , but it was fate that led her to a cru@@ cial men@@ tor , which would be me , and i gave her some ad@@ vice and that 's how she was able to finish writing her script .
ah , so anthony kim is the writ@@ er 's sa@@ vi@@ our .
then , i will trust you anthony kim and your writ@@ er .
i will sign a contr@@ act with you .
what did he say ? that based on his trust on the produc@@ er , anthony , he will sign a contr@@ act with us !
really ?
oh , thank you !
( in japan@@ ese ) thank you .
i have one condition though .
thi ... this year ?

for this year , the drama broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been decided , so ... is that it needs to come out within this year . for this year , the drama broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been decided , so ...

i 'm finally making a come@@ back .
my empire is all starting again !
i 'll show you what i can do , mom .
i 'll definitely show you hat i can become a drama writ@@ er you need not be as@@ ham@@ ed of . i said that i wouldn 't write dram@@ as again , but this destin@@ y-@@ like opportunity ...
i can 't miss it !
the opportunity is already in my hand .
this is my destiny !
born to be the king of dram@@ as , my destiny ! to the people who have mis@@ understood me until this day to the bastar@@ ds that have looked down on me my ear@@ nest sin@@ cer@@ ity with a bloody , migh@@ ty rule ,
i 'll show them ! i 'll get my reven@@ ge !
( in japan@@ ese ) how are you ?
( in japan@@ ese ) i am fine .
aig@@ oo .
who 's there ?
is someone there ?
( in japan@@ ese ) stop !
( in japan@@ ese ) please ... spar@@ e me ..
( in japan@@ ese ) i won 't do it again ... ever !
the person who break@@ s his promise dies .
just what in the world are you doing ?
it is human nature to break a promise .
but the person who break@@ s his promise to me definitely dies .
who 's there ?
thank you for watching king of dram@@ as with us .
please follow our channel .
have to air it within this year .. !
there 's no question that the big@@ gest productions get sched@@ ul@@ ed first .
people only know k@@ ang hy@@ un min as a big star , but he 's in fact the big@@ gest idiot there is . mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
get up and put your hands up if you don 't want to die .
did you fall for anthony 's decep@@ tions again ?
why don 't you sign a contr@@ act with us ?
we 'll make the best offer ever made to a ro@@ o@@ kie .
do whatever it takes . get her !
episode 3 the return of the king but the person who break@@ s their promise to me definitely dies . who 's there ?
it 's me , ak@@ iko . it 's late , are you not going to sleep ... ? since you weren 't beside me , i couldn 't sleep .
let 's go home . please don 't make any noise . y-@@ you speak kore@@ an ...
i 'm a kore@@ an drama fan . of course , i know some kore@@ an .
could you have possibly heard earlier ... ?
oh , your trans@@ lation with lies ?
don 't worry .
i didn 't say a word to my husband .
were you that surprised ?
my husband doesn 't kill people often , though .
then ... cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe ...
he 's the best yak@@ uza ( gang@@ ster ) in ky@@ us@@ hu area .
wat@@ an@@ abe finance with 40 years of history , he 's the boss of that yak@@ uza .
my husband is a bit har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged and col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , but you don 't know how gentle and tender he is usually .
then ...
then the cha@@ ir@@ man of the wat@@ an@@ abe group is ... of course , it 's a " group . "
you can 't even guess how many " team lead@@ ers " he has .
as long as you keep the promise that you would show us the drama within this year , you won 't die , so don 't worry .
and you asked earlier why the drama must be on tv within this year .
this ... is a secret .
in fact , my husband has the last stage of stomach cancer .
so you must definitely keep your promise !
okay , i know what you 're thinking , but ...
low@@ -@@ grade ...
what do i do ?
should i tell him that i can 't do it now ?
no , how hard it was to get this opportunity ! if i lose this chance , i might not have any chance to come back , not only even in three years but forever !
but life is more important !
i can 't be killed by a yak@@ uza with last@@ -@@ stage stomach cancer !
wouldn 't it be better to tell him that i can 't do this , before it be@@ comes too late ?
what ?
you 've come here and now you say you can 't do it ?
if someone goes back on their word with me they die . whether being killed by a yak@@ uza 's boss , or dying later after fa@@ iling to come back forever , anyway it 's all the same .
i have only one life , so who car@@ es even if i use his money ?
the dice of destiny is already cast anyway .
represent@@ ative !
the japan@@ ese wat@@ an@@ abe group are on the line holding .
good afternoon , mr. tan@@ aka .
i 'm empire productions represent@@ ative oh jin wan .
how are you doing ? about that invest@@ ment you told me about earlier , is it okay to send a script over now ?
yes ?
i 'm sorry .
we have decided to sign with the world production agency .
world production ?
anthony , that jer@@ k !
it 's not like somebody is chas@@ ing us . please , let 's go together .
to put the drama on tv within this year , we have no time to lose , not a second .
within this year ?
yes , broadcasting the drama within this year is the condition of his invest@@ ment .
there are just a few months left this year , how can we get a broadcasting time s@@ lot ?
i can do that , so you 'd better focus on your script now .
the real war is just started from now on .
represent@@ ative , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
the de@@ pos@@ it is wi@@ red to our account .
as if it 's so new to us ..
why aren 't you coming in ?
oh , it 's writ@@ er lee .
you 've seen him before , right ? he 's jo@@ o dong se@@ ok , the produc@@ er .
you 're having lunch .
well , i 'm done now . come over , take a seat .
by the way , where is my desk ?
oh , it 's over there .
here , miss writ@@ er .
okay .
then , where is the room that i 'll be sleeping in ?
it 's over there . show her inside .
huh ?
yes .
over here .
over here , miss writ@@ er .
i 'm done .
represent@@ ative ?
shouldn 't you give me a minimum space so that i can work on my writing ?
what 's wrong ?
you 're not fat , but is that space too small ?
no , i mean , it 's not small , but it 's too l@@ acking ...
it 's too l@@ acking , i agree .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
i rushed to come here , so i couldn 't bring anything .
i heard you got the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe group in japan .
that 's really just amazing !
we were lucky .
and your help was great too , represent@@ ative oh .
what do you mean " lucky " ?
it was sol@@ ely because of your compet@@ ence .
oh , it 's writ@@ er lee .
it 's been a@@ while .
how have you been ?
i thought you two were having a bad connection , but i guess i was wrong .
like me , i thought writ@@ er lee also wished sun@@ ba@@ e 's business to be ru@@ ined , but i was wrong about that too .
like me ?
yes .
three years ago , when the quick@@ -@@ service b@@ iker died .
how could all the details of that accident be on the media mal@@ ic@@ iously ?
why ?
why were all those articles pour@@ ing out without giving us any chance to block them ?
haven 't you doub@@ ted that ?
perhaps ...
you ?
yes .
that ti@@ p-@@ off was done by me .
i mean ... why , you ?
why ?
you don 't know ? for 7 years , under you , i had done all kin@@ ds of work , but although i 'd cle@@ aned up all crap you made , you took all the credit .
did you think i would live forever as the second man of " empire , " the subor@@ din@@ ate of anthony ?
how could you ?
how could ... ?
how dare you ?
!
" how dare ... you ? "
i should be saying that to you .
the represent@@ ative of " empire " now is ...
me .
such a person like you who uses che@@ ap tr@@ icks to make just one drama . a loser like you who hit rock bottom can 't dare to con@@ front me , the most powerful man in drama production industry , the king of the empire is me !
drop that us@@ eless hope , please .
with the invest@@ ment contr@@ act which will become inv@@ ali@@ d if the show can 't be ai@@ red within this year , you can 't fight against me .
there@@ fore , please just stay broken quietly . if you still want to get that tiny bit of respect as sun@@ ba@@ e .
what are you watching so int@@ ently ?
what did i do ?
i 'm just cle@@ aning .
miss writ@@ er lee .
let 's talk for a little bit .
i have something to show you .
this is the writ@@ er 's room prepared by empire production for you , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
earlier , i was a bit too en@@ rag@@ ed , so i said ru@@ de things .
please understand .
why don 't you sign a contr@@ act with us , empire production ?
i signed a contr@@ act with world production 's anthony kim .
how much did you rece@@ ive for that contr@@ act ?
well , the contr@@ act ...
it doesn 't matter .
i don 't think anthony gave you a proper pay@@ ment for the contr@@ act because he came to me to bor@@ row $ 3,000 a few days ago .
and even if you received some , we will pay the penal@@ ty for bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act for you and give you the best condition you can get as a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er . ten million won ( $ 10,000 ) per episode , the advan@@ ce pay@@ ment 100 million won for contr@@ act , and the rest of the pay@@ ment 100 million won , so total 200 million won ( $ 200,000 ) .
are you being like this to me in order to get your reven@@ ge on him ?
if you thought of me as such a small ( pet@@ ty ) person , then i 'm a bit disap@@ pointed .
oh , i heard that the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe of japan was done sol@@ ely because of your script , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
by any chance , were you dece@@ iv@@ ed by anthony , again ?
writ@@ er lee , even if you 're working with anthony , your script won 't be able to be ai@@ red .
as soon as you sign a contr@@ act with us ... well , was it " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
that script will be proce@@ eded right away and be ai@@ red , i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
but ....
this is the key for this apartment .
while staying here , please take your time to consider this offer .
tomorrow afternoon , i will come to see you with the contr@@ act .
don 't forget .
that anthony will never be able to make this drama .
did writ@@ er lee not say where she was going ?
well , when i was back from the rest room , she was already gone .
what about her phone ?
no matter how many times i try , she doesn 't answer her phone . but you know , director . since we got the advan@@ ce de@@ pos@@ it , can 't we have some del@@ icious food ?
our destiny depen@@ ds on how to use that money .
what about the new re@@ cru@@ its ?
they will come to work here by 3 pm .
are you not eating ?
you can eat the rest .
i heard that the invest@@ ment from wat@@ an@@ abe of japan was done sol@@ ely because of your script , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
by any chance , were you dece@@ iv@@ ed by anthony , again ?
i will give you the best condition you can get as a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
10 million won ( $ 10,000 ) per episode , the advan@@ ce pay@@ ment 100 million won for contr@@ act , and the rest of the pay@@ ment 100 million won , so in total 200 million won ( $ 200,000 ) .
as soon as you sign a contr@@ act with us , that script will be proce@@ eded right away and be ai@@ red , i gu@@ aran@@ tee you .
don 't forget . anthony will definitely not be able to make this drama .
mom ?
our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , are you writing the script well ?
by the way , mom , would it be important to keep the promise with a person i can 't trust ?
or would it be more important to choose the gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed future , not keeping that promise ?
is something going on ?
oh no . i 'm just saying .
this child ...
why are you thinking hard about such an easy thing ?
what 's so important about the promise with a person you can 't trust ? the future with the gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed succes@@ s is more important , of course .
i guess so , right ?
of course !
aun@@ tie ! please give the food quickly !
i 'm busy right now so i will call you later okay ?
alright .
this person is un@@ avail@@ able right now .
the signal is on , but she 's not picking up the phone .
anyway , i sent a text message that we will have a meeting at 3@@ pm today , so she will come by then .
director ?
we 're ready to have the meeting .
writ@@ er lee ?
miss writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
thank you for giving me such a good opportunity , but i wish my drama would be made to give hope to everyone , not to step on someone .
i can 't take this opportunity by breaking a promise .
i 'm sorry .
my first script , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be made by world production as promised .
we couldn 't even contact you . what in the world happened ?
i 'm late only by 3 minutes .
what ?
are you saying you ignored the calls on purpose ?
well , my friend told me to stay at her apartment if i don 't have any place to stay , so i went there ... you went there , and ... ? it looked great outside , but even the cell phone didn 't work there , and it was too lux@@ ur@@ ious for me to stay there .
the place where people live should be more hum@@ ane , don 't you think so ?
as promised , i sent the contr@@ act pay@@ ment to your account , so check it later .
hurry up and go in . everyone is waiting for you .
what do we do ?
what do we do ?
call writ@@ er je@@ ong .
what ?
" eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " will be ai@@ red this year .
for that , park shin yang ( a famous kore@@ an actor ) is going to take the main role next year ...
we can do the casting again .
director .
don 't you understand what i 'm saying ?
call a meeting immediately .
yes , sir .
this is han k@@ ang wo@@ ok , who new@@ ly joined world production as a produc@@ er .
yes , nice to meet you . yes .
he 's good at the produc@@ er work but not good at family matters , so he divor@@ ced two years ago .
and here is team leader park se@@ ok hy@@ un for finance .
i 'm still single , no need to worry about being divor@@ ced .
he 's single , no chance to get married , so don 't care about him .
and here is go@@ o yi j@@ ae , the young@@ est staff for er@@ rand@@ s .
please take care of me !
i 'm go@@ o yi j@@ ae of production team .
and this is ...
yes !
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
please take care of me !
so now we 've done our introduc@@ tions . everyone here who will share the destiny with our world production , as you can see , the level of our office is on the ground .
but ... remember this ...
the bank account with 67@@ 0,000 won ( $ 670 ) and this small , hum@@ ble office are the ground we will new@@ ly start , but with the advan@@ ce de@@ pos@@ it 100 million won , up there , we 'll head to the top . to do that , what you will do from now on is to win the broadcasting sched@@ ule so that this drama can be ai@@ red within this year .
ai@@ red within this year ?
air@@ ing it within this year is the condition for the invest@@ ment .
the rest of the invest@@ ment fund of 9.@@ 9 bil@@ lion won , a total of 10 bil@@ lion won ( $ 10 million ) worth drama , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
definitely needs to be ai@@ red within this year .
what will happen if it can 't be ai@@ red within this year ?
we die . cur@@ r@@ ently for mon@@ day and tu@@ es@@ day of the k broadcasting station ( impl@@ ying k@@ bs ) , " days of passion " is being ai@@ red now , and after this , a histor@@ ic drama with 50 episodes is planned . for wed@@ nes@@ day and thur@@ s@@ day , " heaven " with 20 episodes , and after this , the drama of director je@@ ong se@@ ong chan is planned , so this year 's broadcasting sched@@ ule has already been complet@@ ed .
what about m broadcasting ( impl@@ ying mb@@ c ) ? m broadcasting has already complet@@ ed it 's broadcasting sched@@ ule for this year , and the place which has the time room for this year is only november for mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day of s broadcasting ( impl@@ ying s@@ bs ) .
" top secrets ... "
wasn 't it casting the actor choi ta@@ e jo@@ on ?
this early morning , ta@@ e jo@@ on had a big accident during the first shooting , so he needs to rest for 8 week .
if he needs 8 weeks , the shooting will be cancel@@ ed soon .
yes . the media is talking about his " dis@@ playing the fighting spirit for the drama " in real time , but we should consider that his drama is actually going to be cancel@@ ed .
then , are you saying they 're rele@@ asing the fal@@ se information to the media ?
for the production company , they 've already lost hund@@ reds of million won , so we can say they are making a fran@@ tic last@@ -@@ dit@@ ch effort . for the actor , since he can 't keep acting for the drama , he 's just trying to main@@ tain his image , that 's all .
then the remained spot is only november for s broadcasting ...
fine .
make a list of ac@@ tors in their 30 's who can play for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ai@@ red in november .
let 's go with november , s broadcasting .
represent@@ ative !
even so , broadcasting it in november is ...
november in this year at s broadcasting .
this is the matter of life or death of our empire production .
no matter what it takes , we must get that time s@@ lot ! since the top ac@@ tors in our company are not avail@@ able anyway , make a list for top ac@@ tors of other compan@@ ies and call the meeting again .
the meeting is starting again .
tell them i 'll be there soon .
why did you come back again ?
huh ?
why did you come back again , not going to oh jin wan ?
how did you know ... ? you make a lot of fus@@ s for even a small matter , but you were out of reach after going out to dum@@ p gar@@ b@@ age , and came back one day later .
more@@ over , right after oh jin wan vis@@ ited .
and then saying all the non@@ sense about a friend and the lux@@ ur@@ ious apartment or what@@ not .
did you think i would fall for your lam@@ e acting ?
i guess the lux@@ ur@@ ious apartment part must be true . oh jin wan , not your friend , showed it to you , though .
why ?
why did you come back to me ?
is the reason really that important ?
it 's not that important , but i 'm very curious .
people like you wouldn 't understand , but there are princip@@ les and prom@@ ises to some people .
and there are some people who live to keep those things even if they don 't have much .
i just kept them , that 's all .
how grateful i am .
it 's not for your sake .
of course it 's for mine .
so it wasn 't anything special .
and i 've told you before .
it 's not " you . " it 's " represent@@ ative . "
s
k
k
m since you came from the movie industry , if i make an ex@@ ample in that side , if you made a movie , you need to release it through movie theat@@ ers .
yes .
but in our field , there are only three theat@@ ers .
so-@@ called " 3 compan@@ ies of ground-@@ wave . "
if you can 't get the time s@@ lot through these three , the drama production itself is impossible , far from rele@@ asing part .
then , the competition to get the time s@@ lot must be really fier@@ ce .
that 's right .
but the golden time for a drama is 10@@ pm !
the number of the drama production compan@@ ies which are desperately trying to get that time s@@ lot is 248 , coun@@ ting only kore@@ an compan@@ ies . even if we count only three writ@@ ers per each company , 248 by 3 .. 3 by 8 is 24 , and .... 248 by 3 .. 3 by 8 is 24 , and ....
it 's 7@@ 44 : 1 .
so , if we think about it 's probabil@@ ity ....
don 't you have the calcul@@ ator ?
0.@@ 134 % .
it 's just 0.1 % , no need to round it up .
you will see with your own eyes from now on how hard it is to get the time s@@ lot .
let 's start the casting .
yes , sir . yes , sir .
exclu@@ ding the ac@@ tors who bel@@ ong to our empire production , these are the ac@@ tors who can play for the drama which will be ai@@ red in november .
lee je@@ ong shi@@ k and oh ta@@ e ye@@ on , do you think they can be the top ( main role ) ?
exclu@@ de them .
re@@ move je@@ ong do jin too . he can be the top for a daily so@@ ap opera , but he doesn 't have the mask for a mini-@@ series .
about cha se@@ ung hy@@ un ....
isn 't he going to film a movie in dec@@ ember ?
cha se@@ ung hy@@ un can 't work with us because of the movie .
who do you think would be okay for the main role , writ@@ er lee ?
while writing the script , haven 't you considered any among these guys ?
how about yo@@ o ha ye@@ on ?
i think he 's the most similar one to the main role 's image .
he 's not good because he 's a jun@@ kie .
i heard he quit last year .
the most un@@ reli@@ able words in the world is that a jun@@ kie says he quit the drug and the gam@@ e-@@ ad@@ dic@@ t says he quit gamb@@ ling .
even so , he 's one of the top three in korea . that 's true , but although the new@@ sp@@ aper didn 't report it yet , the pro@@ secu@@ tor 's office already finished it 's intern@@ al investig@@ ation , so there is a ru@@ mor they would blow it right before the presidenti@@ al election .
tell him to blow the lunch box bom@@ b by himself .
how about se@@ o ta@@ e ha , director ?
but would he want to play the role for a " reven@@ ge " drama again ?
he has a sever@@ e depression issue , so as far as i know , he has been getting therap@@ y for months .
what a mor@@ on ...
acting must be done by acting ...
next actor .
is depression a sin ?
well ... i didn 't mean that , but ...
then should we go with se@@ o ta@@ e ha ?
ah , forget it .
who else is left ?
kim jin ho and k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
kim jin wo@@ o has a lot of female fans .
he 's very hot now , not only in korea but also in other coun@@ tries .
not only s broadcasting , but also all three stations can 't res@@ ist him .
let 's go with kim jin wo@@ o , represent@@ ative .
not him .
now what ?
if i say no , then no .
well do you have a reason to say no ?
you don 't need to know .
why are you leaving kim jin wo@@ o out and going with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why on earth are you saying we need to go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ? " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 , " november at s broadcasting , let 's go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min for its male main .
prepare for that .
yes .
excuse me , director heo ..
it has been only for a short while since you were s@@ cou@@ ted to our empire after staying in the u.s. for years .
so i guess you don 't know well , so that 's why i 'm telling you this .
kim jin wo@@ o really hat@@ es anthony .
why ?
back in the day , anthony st@@ ole kim jin wo@@ o 's woman .
so what ?
what does that have to do with us ?
of course it has something to do , with our represent@@ ative . among top ac@@ tors , kim jin wo@@ o and k@@ ang hy@@ un min who can be used for november , the one anthony can sel@@ ect is only k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
this fight can be defin@@ ed as the total war between anthony , who will put his life on the line to have k@@ ang hy@@ un min for the casting , and our represent@@ ative oh .
cur@@ r@@ ently , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is considering " getting married to my man , " and ...
by the writ@@ er g@@ ong ji young ?
represent@@ ative , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is doing a fan meeting at the diamond hall of ace hotel .
it ends at 5 o '@@ clock .
prepare a clean copy of the script . i 'm taking off .
yes .
what are you doing ?
i 'm making myself en@@ grave him in my mind . that way he can be alive in the script .
so have you en@@ grav@@ ed him well ?
the more i think about it , the more i like it .
he looks intellig@@ ent , with an air of melan@@ chol@@ y about him .
once you see him in person , you 'll find out in less than a minute how intellig@@ ent and melan@@ chol@@ ic he is .
what ...
you raise me up , so i can stand on mountains .
you raise me up to walk on stor@@ my se@@ as .
i am strong when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up to more than i can be

long time no see !
yes , hello .
you should be holding fan@@ me@@ et@@ ings in japan and china besides this crow@@ ded seoul .
so i should .
i have a good drama in the mak@@ ings , you should work with me .

i got an invest@@ ment of 10 bil@@ lion won from japan .
good for you .
i 'll get the november broadcasting s@@ lot at s broadcasting .
i did hear that ta@@ e jo@@ on has been seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
i guess he couldn 't get up this time .
i 'll cut to the chase . this is my offer .
the best rate in the nation , 100 million won per episode .
100 million ?
20 episodes , so 2 bil@@ lion . once you sign the contr@@ act , you 'll be paid the total amount within 15 days .
yes ?
the total amount ?
i gu@@ aran@@ tee you the qu@@ ality of the drama .
more@@ over , as it 's being fun@@ ded by a japan@@ ese source , we can even try for a national broad@@ cast in japan .
then ...
it 's the birth of a new hal@@ ly@@ u star .
you 'll be rolling in dou@@ gh . to tell it like it is ,
i know that you need big money for the shopping mal@@ l business that you started beyond your means .
if you just sign the document you get 2 bil@@ lion .
what about the script ?
have a good look at it and meet me at the restaurant at the che@@ ong@@ dam inter@@ section .
i 'll do that .
read it fast , but pay attention .
it 's a vou@@ cher worth 2 bil@@ lion .
you 're really cool , represent@@ ative .
but do you think k@@ ang hy@@ un min will come there ?
there is one thing people know about k@@ ang hy@@ un min and one thing they don 't .
although they know that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a star , they don 't know that he 's the world 's big@@ gest idiot who only knows money .
he will come without question .
i 'm going !

if it 's writ@@ er je@@ ong hong ju ...
eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ?
wasn 't shin yang hy@@ ung going to do that ?
it 's empire 's best drama , of course we have to go with korea 's best actor .
oh my god .
aren 't you just asking me because shin yang refused it ?
what are you talking about ?
to me , the best actor in korea is always k@@ ang hy@@ un min , no question about it .
please send the script , then .
in any case , it 's writ@@ er je@@ ong hong ju who can turn everything to gold .
that gu@@ aran@@ tees the qu@@ ality of the work .
what month is the broad@@ cast ?
november . at s broadcasting .
november at s broadcasting ?
why ?
no , it 's nothing .
ah , right .
you know the guy called anthony , don 't you ?
by anthony you mean ... ah , the person who was at empire in the past .
it looks like he 's trying to start again with a japan@@ ese invest@@ ment of 10 bil@@ lion .
didn 't he come look for you ?
no , he didn 't .
ah ...
i heard there 's a problem with the japan@@ ese contr@@ act .
at any rate , i 'll send the contr@@ act to your agency .
give me a call when you make up your mind .
i understand , have a good day .
yes !
dang , now i 'm confused .
hey , hurry up and turn around .
huh ?
hy@@ ung , what about the char@@ ity event for senior cit@@ iz@@ ens ?
listen , it 's a matter of bil@@ lions of money .
i can care less about those senior cit@@ iz@@ ens !
just turn around , now !
man , i 'm so confused .
anthony ...
i see that he got to talk to k@@ ang hy@@ un min before i did ...
what do you think ?
what did you think , hy@@ ung ? darling , if i had the br@@ ains to tell whether a script is good or not , would i ask you ?
i really like it .
i 've never seen any drama like this before .
it 's re@@ fresh@@ ing .
is it .. ?
but hy@@ ung , shouldn 't you be talking to the represent@@ ative ?
don 't worry , i can talk to him after making up my mind .
telling them too soon will only cause head@@ aches .
then , hy@@ ung , what are you going to do ?
this one or the empire 's ?
well ... honestly ...
i like this , but ... but i 'm not sure if anthony really got fun@@ ding from a japan@@ ese source or if he 's blu@@ ff@@ ing ...
hy@@ ung , if it 's not certain isn 't it better to go with empire ?
empire .
empire .
empire .
gos@@ h , this gives me a head@@ ache .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's manager just called .
his high@@ school teacher died , so he had to go to the funeral .
so he can 't come here today .
it 's oh jin wan .
par@@ don ?
the empire has tar@@ get@@ ed k@@ ang hy@@ un min and played some tr@@ icks .
se@@ on@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
it 's me .
i see that you talked to hy@@ un min already .
what the ...
why are you so ob@@ ses@@ sed with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why do you think i 'm doing this ?
do you think i really like that idiot who can 't even write his own name in chinese ?
his voice is pa@@ the@@ tic , he thinks acting is all about pos@@ ing , he 's such a stuck@@ -up who 's crazy about money .
why would i be ob@@ ses@@ sed with him ?
i 'm just ... using him to destroy you , se@@ on@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
is this ... a challenge ?
the one sitting on the thr@@ one of the empire is me .
and as long as i 'm empire 's represent@@ ative , you definitely won 't be able to make a come@@ back .
represent@@ ative , it 's a bad news !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min , confir@@ med casting for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2
seeing that they 've already publ@@ ished news articles about casting k@@ ang hy@@ un min for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 , i guess the empire has already taken action .
find out where k@@ ang min hy@@ ung is .
right now .
yes .
i 'm going to k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's house .
what are you doing ?
aren 't you going to see that intellig@@ ent actor with an air of melan@@ chol@@ y ?
me too ?
since we don 't have a director yet , we should at least introdu@@ ce the ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er to him .
should i go ?
where on earth do you think he went ?
that 's what i want to ask now .
yes ?
we found him , director .
today is an actor kim jin wo@@ o 's birthday and everyone is inside a vi@@ p room drinking alcohol .
thank you , thank you !
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
thanks .
hey . you 're really made the right choice . i just came back from china after film@@ ing some drama there , but anthony , that son of b * * ch , is acting up to come back , i guess .
he can 't come back . he 's a jer@@ k you should never work with .
why do you not like that guy ?
you don 't have to know that far .
it 's not just one or two people who hate anthony in this field .
oh , that 's right . thinking of that , the girl you dat@@ ed with a few years ago , anthony took her away from you , right ?
who did that ?
got it ? okay !
che@@ ers .
it 's been a long time .
wow , indeed , i can 't win over you , represent@@ ative kim .
want a drink ?
we should do introduc@@ tions .
this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , the writ@@ er of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong . "
hello .
director , you really ...
this there a reason for me to meet this person ?
how much do you want ?
did you not see the article ?
i will give you more ( money ) than empire . how much do you want ?
represent@@ ative , i 've decided to work for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 . "
okay , fine .
you can trust empire production .
but , you 'd better not trust oh jin wan of empire production .
what on earth is the reason that you 're so ob@@ ses@@ sed for k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why would i be ?
do you think i 'm doing this because i like that guy who is too ignor@@ ant to write his own name in chinese charac@@ ters ?
he has terrible vocal , and thinks his acting is the best .
that ru@@ de jer@@ k who is crazy about only money , why would i ob@@ s@@ ess about him ?
i 'm just ... using him to destroy you , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
hey , you guys , leave us alone .
i 'm going crazy ... represent@@ ative oh , that son of b * * ch !
ge@@ ez , how embarras@@ sing !
are you insan@@ e ?
did you have to turn it on in front of those guys ?
are you going to do it or not ?
i 'll do it .
but will just ask you something .
why are you two like that to each other ?
i will tell you tru@@ th@@ fully .
this is the war between me and oh jin wan of empire production .
and you 're now on board of my ship .
the war . it 's already started . during the first shooting of " top secrets , " the drama which was planned to be ai@@ red in november , because of some accident of choi ta@@ e jo@@ on , the main actor , he was re@@ commen@@ ded to have 8 weeks of rest and he 's now getting treated at the hospital .
production team for this drama decided that no more shooting is possible .
so the drama " top secrets " is cancel@@ ed . as for its re@@ placement drama , we 're looking into all possible op@@ tions with op@@ en-@@ mind , but so far , there is nothing decided yet .
director ! there is a ru@@ mor that " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " will re@@ place that , but is it true ?
please tell us more !
is it true that writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o 's drama will be ai@@ red ?
then , what is the best among those op@@ tions ?
director , it 's of course " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of empire production .
it seems that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is in the casting . well , it 's not like he has signed a contr@@ act , and there is only its title , not even the syno@@ p@@ sis , so how can we say if it 's good or bad ?
cp na , how could say that ?
if writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o heard that , she would 've been upset .
what na moon young said isn 't totally wrong .
even if it 's je@@ ong hong jo@@ o from empire , we don 't have to beg her first .
then , what 's the best among the dram@@ as with scrip@@ ts ? well , considering only the drama itself , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong se@@ ong " is the best .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is going to work with me for my drama .
yes , reporter park .
i 've met him in this morning and finished all the discus@@ sion .
he 's on bad ter@@ ms with his represent@@ ative , so he even asked me ( for this role ) .
what do you mean , empire ?
hy@@ un min said he hasn 't even met anyone from empire . [ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , didn 't even meet production team for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " ]
will he play in a drama which doesn 't even have a script ? [ will k@@ ang hy@@ un min play for eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ? - no script is made yet . ]
that 's right , he said it was just one of all dram@@ as he was looking into .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min ' eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ' cast " no ! " ]
director !
right now k@@ ang hy@@ un min@@ -
so you 're trying to do some media play ?
in real time , the re@@ fut@@ ation news is being up@@ lo@@ aded .
what shall we do ?
what shall we do ?
contact the represent@@ ative of his agency .
aig@@ oo , seriously !
hey !
how could you decide such important matter without me ?
if you discus@@ s with me , will i take more commission from you ?
hy@@ un min , it 's empire , empire !
do you want to fight against represent@@ ative oh and finish your actor 's life ?
a@@ igo , seriously , you br@@ at .
hy@@ un min ! damn ! i 've lost my face in front of my friends , but if i work with repr@@ ent@@ ative oh , those guys will think of me a mor@@ on !
i will make represent@@ ative oh apologi@@ ze to you !
do you want him to apologi@@ ze in front of all those guys ?
oh , i don 't know !
i don 't know , i don 't know !
director oh a@@ igo , i could barely persu@@ ade hy@@ un min .
yes .
please don 't worry .
all those articles which anthony released are now removed .
i 've just received that report .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , recon@@ fir@@ med to act for " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " ]
so , who finally got hold of k@@ ang hy@@ un min , repr@@ ent@@ ative oh or anthony ?
well , i can 't figure it out , either .
there are even some articles which dis@@ appear if you cl@@ ick them .
but if you go to some other sites , again you can find ... tell both of them to come to my office immediately .
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , i think i clearly warned you .
then , i will war@@ n you too .
i got k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
haven 't you seen all those articles getting removed weak@@ ly ?
i 'll get to the point . whether bringing the contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min to me , or bringing hy@@ un min in front of me , bring me something firm .
director , are you now doub@@ ting about me because of anthony 's media play ?
i 'm the represent@@ ative of empire .
represent@@ ative oh . even if you 're the represent@@ ative of empire production , the drama director here is me !
as you want , director , i will bring k@@ ang hy@@ un min in front of you . anthony , there is no one who would fall for your words , so just make sure to bring him .
by 11 am tomorrow , before our meeting for broadcasting sched@@ ule , bring k@@ ang hy@@ un min in front of me .
the person who br@@ ings k@@ ang hy@@ un min tomorrow will be the ow@@ ner of november time s@@ lot .
the number you called is busy now .
the number you called is busy now .
pd jo@@ o , what about k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
represent@@ ative choi , what about k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
what ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is under water ? ( impl@@ ying " hiding without any contact detail " )
even without road manager kw@@ ang so@@ o , he 's been out of reach for 8 hours .
out of reach ?
have you search@@ ed all possible places ?
are you sure he went under water ?
if k@@ ang hy@@ un min went under water , he wouldn 't go where he usually goes .
from now on , anyone who is close to hy@@ un min , whether it 's an actor , or a manager , find those people who are staying home today and visit all those houses .
their hom@@ es ?
don 't you know that k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a video game ad@@ dic@@ t ?
you 're his road manager , but what did you do , not st@@ icking to hy@@ un min ?
well , i went to the rest room , but when i came back , he was gone ...
i 'm sorry .
where do you think he will possibly go ?
he 's not at j@@ ang ge@@ un se@@ ok 's house .
what about your side ?
he 's not at ji sung 's house , either . as k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's cell phone is still turned on , i was going to ask yo@@ on g@@ ye sang 's help , thinking he might answer to his call , but g@@ ye sang s@@ si isn 't not ans@@ wering my call .
i 've already tried that meth@@ od .
cell phone .... ?
i 've already tried that meth@@ od .
cell phone .... ?
long time no see , detective lee .
so you want us to track down the location of k@@ ang hy@@ un min using his cell phone ?
yes , that bastard 's cell phone is on .
you know , that 's il@@ legal .
i know it 's il@@ legal . that 's why i 'm asking you .
hello professor , this is lee go e@@ un .
i talked to you before about doing some background research for a drama . actually , there is something i 'm not quite clear about , actually , there is something i 'm not quite clear about , so i was wondering if i could meet with you again .
yes , mor@@ n@@ ings are fine with me .
of course .
then i 'll see you at the school .
thanks .
that k@@ ang hy@@ un min bastard , maybe he 's passed out somewhere drunk on purpose to anno@@ y us .
on purpose ?
would he have taken his game consol@@ e if he did it on purpose ?
how do you know that he took his game consol@@ e with him ?
well , actually , the thing is ...
just sp@@ it it out !
he said he 'd fire me if i talked !

mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , this is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , i 'm from the world production .
you saw me the other day .
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
how did she know that i 'm here ?
i know you 're in there .
open the door !
man , i 've seen it already .
i saw what you were doing with that act@@ ress . i can spread the news !
i mean it !
just open the door !
who in their right mind would open the door when hiding ?
ye@@ e-@@ ha !
stop , stop !
i got you !
hold still !
you want to die ?
i 've got to get dressed !
if you don 't want to die , get up and lift up your hands . you , do you even know what kind of a gun that is ?
are you crazy ?
sure . i 'm completely crazy .
so you should get out of here if you want to live .
i 'd rather die than go out like this . lady , i have a wife and children .
i 'll give you back your money .
i don 't need it .
just spar@@ e me !
you just pay attention to the road !
yes , represent@@ ative .
i 'm on my way with mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
where ?
what ?
where ?
writ@@ er lee ?
writ@@ er lee !
let go ! let go of it !
i can 't die like this !
ah !
hey !
just turn the volume down already !
what an idiot !
writ@@ er lee ! lee go e@@ un , what happened ? !
let go !
i said , let go !
i can 't let you go !
threaten@@ ing with an um@@ bre@@ lla isn 't enough ?
let go !
if you don 't come with me , we can 't produce our drama !
what 's that got to do with me ?
do you really think you can make me come with you ?
just listen to me for once , then i 'll let you go .
what ?
i know that only you can make up your mind . that you call the sho@@ ts .
but just keep this in mind .
i will try my best to show how ser@@ o@@ ius , how mar@@ vel@@ ous of an actor you are .
that 's why you 're just a ro@@ o@@ kie . all the writ@@ ers write for me , the protagon@@ ist , the very k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
understand ?
yes , it 's me .
how did it go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
we 're bringing him with us .
just wait for a little while .
great ! represent@@ ative , even if neither of them get k@@ ang hy@@ un min , empire productions has far better conditions .
that 's correct .
plus , represent@@ ative oh is bringing k@@ ang hy@@ un min right now .
well then , it 's pretty much decided .
then , the mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day s@@ lot for dram@@ as in november shall go to the empire production 's eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 ...
what are you doing ?
par@@ don me .
how dare you bar@@ ge in ? !
get out !
my name is k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i 'll do my best .
it 's not over yet .
i 'll turn the tables when they least expect it .
does living like that make you happy at all ?
in this world , those with power op@@ press the lo@@ ser@@ s .
the broad@@ cast sched@@ ule report is not avail@@ able ?
bring me the bank statement with proof of fun@@ ds for the production .
if you can only produce it by co@@ vering everything up with money , i don 't want that .
why don 't you step down ?
i mean , i 'm fir@@ ing you .
leave .
episode 4 the@@ ar@@ to@@ f war alright , i understand . represent@@ ative ,
anthony did end up with the broadcasting s@@ lot . k@@ ang hy@@ un min is with anthony right now . represent@@ ative oh , i 'm truly sorry .
this is so not like hy@@ un min ... why would he do this ? why would he ... ?
represent@@ ative choi , do you think that that is a vali@@ d excuse ?
don 't ever expect to see me again .
represent@@ ative , represent@@ ative !
i didn 't mean ...
represent@@ ative !
wow , seriously ...
i can 't win with you , represent@@ ative .
you even sent people all the way there to track me down .
this is incredi@@ ble !
at any rate , why did you change your mind all of a sudden ?
why did i change my mind ? from now on , i will write only for you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min . i will do my best to show in my writing what an ear@@ nest , pr@@ ais@@ e@@ wor@@ thy actor you are .
that 's why you 're just a ro@@ o@@ kie . all the other writ@@ ers are already doing it . writing for the protagon@@ ist , the star , me .
understand ?
by the way , did you mean it ?
what ?
that you will write for me .
that you will try to prove what an aw@@ esome actor i am .
do you really mean that ?
of course !
then listen .
if you don 't keep that promise , you 'll be in big trouble .
understand ?
yes .
i think you are mist@@ ak@@ en .
my decision has always been the same .
i just went away to study the script .
there was no need for such a fus@@ s .
so we were pan@@ icking for nothing .
i 'm a man of my word .
how can a man ever change his word ?
by the way , represent@@ ative .
about that writ@@ er , what kind of a person is she ?
does she stay true to her words ? represent@@ ative , as we had origin@@ ally planned , let 's s@@ late eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 for next year ...
it 's not over yet . director heo , go ahead with our prepar@@ ations .
yes . anthony , just wait for a little bit .
i will turn the tables on you when you least expect it .
have you lost your mind completely ?
hey , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ! no matter how good@@ -@@ looking you are , it doesn 't take much to lose your shine in this field .
if you 're going to call all the sho@@ ts at your w@@ him , do you even need me ?
are you suggest@@ ing that you don 't need me any more ?
that 's right .
to be honest , i don 't need you any more . whether i 'm good@@ -@@ looking or not , it 's thanks to me that you 're making money .
tell me , is it not ?
hy@@ un min , what i mean is ... if that 's not what you mean , just shut your mouth .
also , since i pro@@ cu@@ red this contr@@ act , i 'm not giving you a single penny for it .
got it ?
g@@ wang so@@ o , let 's go .
yes .
ar@@ gh , that ras@@ cal ... !
hy@@ ung , each time i see this team , they just brigh@@ ten my day .
aig@@ oo , she pl@@ ays co@@ y ...
no matter how you sl@@ ice it , when it comes to looks , our bit na is the best .
yes , her looks are the best .
bit na , is something wrong ?
i don 't know , i 'm just pissed .
why , why ?
even at our last concert , they wouldn 't let me say anything to the audience !
who the he@@ ck did that ? chief go , saying that if fans hear my voice , they will be completely put off .
that stupid chief go needs to learn a les@@ son .
what 's wrong with our bit na 's voice ?
it 's unique and sexy !
i don 't know !
bit na , you wanted a new car , right ?
why ?
i 'll buy you one .
a nice one .
are you serious ?
i 've got a big pay@@ ment coming in .
then i 'll buy you one .
op@@ pa ... i la la , i love you !
i suppose all your experience coun@@ ts for something , seeing that you managed to bring in k@@ ang hy@@ un min when the empire failed to do that .
you know , once i target an actor , i never let go .
i was wondering if you had lost your touch since you weren 't doing so well for 3 years .
so , what about the script ?
working on episode 5 now .
she 's done pretty well so far for someone without any publications or awards .
yes , indeed .
however , that ends here .
let her finish what she 's working on .
then switch to a more se@@ as@@ oned writ@@ er .
what ?
need@@ less to say , the production will go live soon enough .
you can 't do that with a new@@ bie like that .
i heard that all she 's got is some experience as an assistant to writ@@ er je@@ ong . is that right ?
yes , that is correct , but ...
just get a different writ@@ er .
i 'm telling you this as the director of the broadcasting station .
represent@@ ative , you 're back .
you 're back .
what 's all this ?
oh , represent@@ ative , you 're back .
why are you in such a good mood ?
my mom is here .
represent@@ ative , how have you been ? how have you been ? since my go e@@ un wasn 't coming home for nights working on the script ,
i 've come to make sure that you 're fe@@ eding her well . oh , mother ( of go e@@ un ) , you should come often .
the food is so good .
hadn 't had a hom@@ e-@@ cook@@ ed meal in a long time .
exactly , mother .
you should have some , too , represent@@ ative .
i have e@@ aten already .
oh , how fortun@@ ate that i pack@@ ed some extra .
keep it in the fri@@ dge so that represent@@ ative can have it later .
alright .
is my daughter doing alright ?
yes .
i trust you to take good care of her .
i shall excuse myself now .
have a safe trip back .
mom , you 're leaving already ?
yes , it 's already late for me to get ready for the evening rush .
i 'll see my mom to the bus station .
writ@@ er lee !
yes ?
i need to talk with you , why don 't you say goodbye now ?
yes ?
that 's right .
you just stay here and talk with him . i 'll get a taxi .
- bye , and please come again .
- thanks for the food !
what is it ?
i will cut to the chase .
in ad@@ dition to the contr@@ act fee , i 'll give you a bonus , so 30 million won ( ~ $ 30@@ k in usd ) in total .
yes ?
what does that mean ... ?
i would like you to step down now .
what do you mean by that ?
i 'm fir@@ ing you .
so leave .
on what gro@@ unds ?
if you want to know , i 'll tell you .
i used you to get the invest@@ ment , and now that i don 't need you , i 'm deser@@ ting you .
you asked me if i wanted to spend the rest of my life gr@@ il@@ ling mac@@ ker@@ els .
seemed like your mac@@ ker@@ el business is going well , that 's not a bad way of spen@@ ding the rest of your life .
- you said , dreams ex@@ ist to be ful@@ filled , not remin@@ is@@ ced .
- i lied to convince you ... you can 't tell me to leave .
it 's my writing !
my baby !
i 'm sorry , but we 've already found a new writ@@ er .
what a s@@ cum .
yes , maybe not the world 's low@@ est , but the low@@ est s@@ cum in korea for sure .
so leave . i can 't !
i won 't !
i 'd rather die !
i 'll go to the drama department and tell them all about what a s@@ cum you are .
you would better not do that .
you 'll only face the reality of how pa@@ the@@ tic you are .
what ?
it was the drama department that asked for a new writ@@ er .
hey , you there !
hey ! hey !
we 'll have to see when the first draft ....
what , what is this ?
i am writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
so what ?
i know that i 'm being ru@@ de , but i just had to ask a question .
i just heard from the production company that they 're getting a new writ@@ er .
they said that a new writ@@ er was re@@ quest@@ ed by the drama department . is that true ?
yes , it is .
i know i 'm a ro@@ o@@ kie , with no publication or broadcasting experience .
however , didn 't you give us the s@@ lot based on my writing ?
please , give me a chance .
do you have any idea where you are ?
director ...
you said it yourself .
that you have no publications or broadcasting experience . as the final person in charge , i 'm telling you as the director of the drama department .
we can 't let a ro@@ o@@ kie with no publication or broadcasting experience go out to war .
it is better off not to start a war when defe@@ at is evi@@ dent .
then , i 'm ... in a nut@@ shell , as long as you 're not in the team , this war can be won .
if i 've made myself clear , go now .
if ... if i leave , can you gu@@ aran@@ tee that this war will be won ?
what ?
you probably can 't .
nobody knows for sure .
you can only exc@@ el if given an opportunity .
even if i have to leave the production , i just wanted to say this to you .
what the ... what a br@@ at ... how insol@@ ent ...
she may be fe@@ ist@@ y , but she 's right .
huh , what ?
yes ?
what did you just say ?
no , just ramb@@ ling . represent@@ ative , are you asleep ?
speak .
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ... will she be alright ?
she seemed to be in a lot of shock .
forget about it and just sleep .
i 'm trying , but i can 't sleep .
what did i tell you ?
to make a drama ...
one must leave even if it is his own father .
yes , so keep that in mind and sleep .
tomorrow , we 'll get the contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min ready .
yes .
aun@@ ty , can you hurry up a bit ?
alright !
what are you doing ?
g@@ wang so@@ o , stop .
you 're here .
i told you to work out , not to show yourself off working out .
they 're all dying to see me though .
all these girls have come here to see this face and this body .
i guess it doesn 't hurt to sign the contr@@ act among flowers .
the ter@@ ms are as we had discus@@ sed before . as soon as you sign the contr@@ act , you 'll get 2 bil@@ lion won in 15 days , all in one lum@@ p sum .
g@@ wang so@@ o , my stam@@ p .
let 's break a leg !
just de@@ pos@@ it the money within the set time .
what do you mean ?
you can 't issue a certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot ?
we 've already signed a contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and changed the writ@@ er . you can 't issue a certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot ? we 've already signed a contr@@ act with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and changed the writ@@ er .
why can 't you issue us a certific@@ ate when you 've already given us the s@@ lot ?
who says i 'm not issu@@ ing you one ?
bring me the bank statement that has the fun@@ ds for this production .
what ?
not something you just type up on word , but an actual bank book that shows the money .
director ...
you know it , too .
how many drama productions bite off more than they can che@@ w , and end up in a w@@ rec@@ k with in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent fun@@ ds .
that hur@@ ts the reputation of the broadcasting station as well !
once you give me the certific@@ ate , i get the invest@@ ment from japan .
not just a couple bil@@ lion , but 10 bil@@ lion !
well then , show me the bank book with that 10 bil@@ lion .
director ...
a certific@@ ate of a broadcasting s@@ lot comes with my official se@@ al to re@@ present the broadcasting station .
if you want my se@@ al , show me the money first .
we have to de@@ pos@@ it the 2 bil@@ lion for k@@ ang hy@@ un min , too . what now ?
if he doesn 't get that 2 bil@@ lion , he 'll go with someone else for sure .
then , the whole drama is ..
what if we explained our situation to the japan@@ ese spon@@ sor ?
i 've already contac@@ ted the person in charge , it 's the same story .
an official document of the broadcasting sched@@ ule .
what the s broadcasting director wants is not bank books .
here , take a shot .
- che@@ ers - thanks for your hard work .
i heard that they 're swit@@ ching the writ@@ er for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
that lee go e@@ un , who wrote the syno@@ p@@ sis , came to the director and made a scene , i heard .
but it 's a new genre we 've not done before .
how much better could an experienced writ@@ er be ?
in the end , it is up to the production skil@@ ls of represent@@ ative kim of the world production .
and we all know that rec@@ ently , many production compan@@ ies start shooting , then run out of money , and end up not pay@@ ing the ac@@ tors and the film@@ ing crew .
we 've seen so many cas@@ es like that .
if you 're giving the s@@ lot to represent@@ ative kim , it would be good to make sure about the fun@@ ding situation .
i know , i already told anthony about secur@@ ing the fun@@ ds .
you have a visit@@ or .
good evening .
hey , represent@@ ative kim !
what br@@ ings you here ?
i came here to get dinner , and i heard that you were here , so i 've come to say hi .
oh , i see . come in , come in .
yes .
i was thinking about what you said earlier today , director .
and i admit that i was in the wrong .
as you had re@@ quest@@ ed , i will bring you a bank book showing the fun@@ ds and also draw up a budget plan .
of course , that you should .
here , have a drink .
huh ?
what are you doing outside ?
i have a favor to ask , director .
a favor ?
i heard that you play golf in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong lat@@ ely ... give me the combin@@ ation of your lo@@ cker , and i 'll prepare something for you by tomorrow .
represent@@ ative kim ...
it 's just a to@@ ken of my appreci@@ ation .
please take it .
appreci@@ ation for what ?
the certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot .
hey , anthony , are you still doing this crap ?
what about you , director ?
what ? last year , on march 24 and september 13 , k@@ j production sent you some to@@ ken appreci@@ ations .
watch your words .
i thought they were just rum@@ ors .
that 's right . totally sen@@ sel@@ ess rum@@ ors .
got it ?
yes , i 'm sure .
alright .
oh , would you check if my car is parked ok outside ?
it 's black , and the number is 89@@ 11 .
yes , i shall , director .
are you still doing things this way ?
what ... do you mean ?
i guess people never change .
since i had a drink , i 'll just say one thing as a man .
represent@@ ative kim , i ... hate you . ( dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s )
i especially hate those dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness of how you do your business .
yes , those dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness are exactly how i 've been doing my business , and i 'll continue to do so .
now , think about it .
how much longer do you think you 'll be in the drama department , chief produc@@ er nam ?
the way i see it , with all the promo@@ tions , 5 years at best ?
do you even have a plan for your reti@@ rement ?
that 's why you 're such a low jer@@ k , bastard .
thank you .
i 'm pay@@ ing for my own drin@@ ks .
have you looked into the things i asked you about ?
oh , that ?
i 've found a few after some intern@@ al investig@@ ation .
just as i told you , right ?
what would you like me to do ?
kill him .
so that he 'll never come near this field ...
aj@@ umma , another bottle of so@@ ju .
- here , another bottle .
- thanks .
- aun@@ ty , we 'd like another gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el .
- yes . yes , coming !
hey , what are you doing here ?
because they liked my script so much , i 'm on vac@@ ation .
well then , hurry up and gr@@ ill some mac@@ ker@@ els .
can 't you see how busy we are ?
yes , madame k@@ ang . ( madame ten@@ ac@@ ity )
the money ?
it will be with@@ drawn from the bank in 30 minutes .
oh@@ hy@@ ung golf course in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong .
director moon 's lo@@ cker number and combin@@ ation .
89@@ 11 ?
89@@ 11 ... no , put it in your mouth and swal@@ low it .
what ? we can 't leave any trace behind unless they cut our gut@@ s open .
get the money and deli@@ ver it right away .
i 'll go get the certific@@ ate of broadcasting s@@ lot .
yes , i got it .
where did they all go with the door open ?
writ@@ er lee ...
i just came to get my stuff ...
what is that ? yes ? oh , it 's nothing .
well , you know , miss writ@@ er , it is in@@ evit@@ able for the production to start , so ... it just happens this way .
i guess " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be the inaugur@@ al work of world production .
yes .
break a leg .
thank you .
and the writ@@ er ?
still in search for a dec@@ ent experienced one .
good .
alright , you may leave .
well , have a good day . one of my assist@@ ants just stopped by the oh@@ hy@@ ung golf course in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong , and says that it looks really nice , perhaps they 've renov@@ ated the interior .
you should go check it out .
so , has the fun@@ ding issue been resol@@ ved ?
yes , he got the money from a japan@@ ese spon@@ sor .
there 's nothing to worry .
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
wow , represent@@ ative kim has done it in the end !
how impres@@ sive .
right ?
in that dirty way .
it 's all thanks to your concer@@ ns .
do you know how many har@@ d-@@ working profession@@ als in this field fall in desp@@ air because of people like you ?
yes , i 'm well aware of them .
i 'm one of those profession@@ als in this field as well .
excuse me .
yes , director .
hey , you bastard .
is this a joke ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
how dare you make a fool of me ?
that 's not possible .
why would the money be missing ?
hello , hello !
dire@@ c ..@@ .... produc@@ er jo@@ o , what happened ?
did you make the deli@@ very ?
well , that@@ is ...
represent@@ ative ...
hurry up and tell me !
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un has hid the money bag , so i couldn 't even leave the office .
what ?
represent@@ ative .
where did you put it ? you were acting as though everything will go smooth@@ ly if i wasn 't on the team , but in reality , you had to use such dirty means !
it doesn 't matter .
why doesn 't it matter ?
i didn 't leave just so you could do this !
you left on your own . just give it up .
where is that money ? the money is for produc@@ ing the drama , not for lo@@ bb@@ ying with bri@@ bes like that .
you don 't know anything , stay out of it .
then explain it then .
there 's no time for that .
just tell me , where is that money ?
i won 't say a word until you convince me completely .
without that money , this drama won 't happen .
are you happy now ? your writing will not be broad@@ cast . if you have to cover everything up with money to produce it ,
i don 't need it .
i 'm the original writ@@ er ,
forget about it then .
produc@@ er jo@@ o .
yes .
when , and how did she hide it ? while i was away for a sec , at least she didn 't leave this place . um@@ m , represent@@ ative , the golf putting range clo@@ ses in 30 minutes .
miss writ@@ er , represent@@ ative isn 't doing this because he wants to .
don 't just stand there like that , and say something !
won 't you ?
move .
why should i move ?
i said move !
aren 't you getting out of the way ? you keep ignoring me , you 'd better get a law@@ yer . even if you get the production going with bri@@ bes ,
i will make sure that it doesn 't get ai@@ red !
sue all you want .
you 'll be watching my drama as you wait for the proce@@ eding .
open it !
open it !
hey !
man , i keep missing the ball ! it 's not just the balls i 'm missing . my arms and legs feel like they 're not mine .
yes , it 's me , director .
there was a slight accident on our part , but i 'm just calling you now to tell you that i deli@@ vered it myself .
yes , sorry .
yes .
you 've still got something to say ?
you !
you know what ?
what ?
what an e@@ e@@ evil ( sl@@ ur@@ red spe@@ ech as she 's drunk ) nast@@ y , dirty , jer@@ k you are ?
do you know what a col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , cruel , in@@ fern@@ al s@@ cum you are ?
you called me to ask me that ?
sure , i 'll give you my answer .
i am aware of it . more than any@@ body in the world . living like that , are you happy ?
living stup@@ id@@ ly like you , how is that ?
what about you living so stup@@ id@@ ly , being tr@@ amp@@ led and tor@@ n apart ?
i am not un@@ happy .
because , despite the world being dirty like you , i am living .
your kind doesn 't understand the world .
the world has been very dirty from the beginning . by fair means or fou@@ l , emer@@ ging victor@@ ious through force , and domin@@ ating the lo@@ ser@@ s is the world .
i am going to trium@@ ph in this fil@@ thy world .
you are going to fall .
there 's something else you don 't know .
in my mind now , to be living here is hell .
hy@@ ung , you 're not coming back tonight ?
probably not .
hy@@ ung , it 's a guest .
guest ?
ap@@ ologies for coming so late at night .
i don 't know if you 've heard but i won 't be able to keep my promise .
i 'm really than@@ k@@ ful that you liked my work , but for un@@ avo@@ id@@ able circum@@ stances , i had to quit .
what ?
so are they changing the writ@@ er ?
you got fired then .
yes .
i got fired . i got fired because i don 't have any experience .
at any rate , although i won 't be working on it any more , the script still means a lot to me .
please , treat that script like a child that has lost its mother until the very end and ful@@ fill your role with affec@@ tion .
so ?
did you come to me to get you un@@ fired ?
no , i didn 't come for that at all .
i just ...
but , what do you mean by " no ? " you tried everywhere else , it didn 't work , so you 've come here , preten@@ ding to be nice , asking me to help you , right ? asking me to help you , right ?
no , i 'm not like that .
it 's no use .
come to think of it , i was a bit nervous about the writ@@ er being a ro@@ o@@ kie .
this is for the best .
don 't get your heart broken over this . it 's the nature of this field .
that 's not it !
what the he@@ ck ?
i put my everything at st@@ ake for my " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
though i 'm leaving , i want you all to take it seriously with affec@@ tion .
is that so hard , you idi@@ ots ?
! is she crazy ?
what are you doing ?
drag her out of here .
yes . leave .
you mor@@ ons !
- you 're so drunk .
- it 's mine !
- what 's yours ?
- just go !
- let go of me !
you can 't just get drunk and bar@@ ge in like that . living like that , does it make you happy ?
scre@@ en@@ writ@@ er : lee go e@@ un
hey , un@@ ni !
hey , watch your driving !
that was close .
wow , you 're pretty .
- no@@ on@@ im , how old are you ?
- how old are you ?
- un@@ ni , you see , we 're hungry ...
- ai@@ ii@@ ii@@ ish .... hey , get out all you 've got . hey , get out all you 've got .
stop staring like that and give us your money !
ah well , can 't be helped .
good evening , police officer . good evening , police officer .
i 'm on the back@@ street by hy@@ und@@ ai villa in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ -@@ dong .
three drunk high@@ scho@@ ol@@ ers are trying to do something to another drunk woman .
oh , i 'm just a ci@@ vili@@ an cit@@ izen .
one that pays a lot of tax@@ es .
please dis@@ pat@@ ch someone here quick . thanks !
well ...
i 'm ... really in a bad mood tonight ...
so .. could you guys just ... leave me alone ?
wow , did i just hear that right ?
hey , do you want to die ?
you 'd better let go of me .
honestly ...
what is she ?
you high@@ school br@@ ats !
aren 't you supposed to be stud@@ ying ?
dang , i should have avo@@ i@@ ded her eyes .
at any rate , is she really a writ@@ er ?
she 's like a gang@@ ster !
how scar@@ y .
jesus christ !
yes ?
well , do you know lee go e@@ un ?
so if i do ?
this is gang@@ nam police department . i understand that she was drunk , but what kind of a lady be@@ ats up three kids like that by herself ?
she passed out once she got here , and we didn 't know who to contact .
we checked her recent call history , and saw that she had made several calls to you .
at any rate , what is your relationship to her ?
she put you down as " yo@@ un@@ de@@ ung@@ po crazy dog " on her contac@@ ts list .
so i got curious .
three million won ( ~ $ 3@@ k usd ) for a sett@@ lement isn 't too bad .
is it ok if she sp@@ ends the night here ?
huh ?
um@@ m ..
hey hey ! today , on the olympic expres@@ s@@ way in seoul , a drunk truck driver cras@@ hed his truck and killed one person .
at the time of the accident , the blood alcohol content of truck driver kim had ex@@ ce@@ eded the level of 0.1 % , which means his license will be suspen@@ ded .
the police are still investig@@ ating the exact circum@@ stances of the accident , and plan to charge truck driver kim with du@@ i .
on another note , early this morning , the director of the drama department of a certain broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
it has been announced that moon is suspected of charges of accep@@ ting bri@@ bes relat@@ ed to privil@@ eg@@ es associ@@ ated with drama broadcasting slo@@ ts .
the police announced that they will investig@@ ate the matters further and will se@@ ek str@@ ict correc@@ tive me@@ as@@ ures .
addit@@ ional investig@@ ations are still going on .
this news was brought to you by mb@@ s , kim so ye@@ on .
does seeing someone get arrest@@ ed give you back some senses ?
huh ?
you should thank the person who paid your sett@@ lement money . you may go .
sett@@ lement money ?
who ? that " young@@ de@@ ung@@ po crazy dog " took care of everything .
... drama department of a certain broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
... announced that he is suspected of accep@@ ting bri@@ bes privil@@ eg@@ es associ@@ ated with broadcasting slo@@ ts ....
thanks for the good news , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
it 's rather surpris@@ ing that the cul@@ prit behind all this is not on the list .
we just got the search war@@ rant , so we 're going through all his office , house , and car .
one of those places should have it .
there 's one more place to check .
one more place ?
a personal lo@@ cker at oh@@ hy@@ ung golf course in non@@ hy@@ un-@@ dong .
personal lo@@ cker ?
it is a prefer@@ red venue for one of the bri@@ be don@@ ors .
yes .
keep up with your good work .
you 've caused director moon to fall in order to get to anthony ? director moon will probably conf@@ ess everything anyway , but once the money bag is found , that 's the moment of doom for anthony .
then , that broadcasting s@@ lot goes back to nul@@ l .
sched@@ ule a meeting for tomorrow morning .
yes . yes .
i like the news today .
yes .
i understand .
the search war@@ rant is out .
as soon as we get there , crack the door open and get the evidence right away .
ah , ais@@ h .
get the to@@ ols !
this way !
there 's a guy that 's just leaving the building .
get him ! yes , i understand .
this morning , the director of the drama department of a broadcasting station , moon , was arrest@@ ed .
moon is suspected of charges of receiv@@ ing bri@@ bes for privil@@ eg@@ es regar@@ ding broadcasting slo@@ ts .
isn 't he from the broadcasting station for your drama ?
is your drama going to be ok when someone big like him gets arrest@@ ed ?
i think it 'll be ... ok .
seriously .
he should have just e@@ aten gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els instead of stu@@ ff@@ ing his gut@@ s with other people 's money .
it 's me , produc@@ er jo@@ o . i just saw the news , is that money ok ?
oh , it was close .
fortunately , represent@@ ative saw the news and took immedi@@ ate action , so it 's all safe .
it was really close . we were so lucky .
then , there 's no problem with the drama ?
well , i 'm not sure , for the moment ...
hello .
miss writ@@ er , i 'm sorry , but i have to go to a meeting now .
if anything changes or gets decided , i 'll contact you .
now that the director has been arrest@@ ed , empire will try to shake up the broadcasting sched@@ ule .
how are things at empire ?
they sub@@ mit@@ ted the syno@@ p@@ sis of " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of writ@@ er je@@ ong yesterday through assistant director kim .
i heard that the syno@@ p@@ sis is 10 pages long .
you can get a s@@ lot even without a syno@@ p@@ sis , and this is " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 . "
what is writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o doing ?
working on the script for the first two episodes .
no@@ tif@@ y me as soon as the first dr@@ af@@ ts are done .
who are the potential candidat@@ es for the next director of s broadcasting ? based on the accompl@@ ish@@ ments from last year and the first half of this year , assistant director park is most likely .
have you e@@ aten yet ?
he started out as an open re@@ cru@@ it , and has the reputation of being a nice person with good skil@@ ls among the produ@@ cer@@ s , so many direc@@ tors support him .
however , based on school ties , some predic@@ t that assistant director kim , who went to the same school as the president of s broadcasting , will be the one .
also , assistant director kim 's wife is known for her influence .
she even moved their family residence so that their children would go to the same school as the president 's .
that says a lot .
assistant director kim ....
it was empire 's oh jin wan that caused the fall of director moon .
what ?
yesterday , the syno@@ p@@ sis of writ@@ er je@@ ong was given to a.@@ d. kim , and director moon was arrest@@ ed this morning .
to plan an ar@@ rest without a war@@ rant the very day of today ... means that they predic@@ ted that we 'd bri@@ be director moon .
you mean , the person who repor@@ ted director moon to the author@@ ities is ...
he wanted to get me arrest@@ ed .
the decision of cho@@ os@@ ing a new director is up to the president .
the most likely candi@@ date is a.@@ d. kim .
no@@ tif@@ y me as soon as s broadcasting makes the announ@@ cement of the personnel changes tomorrow .
yes .
you all go home .
yes .
the personnel changes have been announced .
[ announ@@ c@@ ements from the human re@@ sources department ]
- what is this ?
- what does this mean ?
the director is coming !
good morning .
well done .
let me count on your assistance .
i expect much gu@@ id@@ ance from you all .
let 's take our se@@ ats .
we would like to turn this un@@ fortun@@ ate event around and use it as a trig@@ ger to introdu@@ ce a revolution@@ ary change in the drama department of s broadcasting .
and i believe that the prior@@ ity is to en@@ sure that we produce high qu@@ ality dram@@ as , work with ac@@ tors loved by the public , and keep the production environ@@ ment clean and transpar@@ ent .
consequ@@ ently , the broadcasting sched@@ ule for november determined by the previ@@ ous director is going to be totally re@@ vamp@@ ed .
that is all .
i don 't accept con@@ grat@@ ul@@ atory messages .
i know how you hate me the most . i 've been doing business using the dirty , sh@@ amel@@ ess ways of darkness that you hate so much , and i know how you think of me as a mor@@ ally devo@@ id person .
however , director , please give me this one chance .
i beg of you .
just one chance ?
however , that one chance might allow someone like you to control this whole field of dram@@ as .
i 've decided against it .
i won 't change my mind .
please leave .
- what 's going to happen to our s@@ lot ?
hurry ! that position should have been yours , assistant director .
show him who 's really in power in this department .
you 're not my superior !
i will get my work publ@@ ished and pro@@ udly present my name , lee go e@@ un on the script .
we 'll re@@ inst@@ ate writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
no one would write " the morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " better than her .
it 's not over yet !
why don 't you just can@@ cel your contr@@ act ?
- i 'll help you with that .
- this is all for our drama .
you mean , your drama . the weapon with which anthony , king of dram@@ as , will take back his real@@ m .
i 'll wait for you .
just don 't take too long to return .
episode 6 the division in front of enem@@ ies this is your writing contr@@ act . well , then ... sign here .
leave now . move ! - get out of my way !
- what are you guys doing ? let go . i said to move !
no , lee go e@@ un !
-@@ what is this ? !
drag him out of here !
you can 't sign !
fine , i 'll give you what you want .
i will leave its genre the same as the current one , noir .
and without the present day 's scene , i will keep the first episode same as your draft !
writ@@ er , it 's a lie .
just go ahead and sign .
what 's this ?
drag him out of here !
wait just a minute !
go on .
i 'll take out the supervis@@ or too .
writ@@ er lee , it isn 't once or twice that he 's fool@@ ed you !
because he 's desperate , he 's lying to get what he wants .
no , that 's not the case . you know how anthony works , it 's all the same as three years ago !
no , lee go e@@ un ! you 'd better be prepared for the law suit , because i 'll never lose it to you .
don 't trouble yourself about it .
you made a good decision .
yes .
we should go eat .
there is a really great japan@@ ese restaurant nearby .
next time . today i have another engagement .
ah , yes . if you were thinking of sig@@ ning from the start , what was your reason for calling me ?
do you know what you just did ?
you just tore my drama , no , my life to pieces .
didn 't know i was such an important person .
what ?
! why not ?
you get to do whatever you want to do but i can 't do what i want to do ?
that 's why i said we 'd do without the melo@@ drama as a noir , without a supervis@@ or , whatever you wanted !
exactly , so ful@@ fill all those prom@@ ises as you said .
what does that mean ?
director , you are amazing .
in the end , you really defe@@ ated anthony .
what did i say .
the one who laugh@@ s in the end is the win@@ ner .
director , what 's the matter ?
what ?
what did you just say ?
i didn 't sign .
lee go e@@ un !
next time ... so the reason you came here , was to get what you want under the pre@@ text of sig@@ ning ?
yes , so make sure you definitely keep your prom@@ ises .
since i have it recor@@ ded here .
ge@@ ez , where did you learn to do that ?
who do you think ? from you , represent@@ ative .
what ?
why are you so surprised ?
like an amateur ...
i heard this is what they usually do in the field .
do you have confidence you can do it ?
i 'm asking if you can take respon@@ sibil@@ ity for your decision .
what are you trying to say ? if in november we were to completely fa@@ il , the sun will shine as if nothing 's happened .
but you and i will be finished . i know , that it 's not just you and i , but all the people involved in this work .
we will either succe@@ ed or fa@@ il sol@@ ely on my decision .
that 's why i can 't give up .
we will win .
are you sure you can win ?
i mean , if you 're sure what 's the chance ( % ) of win@@ ning ?
you 've always told me , " believe in me . "
this time , represent@@ ative , it 's your turn to believe in me .
what is this ?
this is the key for that writing space you wanted .
my own writing place ?
so this is something you prepared ?
you thought i 'd make you write in that tiny place forever ?
we must win this war .
that ras@@ cal .
here .
over this way .
over this way .
did anyone see a cut@@ ter kn@@ ifer here ?
what ?
on that brick pil@@ lar , you shouldn 't paint with white !
not that one , but over there , please paint there .
everyone , enjoy your meal .
did you know ?
that the represent@@ ative picked this place ?
yes .
you already knew ?
yes .
- so only i didn 't know ?
! i found the place .
really ?
de@@ pos@@ it is 5 million won ( $ 5,000 ) and mon@@ th@@ ly rent fee is 300,000 won ( $ 300 ) . de@@ pos@@ it is 5 million won ( $ 5,000 ) and mon@@ th@@ ly rent fee is 300,000 won ( $ 300 ) .
where should we put this ?
just put it anywhere over here .
che@@ ers .
-@@ che@@ ers !
finally , writ@@ er lee gets her own writing space !
it was with everyone 's help .
to be honest , i never imagined director would ever get you your own place ! though director seems like a vic@@ ious man from the outside , he 's not like that on the inside .
but hy@@ ung , what kind of director will come ?
who knows ?
that ... is not going to be easy .
why ?
i think director kim hy@@ un min would be good for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
we 've done other works together , too .
you see , director kim is , uh .... difficult to get , it seems he 's already working on another piece .
then what about director je@@ ong ?
ah director je@@ ong !
.. will also be difficult .
difficult ?
uh , that 's because ...
why ?
do you possibly have another director in mind ?
no , it 's not like that !
just wait a little longer , we 're doing our best to convince ...
convince ?
there was a meeting of the regular p@@ ds that caused a problem with as@@ sig@@ ning a director for the drama .
i will never work with that jer@@ k , anthony .
when he was kicked out of this field , everybody ap@@ pl@@ au@@ ded in celebr@@ ation !
i still get upset whenever i think about the way he hum@@ ili@@ ated me ! and now , you expect me to work with him ?
yes , i understand your point . but what 's important is that this " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is not just anthony kim 's drama , but a drama of our s broadcasting . do you understand ?
you 're the one who 'd been insist@@ ing , director , that the broadcasting stations should not work with s@@ cum like him !
it 's not like he 's the represent@@ ative of empire , he 's just a represent@@ ative of a ro@@ o@@ kie thir@@ d-@@ rate ...
third rate ? !
director kim , your " paradise lost " had hit the rat@@ ing of 35.@@ 9 % .
also , director je@@ ong and director yo@@ on , you all had big hits after working with me and became represent@@ ative direc@@ tors of s broadcasting .
how can you , after ach@@ ie@@ ving your current fame thanks to me , call me a thir@@ d-@@ rate produc@@ er ?
! you call that fame ?
it was hum@@ ili@@ ation !
you were rul@@ ing the shooting sites as if you were the director .
i won 't take that again .
i took action only because you weren 't a good leader !
what ?
are you talking down to me ?
what do you think you are doing ?
this is a statement of the position of the regular p@@ ds . we 'd like to make it clear to you that every one of us , p@@ ds of s broadcasting ,
statement of refus@@ al to work refus@@ es to direct anthony 's production , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
let 's get out of here . you normally per@@ s@@ ist with your own decisions , why are you back@@ ing down this time ?
are you trying to get back at me ?
get back at you ?
get back at me for having my way with the s@@ lot .
represent@@ ative kim ...
do you judge all the people of the world by your own standards alone ?
just answer my question . i 'm the director of the drama department . reg@@ ard@@ less of whether i like the s@@ lot decision or not , once it has been decided ,
i have also put my life on the line for this drama .
happy now ?
oh , yeah ... and also ...
does it ever occu@@ r to you that your twisted ways of doing business cost you the trust of our pd 's ?
i trust vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings more than people .
also , i 'm one of .. no , more than anyone , have put my life on the line for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
if we can 't find one intern@@ ally , then ...
i 'll bring a se@@ as@@ oned vet@@ eran director from outside .
a se@@ as@@ oned vet@@ eran ?
like who ?
i think the situation will be the same outside , too .
this morning i saw this coming and i thought of someone .
director go@@ o ?
yeah .
if the intern@@ al direc@@ tors refuse to work with us , why not work with fre@@ el@@ an@@ cer@@ s like director go@@ o ?
he hasn 't done anything in a while , but he is a tried and true vet@@ eran .
he was the best at one point , with four dram@@ as that had over 30 % in vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing ...
but ... he 's a gon@@ er now .
gon@@ er ?
five years ago , when he left the field , he reti@@ red completely and lives out in the coun@@ try@@ side .
reti@@ red ?
why ?
i don 't know the speci@@ fic@@ s , but ... there are rum@@ ors that sug@@ gest that he 's become an alco@@ hol@@ ic .
well ...
i 've also heard that he 's become a dog s@@ eller in some remo@@ te place .
a dog s@@ eller ?
no way .
director go@@ o young mo@@ k is a serious alco@@ hol@@ ic who can 't even function as a person .
no way he can direct again .
no , that 's something you have to cre@@ ate .
also , wasn 't it you who had produc@@ ed the last drama of director go@@ o ?
you should know very well what a great director he is , then .
listen to me .
given our current situation , the best person for the job of direc@@ ting " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is director go@@ o young mo@@ k .
no one else will do . we 've asked other exter@@ nal direc@@ tors whose sched@@ ules are compat@@ ible , but they all said no .
it takes a dog to recognize a dog .
director ...
long time , no see ' che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong 's crazy dog . '
i don 't live in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong any more .
a dog is a dog no matter where he lives .
come inside .
what br@@ ings you all the way here ?
can 't just be to have a drink with me .
i want you to come with me to seoul .
seoul ?
that 's a real dog mess there .
what are you sch@@ em@@ ing ?
i want you to direct a drama .
drama ?
why ?
is there no one willing to direct for you ?
after not seeing you for a@@ while , you 're still making me laugh .
stop wast@@ ing your effort and go back .
i was done direc@@ ting dram@@ as 5 years ago .
that 's when my life ended , too .
first day of broadcasting is november 5@@ th , 20 episodes , period piece .
my contact information is inclu@@ ded , so give me a call after you read it .
crazy bas@@ t * * * .
you 're ru@@ in@@ ing my drink , get lost !
you 've been drinking for 5 years , haven 't you had enough ?
you 're the one that had said , the place for me to breathe and to stop breathing is the shooting site .
there 's not much time .
you have to give me a decision within 3 days .
get out !
before i stick the dogs on you !
represent@@ ative oh .
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
explain it to me .
i don 't know what you mean ... the japan@@ ese invest@@ or , the broadcasting s@@ lot !
how much longer are you going to let anthony have his way like that ?
i 'm sorry .
a ho@@ und that had been lo@@ yal to its master bit@@ es the master .
that guy ... what should we do about him ?
we must catch him .
no ...
catch him and kill him .
before he fin@@ ishes shar@@ pen@@ ing his fang@@ s in preparation of reven@@ ge .
if left alone , he 's going to attack me with those fang@@ s .
i understand .
you 'd better make sure that you do it right this time .
there are so many ho@@ unds out there to re@@ place you .
let 's go .
it 's been a@@ while .
yes . yes .
once more ... i 'll need your help .
when do you have time ?
hello everyone !
our guest today is south korea 's most popular , handsome guy , the prince in the drama industry . the top star , everyone who is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
korea 's best top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , come on out !
wow , seriously , your popular@@ ity is as high as the sky , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
oh , thank you .
everybody , as you see k@@ ang hy@@ un min in person , how do you feel ?
he 's so hot !
- he 's so handsome !
they say you are very good looking .
thank you .
when i see you here , seriously , the word " sculp@@ tu@@ re-@@ like handsome guy " used to describe you isn 't ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
oh , you over@@ pr@@ ais@@ ed me .
thank you .
wow , you 're even hum@@ ble .
indeed , you 're the top actor .
yes , yes , yes .
how do you feel about all these people coming out to see you ?
oh , well , of course , i 'm very than@@ k@@ ful .
is that so ?
yes , i 'm so grateful .
people who love k@@ ang hy@@ un min , scream !
thank you so much .
thank you , thank you .
yes , yes .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min s@@ si , i don 't think we can do an interview here !
i agree .
let 's go inside and do the interview .
shall we ?
because , in this crowd ... i just don 't think it 's possible .
i understand .
okay , everyone !
we 'll be going in now .
see you guys later !
look outside .
all your loving fans are still outside .
your popular@@ ity is incredi@@ ble !
thank you .
so , i heard you 're shooting a new drama .
yes .
the drama 's called , ' morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' and i am playing the role as ' kim wo@@ o jin . '
'@@ morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ?
' wow , the title 's very impres@@ sive .
so , is there a reason why you chose this drama over others ?
well , let 's see ...
reading the script made my whole body shud@@ der .
it gave you the shud@@ ders ?
i thought this was one drama i should never pass on .
i see ... reading the script gave you the chil@@ ls .
i 'm really looking forward to seeing this drama .
but , on another note ...
yes ?
there 's a ru@@ mor that you 're being paid the most among all ac@@ tors in the country .
that 's right isn 't it ?
that ... is not true . when i sel@@ ect a drama
i do not ever take into account how much i get paid .
i leave all that to my manager so , in truth , i have no idea how much i make .
a drama is a work of art .
i believe that exces@@ sive thought of money ... can be fat@@ al to an actor .
wow , ' exces@@ sive thought of money can be fat@@ al to an actor ?
' you are truly a great actor ....
what 's wrong ?
no matter how much i think about it , i 'm still angry .
does it even make sense that a drama is not made mel@@ o ?
this drama seems better that it 's not mel@@ o .
darling , do you think i like mel@@ o dram@@ as ?
mel@@ o is money ... money !
it has to be mel@@ o so people love the drama , and that 's exactly how i get cf off@@ ers !
ah , that 's right , the director can change that .
the director can change it towards a more mel@@ o drama .
what ?
who 's our film director , kw@@ ang so@@ o ?
who knows ?
has it not been decided yet ?
call anthony and find out .
right now .
who is it ?
who are you dating ?
it 's ...
- it 's ...
- who ?

you ' one night ' vie@@ wers . ( this show )
hello ?

director go@@ o ?
yes , you piece of tras@@ h .
did you read the script ?
shut up , you dog !
please calm down ... no matter how much i think about it , i 'm too pissed off to calm down .
why did you just bring me such an impres@@ sive script now !
are you listening to what i 'm saying ?
you rot@@ ton excuse of a human being .
yes , i 'm listening .
where are you right now ? i 'll be there as soon as the sun 's up tomorrow , so you all better be prepared !
what is going on that we 're meeting so early ?
i 'm a bit worried ...
good morning !

drop the preten@@ se , you punk .
wow , how long has it been ?
why are you so excited ?
this is it , isn 't it ?
stop your fus@@ sing , you punk .
they 're here .
a@@ igo . director !
welcome back , director !
it 's been a very long time !
so you 're the broadcasting director dog now ?
ah , yes .
you 're still the same , director go@@ o .
speaking of which , you 're still here ?
ah , director ... please show me your enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m , just like you did when i first entered the company .
please take good care of the show .
ask that to the rat@@ ing .
both you and i will die or live depen@@ ding on that number .
it 's this way .
this is the place .
writ@@ er lee ?
nice to see you !
hello , director !
hello !
director of photo@@ graphy !
wow , how long has it been !
?
this is the ligh@@ ting manager .
wow ... how long has it been ?
this is the director of photo@@ graphy .
this set is impres@@ sive !
do you think ...
director go@@ o won 't have problems ?
there has to be problems .
par@@ don ?
we suppor@@ ted anthony to get his time s@@ lot and we now have some power ... now , we must take director nam down . wouldn 't it be easy to take director nam down , if his first drama , as the broadcasting director , fa@@ ils ?
how do you feel ?
i 'm so excited !
it makes my heart flut@@ ter that my own script will be made into a real drama !
keep that up with your script , too .
yes , director .
we should have dinner together with the team .
i 'll make a reserv@@ ation at a restaurant near the company .
i 'm already meeting someone tonight .
director go@@ o is a char@@ ming person .
yes , yes he is .
but don 't like him too much .
there 's no such thing as a conflic@@ t@@ less drama , but there 's no such thing as a conflic@@ t@@ less set either .
a@@ igo , director !
how do you do , director ?
i 'm k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i see , you 're hy@@ un min .
ras@@ cal , you are indeed handsome .
please make me look good on camera , too .
okay .
sit down , sit down .
i can 't tell you how glad we are that you are here , director .
i would especially like to talk to you about the genre of noir regar@@ ding this drama .
what are your thoughts on the genre ?
that 's what i like about it .
the fact that it is a fresh genre without the che@@ es@@ y melan@@ chol@@ y .
that 's why it really su@@ ited me .
that 's right .
you 're even good at selec@@ ting a good project ... i see why you 've become such a star , hy@@ un min .
yes . but even though i think that it 's okay , in general wouldn 't it be good to have a little bit of mel@@ o [ drama ] in it ?
don 't pay any attention to that anth@@ on@@ y-@@ like non@@ sense !
no , no , i don 't .
especially the ending scene of episode 1 ... is so full of the genre , it 's aw@@ esome !
exactly !
starting with the ending of episode 1 , we 're going to overwhel@@ m the screen ! hy@@ un min , your sharp eyes and your sculp@@ tured body will be cap@@ tured by 12 camer@@ as , action !
explo@@ de !
jump into the sea !
flames of fire everywhere . sp@@ las@@ hes of water can be heard as you sw@@ im across the tall waves .
close in on the sharp eyes of kim jin wo@@ o , and then ...
cut ! director , this is amazing !
the best scene ever in kore@@ an drama history !
what 's even more impres@@ sive is that we 're doing it for real without computer grap@@ hic@@ s .
g@@ wang so@@ o !
by the way , you do know how to sw@@ im , right ?
of course . i 've been training just in case .
do you know how to sw@@ im in the sea ?
excuse me ? the sea ? even though the weather is not ideal , it 's not winter yet , so the sea should be okay .
you can do it , right ?
eh ?
yes .
very good .
we should do this as we had origin@@ ally planned , - yes .
and if we need more , we can talk later as they come up .
- yes .
you go and show him .
what ?
you should look at this .
director go@@ o said to re@@ do the budget for episode 1 according to this ...
where is director go@@ o now ? five years is a long time , but " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has given me hope out of that desp@@ air . i , go@@ o young mo@@ k , will treat it as if it were my last drama , and leave my old , id@@ le ways of life and pa@@ the@@ tic attitude behind .
i will put my very best into this project ! there@@ fore , this project will be shot at a huge scale to match the qu@@ ality it de@@ serv@@ es , and we have a long , ar@@ du@@ ous journey ahead of us .
everybody , are you ready ?
!
yes !
though it 's not alcohol , let 's have a to@@ ast .
for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ! "
che@@ ers !
oh , represent@@ ative kim , good to see you .
have a seat . before that , let 's talk outside .
what ?
what do you want to say ?
what is this ?
what about this ?
you 're asking why ? twelve camer@@ as , a helicop@@ ter , 1,200 ex@@ tras , the cost@@ s for ac@@ tors , costum@@ es , and food for film@@ ing for 5 days , and even an explo@@ ding cru@@ ise !
you want to spend over a 1 bil@@ lion won ( ~ $ 1@@ million ) for just the last 5 minutes of episode 1 , are you for real ?
yeah , and so ?
what about it ?
there 's no way we can do that .
can 't do it ?
yes , can 't do it .
i want to pour every last drop of my passion into this , why can 't we do it ?
! why should i burn my money to fu@@ el your passion , director ?
this is the most important scene of this drama ! even so , over a bil@@ lion won for just 5 minutes is too much . i 'm prepar@@ ing a team that can work with a reason@@ able budget , so work something out with them .
and if i can 't do that ?
then i will be forced to use my last res@@ ort .
what 's that ?
you 're saying you will fire me ?
if you won 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
don 't play around .
you may be the one who brought me on board , but you can 't kick me off so easily .
that sounds fun .
oh it would be very fun .
really , what 's your personal problem ?
if people don 't do what you want , you thre@@ aten to fire them .
if you don 't know , but out since it 's not your concern .
represent@@ ative !
find another director .
i already told you .
there is no one else .
find one !
even if you have to search the whole country , or the whole world !
if there isn 't anyone , cre@@ ate someone !
yes , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
where ?
has it been 3 years ? enough with the formal@@ ities , you 're the represent@@ ative of the empire production .
but who is it this time ?
the one you want to te@@ ach a les@@ son ?
it 's someone you also know very well .
if it 's someone i know very well , who is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
actor k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
i 'm coun@@ ting on your help .
just like when you helped with bringing down anthony with the media re@@ ports 3 years ago .
just like bringing down anthony 3 years ago , huh ?
any@@ how , why is k@@ ang hy@@ un min your target ?
if i can 't cut off the head of the enemy , i shall cut off his hand that wiel@@ ds the sword .
me , go in the sea ?
even in the winter ?
does this make any sense ?
what kind of a director is he ?
he needs to learn to respect his ac@@ tors .
what if , while shooting the ending of episode 1 , something goes wrong like that ?
what about the rest of the drama ? i 'm ir@@ re@@ pl@@ ace@@ able for this whole business !
writ@@ er , are you listening to what i 'm saying ?
well , can 't you just go along and do it ?
no way ! they want to dun@@ k me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , the super@@ star , into the cold winter sea !
just do it ?
do you even know what the sea temperature is today ?
i even looked it up .
it 's 6@@ º@@ c ( 43@@ º@@ f ) !
six de@@ gre@@ es ! i can 't do this .
no , i choose not to !
you call yourself an actor , but the reason why you won 't do it is because it 's cold ?
yes , it 's because it 's cold !
i can toler@@ ate a lot of things , but not cold !
never !
su@@ ck it up !
i refuse to su@@ ck it up .
cut out that ending scene of episode 1 .
what 's that ?
or fix it so i won 't have to sw@@ im .
i 've got plenty of other min@@ d-@@ w@@ rec@@ king things right now , do you have to add to that , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
you promised .
that you would write for me .
how is that promise relat@@ ed to this issue ?
no matter what , i won 't go in the sea . either , talk director go@@ o out of it , or change the script .
i 'm leaving .
you 're impl@@ ying you 'll fire me ?
if you don 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
what is this ?
this is the budget list of episode 1 based on the w@@ ishes of director go@@ o .
and so ?
so ? !
it can 't be produc@@ ed this way !
i 'm going to change the director .
have you tried reason@@ ing ?
he 's very stub@@ born .
isn 't persu@@ as@@ ion one of the skil@@ ls of a produc@@ er ?
right ? if persu@@ as@@ ion doesn 't work , then you should incre@@ ase the budget .
so you 're a person without s@@ kill , produc@@ er kim .
in such a circum@@ stance , don 't we have to change the produc@@ er instead of changing the director ?
director !
represent@@ ative kim ...
right now all the direc@@ tors said that they can 't shoot a drama with you .
in such a case , what do you think will be our choice as a broadcasting station ? represent@@ ative kim , if you have no skil@@ ls , quit .
we will sign a contr@@ act with director go@@ o directly and make this drama on our own .
this person ...
writ@@ er lee ...
didn 't director go@@ o contact you perhaps ?
he didn 't .
and the represent@@ ative ?
well , that ... he went to the broadcasting station .
it seems like he 'll tell them that he 's going to fire director go@@ o .
writ@@ er lee ...
taxi !
you can come in .
you were looking for me ?
ah , yes .
yes , director nam .
about " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... " there is a possibil@@ ity that we will be produc@@ ing it our@@ selves , so please make prepar@@ ations for that .
but ...
in-@@ house production ?
yes .
yes ?
director , someone is here to see you .
okay .
oh , writ@@ er lee .
how ... is the scrip@@ t-@@ writing going well ?
yes .
as you may know , there is a bit of a problem between director go@@ o and represent@@ ative kim .
but you just need to focus on writing , writ@@ er lee .
i came because i heard that our represent@@ ative was here .
yes . you 'll have heard of it , our represent@@ ative and director go@@ o , neither of them are willing to give way .
it would be good if you could medi@@ ate between them .
please do us the fav@@ our . well , i gave a final notice to represent@@ ative kim and since you will find it out soon , i 'll tell you what 's going on .
if produc@@ er kim can 't clear up this situation , we have no choice but to produce " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " our@@ selves at s@@ bc .
in-@@ house production ?
yes , in-@@ house production .
so , that means world production will be exclu@@ ded from the production team .
do you really ... have to go this far ?
ah , nothing about your role will change , so please don 't worry too much .
i 'm sorry , but i think produc@@ ing the drama through world production is the right choice .
but , why are you on represent@@ ative kim 's side ?
are you trying to rep@@ ay him for rein@@ stat@@ ing you as the writ@@ er ?
huh ?
represent@@ ative kim rein@@ stat@@ ed me ... ?
what are you going to do now ?
i heard it from the director himself .
he said if it 's not director go@@ o they are going for in-@@ house production .
it 's not for you to inter@@ fere .
so are you going to pull out of the production ?
that 's not for you to worry about either .
i 'm asking because i 'm curious how you 're feeling .
you fired people whom you don 't like , but now you 're in the other side 's situation .
so i 'm wondering how you feel , probably it f * * * ing su@@ cks .
it feels dirty and pa@@ the@@ tic , right ?
that 's why people hate you .
don 't concern yourself .
that 's why there is no one left at your side .
i don 't need those bastar@@ ds .
but you said you wanted to make a succes@@ s@@ ful come@@ back .
to make that succes@@ s last long , you must not lose people . you don 't have any power now , not like when you were in empire .
what , are the things i said not correct ?
am i not correct ? that 's right . making this drama succes@@ s@@ ful and taking the re@@ ward from it for my come@@ back is the purpose of all of these .
and av@@ eng@@ ing on those people who took away my position and tr@@ amp@@ led on my power is the reason .
are they all like that ?
people born and raised in weal@@ thy hom@@ es and privil@@ ed@@ ged environ@@ ments ?
are they all like you ?
why can 't you just accept the reality of having fallen to the ground ?
is res@@ ent@@ ing the world your only option ?
so ? did i do anything wrong ? you , why on earth did you end up making dram@@ as ?
there 's no such non@@ sense as a reason .
you ... why on earth did you end up making dram@@ as ?
you jer@@ k , what did you say !
?
if you call me a fa@@ ther@@ less son of a b ... once more and you keep pr@@ att@@ ling on about my mother not being able to see , i 'll kill you !
what kind of kid is taught that ?
since you 're blind , i can 't tell you to look ( at my son 's face ) .
what are you going to do about my son 's face ?
!
i am sorry .
it 's my fault , because i 'm so l@@ acking .
why are you not apologi@@ z@@ ing ?
i didn 't do anything wrong .
what ?
i 'm spe@@ ech@@ less !
i 'm going to report you to the police !
the likes of this one should eat be@@ any rice .
e@@ un se@@ ok 's mother !
e@@ un se@@ ok 's mother ?
mother .
the exper@@ t already confir@@ med it .
this suicide doesn 't make sense ...
[ " the head of detec@@ tives " - a famous kore@@ an cop series in 1971 ~ 1989 . ]
the test res@@ ult came out .
stat@@ ure , age , blood type , they all did not match .
- what about the finger@@ prin@@ ts ?
- well ...
pay attention to the ... good job , you 're doing well .
did you find director go@@ o ?
yes , he 's in the bon@@ g@@ che@@ on@@ dong neighbor@@ hood .
i 'll send you his location .
if you don 't change your mind , then , yes , i 'll fire you .
give me a bottle of so@@ ju , please .
yes .
what business do you have here ?
are you going back to your cott@@ age ?
get lost .
you bastard , what the he@@ ck are you doing !
?
all in all , 1.@@ 05 bil@@ lion won .
this is the money you need to shoot the final scene of 5 minutes you want to shoot .
what game are you playing ?
!
those 5 minutes ... shoot them .
in exchange i 'll ask you one thing .
what is this drama to you ?
nothing will change . " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sang " is my last drama !
it 's not .
it 's the foundation for the next 10 years of your career .
i don 't care about your swe@@ et-@@ tal@@ ks about the future !
each episode is 60 minutes , so 1200 minutes in total . spen@@ ding 1 bil@@ lion on 5 minutes makes the remain@@ ing 119@@ 5 minutes a stret@@ ch .
no , this way your future 10 years dis@@ appear . for those moment@@ ary five minutes , please don 't throw away your glor@@ ious 10 years .
and five years ago don 't forget the day when you hit rock bottom .
hey you crazy bastard !
stop !
if i give up on those five minutes , what are you going to give me ?
the 5 lost years that you want to forget i will turn them into the joy of succes@@ s .
cle@@ an@@ ly , without a trace . hey punk ,
i told you to throw that blu@@ ff away first .
if it 's a blu@@ ff or not , you will see when the time comes .
director , about that director go@@ o and anthony ...
what about anthony ? director , about that director go@@ o and anthony ... what about anthony ?
well , looks like anthony has worked the kin@@ ks out with director go@@ o , so everything is in working order now ! in working order ?
yes !
sounded like anthony was able to persu@@ ade director go@@ o .
it seems like ... anthony has changed some@@ what .. he 's a different man now ...
what a strange world . alright , i see ... director go@@ o , huh ?
alright .
- see you .
what ?
really ?
yes , i decided to cur@@ b down my amb@@ itions . that is a great decision , director !
but what made you change your mind ? nothing special , it 's just 5 minutes , not worth throwing out 10 years ' worth of glory .
wow , i 'm so im@@ pressed !
im@@ pressed ?
whatever .
once you have enough experience , you 'll become more sensible , too , writ@@ er lee .
at any rate , i heard that hy@@ un min refus@@ es to do it ?
yes , he says sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea is too dangerous and difficult for him .
he asked me to change the script if we couldn 't change your mind .
okay .
so it 's too much for hy@@ un min , huh ?
what time is the ap@@ pointment with hy@@ un min ?
i 'll get to the point right away with director go@@ o , and you need to ch@@ ime in right then .
i got it .
you have to stand your ground . be firm .
got it ?
i said i understood .
let 's go , sparta .
get that thing ready , please .
yes , i see .
director , i heard that you like to drink .
so we prepared a special gift for you .
i stopped drinking .
excuse me ?
oh , we didn 't know .... well then , instead of wine ... nah , it 's ok .
as long as i don 't drink . here i 'll pour you a glass .
yes .
director .
about the ending scene of episode 1 , the way i see it , there is something that bo@@ thers me .
we 're thinking that the scale is rather un@@ re@@ alist@@ ic ...
what do you think ?
i agree .
i was a bit over@@ ly excited about that .
that 's right , director !
it was over@@ ly un@@ re@@ alist@@ ic , indeed !
no@@ wad@@ ays , the computer@@ graphic technology is so advanced , you can just do that .
you can just shoot it in an artific@@ ial pool , there 's no need to do it in real sea water .
that 's so old fashi@@ oned .
that 's not what i mean .
i meant that my amb@@ itions went over our budget .
what ?
then , how are we doing that scene ?
even if we turn down the scale , we should still film at sea .
um , director , what do you mean by that ?
no matter what , we 've got to shoot k@@ ang hy@@ un min sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea .
forget the clo@@ wn that just poses in front of the camera for good looks , we 're going to turn you into a serious actor with a ten@@ ac@@ ious passion .
how about it ?
don 't you want to stop being a clo@@ wn and start becoming a real actor ?
no .
i can@@ not accept that .
hy@@ un , hy@@ un min !
the wil@@ der the dog , once tam@@ ed , turns into something great .
give me just a moment , director .
hy@@ ung , how did it go ?
you don 't know ?
tell them they won 't see me until they get this thing sor@@ ted out !
huh ?
stop !
hey !
stop !
you can 't just storm out like this !
come back in , let 's talk to the director ... even if i die i 'm not going back in , so shut the door and get lost !
alright , then .
you 're not getting out ?
i can 't get out .
if you don 't get off , i won 't get out either even if i die .
they just took off .
yes .
i also saw with my own eyes that he had a drink .
okay .
i understand . you 've worked hard .
get started with our arrang@@ ements .
yes , i understand .
i heard that you and director go@@ o have reached an agreement .
yes .
that 's a relief .
were you sin@@ cere in saying it 's a relief ? i 'm just dying to know , how did you do it ?
do what ?
neither director go@@ o nor you , represent@@ ative kim , are known for comprom@@ ising their positions .
i made a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
i don 't think i 'm oblig@@ ed to di@@ vul@@ ge that information to you .
what ?
!
" a clo@@ wn that poses in front of the camera for a few good looking sho@@ ts " ?
" turn me into a real actor " ?
how dare he say that to me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
don 't you agree ?
!
why couldn 't he say that ?
what ?
!
don 't even think about going back and hiding in a pen@@ sion in yang@@ p@@ ye@@ ong to play video games .
turn the car around .
get out .
i know you don 't really have anywhere else to go .
why are you like this ?
!
you 're like a kid wh@@ in@@ ing to his mom whenever something goes wrong .
why wouldn 't i have anywhere to go ?
then where ?
where would you go ?
i 'll go see my mom !
what ? ou@@ ch !
man , everything is just driving me crazy !
a@@ igo , what do i do ?
!
ais@@ h , dar@@ n it !
shouldn 't we get out ?
oh , are you alright ?
i 'm really sorry .
why do something that 'll make you sorry ?
let the insur@@ ance company take care of it .
ah yes , we shall do that .
oh , by the way , aren 't you k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
never mind . just give me your contact in@@ fo .
of course .
man , what a has@@ s@@ le !
what is going on ?
just a fen@@ der-@@ ben@@ der . i re@@ ar-@@ ended his car .
oh , is that so ?
have you reached an agreement ?
yes , yes .
ah , but i think he has been drinking .
drinking ? sun@@ ba@@ e-@@ n@@ im , i 'm sure your project 's going well .
thanks to you .
i haven 't done anything .
it 's all thanks to your skil@@ ls .
what is it ?
bad news .
what bad news ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min just got caught for drunk driving .
his blood@@ -@@ alcohol content is enough to get his license suspen@@ ded .
where are you ?
ah , where is this ?
hello ?
hello , lee go e@@ un ?
say something , lee go e@@ un !
pre@@ view
tell me ! how did this happen ? if we let k@@ ang hy@@ un min res@@ ume his role , the public will critic@@ ize our whole broadcasting station .
shouldn 't you partner up with someone more trust@@ able ?
let 's re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min with a different actor .
i heard that writ@@ er lee go e@@ un isn 't doing so well , either , so both writ@@ er and actor should be re@@ placed .
i 'm just asking for some time !
car@@ zy dog , we need song bit na . absolutely .
i think everything was a set up , not a coinci@@ dence .
oh jin wan .
ah , you 're fir@@ ing me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
if we don 't get this worked out in three days , we 're do@@ omed !
ah , i don 't know , i don 't know i 'm going crazy !
the only person who can sol@@ ve this problem is your mother .
you know , my tum@@ my aches too much , doctor .
she doesn 't have any exter@@ nal in@@ jur@@ ies or any special symp@@ tom@@ s , why hasn 't she wo@@ ken up yet ?
the question is .. whether there is brain damage .
who are you ?
do ... i know that person , too ?
why do you not know me ?
you absolutely must remember me !
even if you have to use the power of hat@@ red , just remember me , lee go e@@ un !
episode 7 as@@ ph@@ alt g@@ ladi@@ ator out@@ patient reception ad@@ mission@@ d@@ isch@@ ar@@ ge proto@@ col@@ s come to your senses , lee go e@@ un !
tell me ! how did this happen ? !
while the cops caught me for drunk driving , she was on the phone , and then ... it all happened so quickly . go e@@ un ! - go e@@ un !
- wait , we have to get her to a scan@@ ner right away .
go e@@ un , why ?
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
how did this happen ?
why is my kid lying there un@@ conscious ?
answer me !
i 'm sorry . if by any chance , something happens to my child , i am really going to kill you !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
go e@@ un !
- there he is !
- he 's here !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
what is your take on the situation ?
please , even a sent@@ ence will do !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , would you please explain your drunk driving charge ?
is it true that you were fully drunk , and that your license is suspen@@ ded ?
what kind of effec@@ ts do you fore@@ see on your acting career ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min drinking and driving can he do the drama ?
how in the world can he drive while drunk right before his new drama is about to start ?
if we let k@@ ang hy@@ un min keep his role , the whole public might critic@@ ize our broadcasting station .
well , so ... what does the chief produc@@ er in charge think ?
since shooting hasn 't even started yet , i don 't think we need the risk of such a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al actor ...
so you want to cut him off ?
! yes , if you do something wrong , you should be pun@@ ished for it , but you don 't want to over@@ do the pun@@ ishment to the ex@@ tent of killing k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's life as an actor !
he 's done it to himself !
so , just because the media is critic@@ iz@@ ing him , you want to jump on the wagon and end his career , too ?
i can@@ not abandon my actor like that !
re@@ place the actor ?
let 's re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min with a different actor .
director !
it doesn 't make sense to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min when the public senti@@ ment is in such an u@@ pro@@ ar .
plus , it 's not just my personal opinion , but the whole drama department 's opinion .
i can 't do that .
is it because of the contr@@ act fee that you 've paid him in advan@@ ce ?
we can 't take the risk of his ru@@ ined reputation affec@@ ting our business just to ac@@ commo@@ date your financial situation .
i 've also heard that writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is not doing well , either .
i think it 's better to re@@ place both the writ@@ er and actor this time .
please , give me some time .
re@@ place them at once .
please , give me some time .
represent@@ ative kim !
just give me some time !
three days .
three days .
resol@@ ve all this in 3 days .
if you don 't resol@@ ve this in 3 days , no matter how much financial loss may in@@ cu@@ r , we re@@ place them both .
there 's no way that anthony would want to re@@ place k@@ ang hy@@ un min and for@@ fe@@ it the 2 bil@@ lion won he paid him .
besides , there 's no other actor to re@@ place him with .
more@@ over , the writ@@ er is in a coma . in short , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is beyond re@@ pair at this point .
so , what is it you want ?
if " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is a no go , wouldn 't the empire 's " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " be a good su@@ b for it ?
i know very well that you had lent anthony a hand , assistant director .
forgive me for saying this , but why don 't you len@@ d that hand to someone more reli@@ able ?
someone who can really be a big help when you 're in need .
look at them all .
such vul@@ tures .
they don 't care about the person who got in@@ ju@@ red , but only about k@@ ang hy@@ un min if he 's coming or not .
how heart@@ less they are !
at any rate , i hope writ@@ er lee wak@@ es up from her coma .
what a dis@@ aster this is .
what is the problem ?
she doesn 't have any serious exter@@ nal in@@ jur@@ ies or odd symp@@ tom@@ s .
why isn 't she up yet ?
the question is whether there is any brain damage .
once we take a look at her brain scan@@ s , we 'll have more information , but at this point , it 's hard to say .
what are you so excited about ?
well , we 're really getting started with the project now !
i know very well that the fate of not just me and you , but everybody involved with this drama depen@@ ds on the cho@@ ices i make .
that 's why i can 't give up .
we 'll have victory for sure !
are you sure ?
what per@@ cent@@ age is your confidence rat@@ ing ?
you always said to me , " believe me . "
this time , it 's your turn to believe me , represent@@ ative .
i 'll stay here , so you guys can go back to work .
no , we 'll wait here , too , until she wak@@ es up .
yeah , even if i tried to work , i don 't think i 'll be able to focus on it .
are we going to collap@@ se here ?
are we going to collap@@ se , throwing a fit like a wh@@ in@@ y kid ?
lee go e@@ un will wake up .
absolutely .
get back to work so that we can start shooting with her script right away .
yes .
thank you .
what is it ?
what is it that you have to say ?
about the drunk driving incident of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ....
actually ...
-@@ represent@@ ative !
i found it .
the first news report of k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's drunk driving charge was written by reporter park se@@ ong bo@@ k of da@@ e@@ han daily .
what , park se@@ ong bo@@ k ?
yes .
the same reporter who had written that cal@@ um@@ ni@@ ous report about the death of the deli@@ very man 3 years ago .
it was also reporter park who re@@ ar-@@ ended k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's car .
i think it was all a sch@@ eme , not a coinci@@ dence .
oh jin wan !
where are you going ?
you can 't go in !
represent@@ ative ... please leave .
move out the way , unless you wish to die .
didn 't i war@@ n you that i was going to win this ...
are you crazy ?
you want to be su@@ ed ?
then do it .
oh jin wan , i 'm warning you !
you can do anything to me , but you can 't touch my actor , my writ@@ er , my people .
since when did anthony , to whom the end justif@@ ied any means , become an ad@@ voc@@ ate of justice ?
i learned it all from you .
in order to get what i want , i have to be col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded and mer@@ cil@@ ess , ext@@ ingu@@ ishing every last ray of hope !
then , here 's another les@@ son for you !
a death match is only between g@@ ladi@@ ators .
pd jo@@ o ?
represent@@ ative , i 'm calling to in@@ form you about lee go e@@ un .
deput@@ y director ... it 's me .
what i told you to do , i think you should hurry up and proce@@ ed with it .
immediately .
represent@@ ative !
what ?
the ct , did it come out okay ?
um , about that ... she woke up , but ... lee go e@@ un , are you okay ?
who are you ?
do i know him as well ?
you really don 't know me ?
i 'm not sure .
why don 't you know me ?
i am anthony .
anthony who buried you in this field 3 years ago after only using you , and later threw you away again without mercy ! it 's me , anthony !
do you even forget your hat@@ red and res@@ ent@@ ment towards me ?
this can 't be .
you must remember me .
even if you have to use the power of hat@@ red you must remember me , lee go e@@ un !
so you do know that .
how mean you have been to me !
always you were the one who tr@@ icked people , but now how do you feel being fool@@ ed ?
do you think i fell for such a cl@@ um@@ sy act of yours ?
i 'm sorry but i have been produc@@ ing dram@@ as for the last 10 years .
i have used the " am@@ n@@ esia " p@@ lot more than 100 times .
and also , you ... were the worst among all of the am@@ n@@ esia acting i 've seen .
so if you have time to make this kind of pet@@ ty joke , use that time to write scrip@@ ts !
pd jo@@ o already brought me my lap@@ top anyway !
hey , go e@@ un ! i brought your favorite , gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ el ....
you 're here ?
pd jo@@ o , make sure writ@@ er lee gets everything she needs .
yes .
by the way , you totally fell for it earlier , didn 't you ?
i have never seen you being like that before , represent@@ ative .
so ... you mean " eleg@@ ant reven@@ ge 2 " of empire production ?
well ...
it 's not easy to find a top actor who is avail@@ able for shooting now . and more@@ over ,
empire production has finished its se@@ t-@@ up for shooting with the casting of kim jin wo@@ o .
kim jin wo@@ o ?
right now ?
that 's why it 's empire production , isn 't it ?
even if we wait one or two days more , it 's not like any great option will suddenly pop up .
director nam , let 's proce@@ ed ( with empire ) right away , no need to wait more ( for world ) . but as it was a promise i gave as director , let 's wait just for 3 days .
if there is no change after 3 days , i will re@@ consider the project . since writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is conscious now , i 'm very relieved then ..
i really dr@@ ank just one shot , but a license suspension ? those articles are all lies !
that breath@@ aly@@ zer was obviously manipul@@ ated !
it 's not the time to wh@@ ine that you 're w@@ ron@@ ged !
wh@@ ine ?
represent@@ ative ... if even you are tre@@ ating me like this ...
do you know why you were cast@@ ed ?
because you 're good at acting ?
because i like you person@@ ally ?
no , it was because the station would give me the broadcasting sched@@ ule if i brought you .
but because of your reck@@ less behavi@@ or , we 're now in a crisis and there is no other actor to immediately re@@ place you either .
if we don 't sol@@ ve this issue within three days , all of us are finished !
what do you mean " finished " ?
is it decided at the broadcasting station ?
me ?
you will fire me ?
me , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
what ... should we do now ?
did you request the blood test ?
yes , but ...
i 'm not sure its res@@ ult from national for@@ en@@ sic service will come out within three days .
hy@@ ung ... it 's bit na , but she says your cell phone is turned off so ...
tell her i 'll call later .
then , what are you doing for media play ?
that 's , well ...
hy@@ ung ... it 's your mother ... oh my god , seriously !
mom !
how many times have i told you that i can 't come to you ? right now , there are tons of repor@@ ters waiting in front of my house , to bury your son , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , alive !
mom !
do you think your stom@@ ach@@ ache is a big deal now ?
aren 't you watching tv , mom ?
right at the moment when you had a stom@@ ach@@ ache and went to the er , i had a big accident , too !
i don 't know .
i 'm going crazy .
let 's talk later , bye !
watch your language to your mother !
she 's my mom , but she doesn 't even have a clue what happened to her son .
she 's nag@@ ging why i 'm not visit@@ ing her when she has a stom@@ ach@@ ache .
then , you should visit her !
huh ?
the only person who will resol@@ ve this situation is your mom .
well , from now on , our new script will begin .
hy@@ un min , you should lower your head as much as possible .
represent@@ ative choi and kw@@ ang so@@ o , you guys make a way for hy@@ un min , with the sin@@ cere mind to help him visit@@ ing his sick mother quickly .
hy@@ un min 's mother had a little bit of stom@@ ach@@ ache and went to er around at 6@@ pm yesterday .
she 's goes to the er so often just like she would visit her sp@@ a for a mas@@ sage .
so the doc@@ tors get so frustr@@ ated when they see my mom 's name .
yes .
she came again ? that 's because when they look at her , she looks too fine .
so , can you tell me which pain brought you here again ?
the stomach .
my stomach really hur@@ ts , doctor .
but last night , to run to your sick mother at er , you had no choice but to drive . but , yesterday , hy@@ un min 's mother left the er at 7 pm .
and the time of my accident was later than 8@@ pm .
that 's why we should make a story .
hy@@ un min got a phone call before that and ran to the hospital !
mom left the hospital with a doctor 's fac@@ ile pres@@ cription .
but then , bam !
there was an accident .
then , today ?
hy@@ un min 's mother 's symp@@ tom , which wasn 't serious yesterday , became serious today !
hy@@ un min ...
yes .
you and i , the fate of us is all depen@@ ds on your mother 's acting today .
where do you feel the pain ?
ma '@@ am , where is your pain , tell me !
bring doc@@ tors !
bring doc@@ tors !
it hur@@ ts , hur@@ ts , hur@@ ts !
for now , take ct scan@@ s !
yes .
ma '@@ am ?
oh , my tum@@ my !
aig@@ oo !
mom ! mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min had an accident on his way here yesterday , so he couldn 't come so@@ oner .
i heard that she compl@@ ained about serious stomach pain yesterday , too .
uh .... yes , yes , yes .
then , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i last night was because of an emergen@@ cy with his mother 's health ?
then , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i last night was because of an emergen@@ cy with his mother 's health ? why didn 't he explain that so@@ oner ?
listen , people , this is a hospital .
con@@ tain your@@ selves .
does the mother of k@@ r . k@@ ang hy@@ un min know , too ?
we 're waiting for the lab resul@@ ts cur@@ r@@ ently .
do you have any predic@@ tions about her diagno@@ sis ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min will have a press conference to answer all these questions .
please leave now .
this sm@@ ells f@@ ish@@ y ...
f@@ ish@@ y ?
when is k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's press conference ?
this coming friday .
no one must know about our plan .
there@@ fore , make sure that your mother , represent@@ ative choi , and g@@ wang so@@ o all zip it up .
yes .
we must keep this secret especially from lee go e@@ un , who 'll write your ap@@ ology to be read at the conference .
even from writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
but she 's one of us , though ?
she is one of us , but she can 't be one of us when we 're lying .
what do you think she 'd do if she found out about our dis@@ honest plan ?
i got it .
at times , the enemy within us can do the most damage .
never , never must she know !
the mother of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min is ill ?
last night , she couldn 't keep anything down even .
her stomach was in such a pain ... then , when you said that you were going to see your mother ... you were being serious ?
i know you don 't have anywhere else to go , why are you being like this ?
you 're like a kid wh@@ in@@ ing to his mom when something goes wrong !
why wouldn 't i have anywhere else to go ?
where ?
where are you going ?
i 'm going to see my mom !
happy ?
that 's right .
i 'm so sorry , i didn 't know ...
i understand .
i 'm sorry for not even contac@@ ting you when you woke up .
i had no idea that k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother was ill .
at least the media re@@ ports are sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic toward k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
what a relief .
great relief indeed , now that writ@@ er lee is also reco@@ vering sw@@ if@@ tly .
at any rate , that bastard represent@@ ative oh has reserv@@ ed a spot in hell .
att@@ acking k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's career with the du@@ i charge was all his doing .
man , the bad karma between our represent@@ ative kim and represent@@ ative oh ...
could it be that they were a married couple in their previ@@ ous life ?
why else would they be such enem@@ ies ?
why have you been ignoring my calls ?
is there someone beside you ?
no .
it 's okay now .
i 'd like you to find out one more thing .
see if the mother of k@@ ang hy@@ un min is really ill .
do you really have to go this far ?
what 's wrong with you ?
are you getting cold feet now ?
writ@@ er lee could have been seriously in@@ ju@@ red !
why do you think i planned this whole thing with k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i ?
my target is anthony .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i was just one of the means to get to that end .
lee go e@@ un is just an un@@ expected , un@@ fortun@@ ate casu@@ al@@ ty .
i don 't care who gets hurt and whose career gets ru@@ ined .
whatever you say , i can 't .... if something goes wrong , do you think you 'll be safe ?
if i expose that you were my m@@ ole , your career in this field will be totally over .
think of your fr@@ ail grandmother . unless you want to spend the rest of your life penn@@ il@@ ess and jo@@ bl@@ ess , and end up watching hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly as your grandmother passes away , and end up watching hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly as your grandmother passes away , do as i say .
do you really think anthony made it up ?
we shall find out soon enough . the moment the truth comes out that k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother was fak@@ ing her health problems , the du@@ i charge will be nothing compar@@ ed to that . it won 't be just k@@ ang hy@@ un min that falls , but anthony as well will be do@@ omed forever beyond hope in this field .
it 's not like i commit@@ ted a serious crime , why do i have to do this ?
reg@@ ard@@ less of the circum@@ stances , you did drink and drive .
you 've betr@@ ayed the trust of the public that have loved you , and you 've hurt their feelings .
this is not just for show .
unless you sin@@ cer@@ ely rep@@ ent , this whole thing is point@@ less !
did i ever ask them to love me ?
they just fell head over heels for me because i 'm so hot !
yes , you 're hot .
so you can also make a hot ap@@ ology .
unless you want to ru@@ in your career .
alright .
happy ?
happy about what ?
you need to practice .
practice until it hur@@ ts .
i am only what i am thanks to the love i rece@@ ive from the public , and i express my de@@ ep@@ est reg@@ re@@ ts for betr@@ aying the trust of so many fans ... wait , i think you should pause for a moment after " betr@@ aying the trust . "
i think you should lower your gaze slightly before moving on to the next words .
i am only what i am thanks to the love i rece@@ ive from the public , and i express my de@@ ep@@ est reg@@ re@@ ts for betr@@ aying the trust of so many fans .
good . next .
i do not want to try to justif@@ y my actions of that day with my personal circum@@ stances ...
that 's not it .
you have to show a surge of emotions .
think of your mom and pause .
... with my personal circum@@ stances .
nah , too weak .
go again !
i will accept all critic@@ is@@ ms for my actions and use them to drive myself to become a better person .
h@@ mm .
good .
par@@ don ?
you think it was stag@@ ed ?
well , i wouldn 't put it past anthony if he 's desperate enough .
listen , what if anthony just wanted to calm down the public senti@@ ment by stag@@ ing a health issue with k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother who is not sick at all ?
more@@ over , what if the truth came out ?
this would certainly harm the reputation of our station !
yes , i understand .
however , i don 't think we should make a hast@@ y decision about this . think about it , if , as you say , the truth were to come out , k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's career would be most affec@@ ted , right ?
would k@@ ang hy@@ un min really gamb@@ le his whole career like that ?
listen , director nam . the actor 's career depen@@ ds on the impression the public has of him .
there 's nothing he couldn 't do to re@@ store his ru@@ ined reputation .
alright , i see .
if , as you say , assistant director , the issue turns out to be stag@@ ed , then ... i will take away the broadcasting s@@ lot from " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
got it ? when ans@@ wering questions about your mother , don 't hesit@@ ate .
you 'll look more dej@@ ec@@ ted . still ,
i think we need to be clear about the issue with my mom .
absolutely not .
too much water dro@@ wns the miller .
who 's going to dro@@ wn ? mom did go to the er that day , and she 's in the hospital . mom did go to the er that day , and she 's in the hospital .
listen carefully .
if people find out that your mother is a f@@ ake patient , everything is over .
it will be totally over for you and me both , forever .
make no mist@@ akes .
the fate of you , me , and our drama depen@@ ds on today .
fate ?
yes , represent@@ ative .
was i right ?
i was right .
did you record their conversation as i told you to ?
yes .
good . send me a copy of that file , and i 'll text you director heo 's phone number , so send him a copy , too .
you still remember ... what i told you , right ?
if you want to live , just do as i say .
represent@@ ative !
what is it ?
i have something to tell you .
say it .
just a moment , can we talk privat@@ ely ?
since we 're busy now , let 's talk later .
this is the cell number of director heo .
ah , yes .
yes , yes ....
yes .
the blood test res@@ ult of hy@@ un min came out .
it 's 0.@@ 04 and lower than the lim@@ it !
okay .
now , we just need to finish this press conference well .
oh , thank you jesus !
are you ready ?
let 's go .
i , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , have lived getting gener@@ ous love from all the people for the last several years .
yes , represent@@ ative .
why has that file not been sent yet ?
that was ... because my cell phone wasn 't fully char@@ ged until now .
i will send you that file now . if someone has too many thoughts , he lo@@ ses many things as well , you know . you know what i mean , don 't you ?
in ad@@ dition , for all the diffic@@ ulti@@ es the production team of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " had to go through because of me , i 'm giving my sin@@ cere ap@@ ology to them .
so i drove the car myself .
[ voice message ]
[ voice message ] however , about my personal situation , i don 't want to make any exc@@ uses .
writ@@ er lee could 've been in a really dangerous situation .
why do you think i planned k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i ?
my target is anthony .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's du@@ i case is just one of all means to hit that target .
lee go e@@ un was just an un@@ expected , s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at .
i don 't care who gets hurt , or who would be do@@ omed .
wo@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae , this bastard !
i don 't care .
this is the cell number of director heo .
what were you trying to say ?
i 'm sorry , represent@@ ative .
i got it .
in return , you do only what i tell you to do .
stop !
writ@@ er lee could 've been really in a danger .
represent@@ itive !
anthony !
in a press conference which is being ai@@ red live , a re@@ pres@@ n@@ tat@@ ive of a top-@@ class drama production company reve@@ als his own dirty trick to the nation himself . it could 've been a fun show , but luc@@ kil@@ y you stopped it . with that file , what are you going to do ?
that depen@@ ds on how you be@@ have from now on .
if you keep dig@@ ging into hy@@ un min 's mother 's case , i will reve@@ al this file .
then , the public will critic@@ ize you , and cha@@ ir@@ man will fire you who ru@@ ins the reputation of the company , just like he did fire me 3 years ago .
are you saying to make a deal with me ?
so you 're not as dum@@ b as i thought .
oh , and one more .
through all medias you 're de@@ aling with , friendly opin@@ ions about hy@@ un min will be poured out .
now , the combat between g@@ ladi@@ ators is finished . i will go back to the col@@ os@@ se@@ um and enjoy my victory , so you 'd better hurry up . however , based on all the critic@@ ism and ad@@ vice you 've given me ,
we will finish our press conference now .
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
are you okay ?
how was i ?
was i good ?
the best .
you were b@@ ada * * ! especially when you lowered your head for a moment , then , as you continued to talk , with tears ... ! it was art !
of course !
i had especially worked on that part .
have a seat !
where is anthony , anyway ?
what is the reaction of the repor@@ ters ?
much better than i had expected .
they 're already rele@@ asing sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic news re@@ ports .
- ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e !
- but let me make one thing clear .
i swear , i don 't care what kind of a life you lead .
it 's up to you whether you ru@@ in yourself with drug@@ s or gamb@@ le your life away . however , i will not toler@@ ate any mistake from you when you are kim wo@@ o jin of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
what did that lo@@ ony say ?
did you understand him ?
i sure didn 't !
con@@ gr@@ ats !
good job !
well , considering the blood test resul@@ ts and all , i think it 's ok to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min on board .
what do you think ?
it 's too early to tell yet .
what 's important is the public opinion . correct . the numbers may be legal@@ ly accep@@ table , but it 's still true that he drove after drinking alcohol .
i think it would be wise to watch the movement of the public opinion .
yes , - director .
i re@@ vie@@ wed the re@@ actions of the media re@@ ports and the ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s .
yes .
the voice of sym@@ pa@@ thy is deci@@ de@@ dly pre@@ domin@@ ant .
is that so ?
yes .
then , as planned , the november s@@ lot is reserv@@ ed for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " with k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
agreed ?
oh , hy@@ ung , look at this !
scr@@ oll up , up , up , oh , this one !
this one ! oh yes , that 's a good one !
nice shot !
it looks like you were crying .
really crying !
that tear is a real tear .
it 's worth a million dollars .
this is amazing !
take a look at this , director .
our hy@@ un min op@@ pa must have been in so much pain !
the ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s keep post@@ ing comm@@ ents .
hy@@ un min op@@ pa 's big heart is public knowledge .
good .
as you see , the public opinion about k@@ ang hy@@ un min is changed 180 de@@ gre@@ es over@@ night .
right now , ne@@ ti@@ zen@@ s are sig@@ ning pet@@ itions to go against k@@ ang hy@@ un min being fired .
come in .
are you writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
who are you ?
please to meet you .
i 'm hy@@ un min 's mother .
if you 're hy@@ un min 's mother ...
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ... ?
yes .
super@@ star k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother .
you 're still weak , stay sitting !
you 're even more sick than i am ; i can 't stay sitting .
well , i am sick .
even if i 'm a f@@ ake patient .
what are you talking about ?
you know .
flowers ?
yes , director .
we 've decided to go with k@@ ang hy@@ un min as previ@@ ously planned .
i understand .
you don 't seem too happy .
no , i am happy .
very happy .
by any chance , is this what you 've already anticip@@ ated ?
what do you mean ?
no , never@@ mind . then , see you later .
the station 's drama department decided to keep k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
what is that reaction ?
do you have something you haven 't told me ?
something i haven 't told you ?
what ?
what is it ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's mother just came by .
how could you trick me like that ?
it 's fine now that you know .
how can you say something like that ?
if i told you honestly , would you have agreed obe@@ di@@ ently ?
no !
i would never have particip@@ ated in such a far@@ ce !
no , i would 've dis@@ su@@ ade you not to do that !
see !
you 're really im@@ moral .
turning someone 's perfectly fine mother into a seriously ill person in a second wasn 't enough ?
som@@ ed@@ ay , she will be seriously ill , i guess .
for your drama , you 've thrown away your father , now it 's your mother ?
because a husband and a wife are equ@@ al .
get out .
i don 't even want to look at you , so get out !
i 'm busy anyway , so i can 't stay longer .
ah , that devil !
this devil will go back to home to hell now , so you 'd better write the script for episode 6 .
is he crazy or something ?
what do i do ?
hello .
-@@ hello .
what 's that ?
this is the letter he@@ e j@@ ae left .
without saying anything , he said he 's going to re@@ sign for personal reasons .
hey .
what is this ?
to writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ? represent@@ ative , i 'm not brave enough to meet you in person , so i 'm telling you like this .
over that last few months , re@@ pres@@ ant@@ ative , who treated me so well and to the people in world production with an ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic heart , i 'm a sin@@ ner . the fact that i will not rece@@ ive for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess even with any exc@@ uses ,
i know that very well .
so i , somebody pa@@ the@@ tic , will be leaving .
our writ@@ er 's preci@@ ous drama , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
i will pr@@ ay that it will be succes@@ s@@ ful .
be heal@@ thy .
writ@@ er lee !
you 've been well ?
you must still be sick ; you should have told us before you came .
i 'm better now .
you want me to forgive him ?
yes .
i know you 're really disap@@ pointed and angry , but can 't you forgive him ?
no .
a person who betr@@ ays once will betr@@ ay again .
you make a mistake once .
and he@@ e j@@ ae , he 's having a hard time , living with his sick grand@@ ma these days .
that 's why he must have been gre@@ edy from his you@@ th@@ ful passion .
he 's reg@@ ret@@ ting it right now .
what does that have to do with me ?
he 's already fired .
so don 't but@@ t into my business , and you do your work .
why did he get fired ?
actually , i don 't really know myself .
that bastard ... even when i ask , he doesn 't reply .
he doesn 't even pick up his phone anymore .
do you possibly know his address ?
grand@@ ma .
do you possibly know this house , # 30 ?
that 's our house .
we don 't have any coffee mu@@ gs ... no , it 's fine .
this is good too .
by the way , where 's he@@ e j@@ ae ?
he hasn 't come home from work yet .
it 's about time for him to come home .
by the way , didn 't you say you 're working with him ?
oh , i 'm on a vac@@ ation .
it 's so strange today .
a lot of people from work vis@@ ited .
really ?
w@@ h ... who was it ?
they didn 't tell me their name , but ... they said to send this on to him .
ah grand@@ ma , do you mind if i read that ? yes , yes . because of my ey@@ es@@ ight , even if i read it , i wouldn 't know what it was about .
shut up and come to work early , before i really fire you .
grandmother , i 'm here .
writ@@ er lee .
[ lo@@ ony ]
what ?
what are you doing ?
whatever i 'm doing , why do you have to know that ?
just ...
have you re@@ considered about he@@ e j@@ ae ?
that betr@@ ayer will come to work again .
well done .
earlier , he came to me and beg@@ ged me to let him work again , crying over and over .
so , is that the reason you took him back ?
no , i just decided to use him for only three months .
don 't worry about us@@ eless things , and if you have time to make a call , just write scrip@@ ts .
wait a moment .
one more thing .
what else ?
why did you lie ?
are you talking about that again ?
rein@@ stat@@ ing me as a writ@@ er was done by you , not the director of the drama department .
i never did that .
tell me .
why did you lie ? i guess you heard some weird ru@@ mor , but stop talking non@@ sense , and just write more scrip@@ ts .
because i 'm blind , i only see you .
because my heart is frozen , i hug you .
when my trembling lips touch your ears , i say the words i dre@@ amed of ...
good morning !
since i first met you , i love you .
who are you , huh ?
this br@@ at !
huh ?
welcome back !
... those words that came out as tears little by little , fill up my heart as if my heart will explo@@ de with those words .
because both of my eyes are blin@@ ded ,
okay , then let 's go for our other half face , the main female act@@ ress .
yes .
kim ah jo@@ ong will work a movie with 16 million won budget next month .
and lee bo young is staying ab@@ road now after fin@@ ishing the last drama so succes@@ s@@ fully .
kim se@@ on ah , who is so hot these days , is already sched@@ ul@@ ed for a drama which will be ai@@ red wed@@ nes@@ day@@ -@@ thur@@ s@@ day in m broadcasting , so she 's not avail@@ able . and je@@ on ji hy@@ un has a casting in@@ quir@@ y from hollywood now , so she 's waiting for its fin@@ aliz@@ ation . and the last , e@@ om ji won , who is doing both tv and movie a lot these days , is done film@@ ing a movie now and re@@ vie@@ wing scrip@@ ts for the next project .
she says she will never work with k@@ ang hy@@ un min , even if she dies .
why is sung min ah not on this list ?
i heard her sched@@ ule is avail@@ able as well .
that 's because ... she 's an act@@ ress of empire production .
she can 't work with us because she belong@@ s to empire ?
yes , because our company is not on good ter@@ ms with empire .
more ac@@ cur@@ ately , anthony and oh jin wan are enem@@ ies so it won 't work , right ?
but why does it ... have anything to do with me ? crazy dog , you told me that if i give up that moment@@ ary 5 minutes , you will make sure that i will forget the past 5 years by the joy of succes@@ s . to taste that joy ,
no matter what .
look at me now ( in french )
wow , you are too good .
miss min ah , you 're fantast@@ ic , yes , great !
great pose , ok , yes ! now , ready , 1,2 . good !
you worked well .
it 's done for today .
good job .
- you all worked hard .
good job .
miss min ah , you were amazing today , as always .
i didn 't do much .
it 's all thanks to your great work of photo@@ graphy .
aig@@ oo , you 're even mo@@ dest !
sung min ah is indeed the best .
thanks for your work today .
don 't you ever sched@@ ule another shoot with that man .
why not ?
did he do something wrong ?
i can 't concentr@@ ate because of his bad breath !
alright , i 'll look into it .
a s@@ killed photo@@ grap@@ her who doesn 't have bad breath , ok ?
why don 't you guys go ahead .
it has been a long time .
you haven 't changed .
you 're still good at surpris@@ ing people .
take this .
what is that ?
it 's the script for the mini series for november mon@@ days and tu@@ es@@ days of s broadcasting .
i did hear that you were broke .
i guess that means your scale has shr@@ unk , too ?
for you to offer me a script of a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
compar@@ ed to the pa@@ the@@ tic writ@@ ers of empire who haven 't written anything wor@@ thy of the return of sung min ah for the past three years , it 's completely different .
what to do ?
in ad@@ dition to writ@@ ers , i also screen produ@@ cer@@ s .
is there anything else you need to know about me ?
how much are you going to pay me ?
as much as you want .
you can 't af@@ ford that , ever .
sure i can . because you 're the best act@@ ress , sung min ah .
read it carefully and give me a call .
my number hasn 't changed .
who is it ?
who ... who is it ?
did i star@@ tle you ?
i 'm just te@@ asing .
quite spac@@ ious for a writ@@ er 's studio .
about the same size as ... the second bathroom of my living room .
quit mo@@ cking , it 's my very first studio .
why have you come ?
well , just , uh@@ m ...
i thought i 'd check out the writ@@ er 's studio .
i heard that ... you saw my mom .
yes , i did .
i also received great words of wis@@ dom .
hey , you know it was in@@ evit@@ able .
thank you .
i normally don 't say thank you very often .
thank you .
i truly appreciate what you did this time .
i feel as if ...
i found a new friend .
then , be good from now on .
yeah , about that ...
wouldn 't it be better to take out that sw@@ im@@ ming at sea part ?
i 'd love it if that part was cut out from the whole script !
i don 't know about the others , but you absolutely have to sw@@ im in the ocean .
absolutely !
is that all ?
you said you can af@@ ford to pay me because i 'm the best act@@ ress there is .
yes .
then , let me ask you one thing .
do you still ... love me ?
if you would act for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
pre@@ view ep 8 how much longer do i have to ba@@ the those fil@@ thy br@@ ats ?
episode 8 rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements will not come hy@@ ung , why is he so late returning ? that 's what i 'm saying .
it has already been for more than 5 hours since he left to meet her . um ... represent@@ ative ?
what ? it 's nothing . pd jo@@ o .
yes .
quickly write a news release and circul@@ ate it to these media compan@@ ies i checked , the first thing in the morning tomorrow .
but ... what article are you talking about ?
the title is like this :
sung min ah confir@@ med as " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's " lead act@@ ress .
huh ?
an article about sung min ah join@@ ing our drama ?
sung min ah has decided to do our drama .
quickly get started on writing the news release . good work ,
crazy dog .
are you now ready to taste that joy ?
that 's right .
it 's now satisfac@@ tory .
what say you , feeling good ?
the best , that 's my feeling . even if anthony is very nast@@ y and mean , if you look into him , isn 't he a pretty okay produc@@ er ?
yes .
sometimes i want to beat him up , but like today he 's quite an okay produc@@ er .
by the way , when was the last time you took a bath ?
i ba@@ the every@@ day .
but i 'm not scr@@ ub@@ bing often .
no wonder ...
how can it be a human body ?
this is an er@@ as@@ er !
just kid@@ ding around .
bath over !
good bye .
b@@ ye-@@ bye hy@@ un wo@@ o .
don 't catch a cold .
oh , really nice !
why are you here ?
it 's my turn .
teacher , please let me take a break for a moment .
we 're just going to the bathroom for a second .
yes .
for how long do i have to wash dirty , dead skin@@ ned ras@@ c@@ als ?
you decided to do volun@@ te@@ er work for the meaning of self-@@ refle@@ ction .
do you think i 'm asking because i don 't know ?
! it would be enough to just shoot a few photos .
how much are you going to push me ?
! you , listen to me carefully .
in order for you to protect your image as a lead actor which you ru@@ ined you are not only scr@@ ub@@ bing body gr@@ ime but also sha@@ ving your hair . ( word play in kore@@ an )
my hair ?
right . even if you have to show them sha@@ ving your hair , you have to show them that you 're self-@@ reflec@@ ting .
i 'll just s@@ cru@@ b off dead skin .
good .
s@@ cru@@ b it off with all your might .
what 's with you ?
eat it .
what ?
i told you to eat it .
if he gives you something to eat , you should eat it .
director !
sung min ah ?
are you saying that sung min ah got cast@@ ed ?
right .
korea 's top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min with the best , sung min ah .
this is great !
we have the best casting combin@@ ation , right ?
hy@@ ung !
seems like you should come back . the kids are getting cold waiting .
ok , all right .
i 'll go and s@@ cru@@ b off those er@@ as@@ ers .
get going .
yes .
no way !
even if i don 't know anything else but this . even if i don 't know anything else but this .
with anthony 's drama you definitely can 't .
why ?
are you asking because you don 't know ?
! you always said this when i was a ro@@ o@@ kie .
this is a royal order .
shut your mouth and do what i tell you .
now i give the royal orders .
meet all the conditions they request , and proce@@ ed the contr@@ act .
what ?
i definitely told you .
i told you to proce@@ ed with the contr@@ act .
why on earth are you being like this ?
have you forgotten what anthony did to you ?
! one more thing .
don 't ask me for my reasons from now on .
if you want to continue to keep me under contr@@ act .
our af@@ fili@@ ated act@@ ress sung min ah is doing anthony 's drama ?
i 'm sorry .
even though i told her no , it 's what she wants .
no matter what it takes , i will stop her from acting in that drama .
no .
let her have her way .
par@@ don ?
what do you mean ...
the attack is allowed just once .
in this one opportunity , it 's important to go for the kill .
if you say " the only opportunity of attack .. " ?
where did you say the invest@@ or of anthony 's drama was ?
top@@ star sung min ah confir@@ med for ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong@@ '
set up the date for the script practice session and the drama press conference on 19@@ th .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min sung min ah
lead actor and act@@ ress of ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
no@@ tif@@ y the sched@@ ule to all media compan@@ ies , ac@@ tors , ac@@ tres@@ ses and staf@@ fs .
sung min ah 's drama come@@ back after 3 years don 't forget to send an invit@@ ation respec@@ t@@ fully to wat@@ an@@ abe group , the invest@@ or .
yes !
drama " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ultra@@ -@@ lux@@ ury casting yes , reporter park .
have you been well ?
this is world production calling .
i 'm sorry but as it was too ur@@ gent .
how is it going with our invit@@ ation cards ?
yes , please send them by 12@@ pm .
represent@@ ative !
the sun has ris@@ en a while ago .
stop sleeping , get up and get ready to go out .
where are we going ?
sung min ah said she wanted to meet you .
sung min ah ?
what is sung min ah 's character like ?
probably better than yours .
i read from an article that she is very though@@ t@@ ful .
hello ! i 'm lee go e@@ un .
you 're younger than i thought .
alright , let 's get some fresh air . you two have a chat .
i read and liked the script .
it 's been a long time since a script made me gre@@ edy like this one .
thank you .
but ...
yes ?
if there 's a problem ...
i 'm talking about episode one .
don 't you think that 's too much of the theme ?
too much of the theme ?
" a man 's sor@@ row@@ ful life story who lives in the dark age . "
the theme should th@@ ic@@ ken as time passes , not sho@@ wn all at once like that .
that 's why i decided to start by expl@@ aining the background with the charac@@ ters around the main guy .
that 's not what i 'm saying .
then ... the role of jin h@@ ye rim i 'm taking on , she 's not at all in episode one and appe@@ ars last in episode two .
if you brought an act@@ ress who is paid many tens of thous@@ ands won , you have to show her for the amount of time that f@@ its her price .
what are you im@@ ply ...
the female lead isn 't the male lead 's ma@@ id of hon@@ our .
to fit the name of sung min ah , rev@@ ise the script starting with episode one .
i fully understand what you 've said .
but the planned story line is ...
writ@@ er lee .
yes .
under whom did you learn ?
why are you asking ?
just like i thought , you really sm@@ ack of a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er .
i will make this clear .
you did not cast me .
i chose you . no , i chose this drama .
so right now i 'm not asking a fav@@ our .
i am not trying to give you ad@@ vice either .
so you 're saying right now that we don 't have a choice ?
it seems you 're not too much of a fool .
do you always crus@@ h writ@@ ers like that ?
no .
i didn 't need to .
the writ@@ ers i worked with up to now were veter@@ ans .
so they were aware and did all that was needed .
the ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er who knows nothing will only say one thing .
this drama is not a drama for you alone .
even if it 's for sung min ah , i can 't fix even one character .
you can 't fix it ?
yes .
for an actor who is full of ego@@ ist@@ ic pride and doesn 't think about the whole drama it 's un@@ necessary .
you look like you ended your chat well ...
yes .
very well .
you knew , right ?
what ?
do you know what sung min ah said to me ?
what could she have said . to match the role to the worth of her name .
by bringing me even when you knew that , i guess you tried to shake up my script again with the act@@ ress this time ? what could she have said . to match the role to the worth of her name .
by bringing me even when you knew that , i guess you tried to shake up my script again with the act@@ ress this time ? do you think that way ?
i was wrong for trust@@ ing you .
so ... what have you decided to do ?
who did you say was the new director of s broadcasting ?
okay , let 's see .
well done .
oh . make it possible to film this part also .
there will be a hidden scene behind the building .
i 've got it .
good , i think it 's done here , so ...
let 's go to jin h@@ ye rim 's room .
oh , writ@@ er lee !
hello .
oh , why are you here instead of writing ?
so it 's like that .
what 's the best thing to do , director ?
what did crazy dog say ?
it 's us@@ eless to hear from him . they planned together to change up my script .
ac@@ tors and ac@@ tres@@ ses are so weird .
sometimes , they run into the fire for their pieces , and ... even with not eating and staying up all night , they dedic@@ ate to their roles . but what i 'm saying is this .
there is something that the ac@@ tors never give up .
what is that ?
the ten@@ ac@@ ity toward their roles .
in other words , they never step back when it 's about getting their por@@ tion .
why is it like that ?
well ...
that 's just their nature .
with the natural ten@@ ac@@ ity they have , they accompl@@ ish their jobs .
they are like animals with the only instinc@@ t for acting .
then can 't we change their instinc@@ t ?
changing the instinc@@ t ...
that 's difficult even for me .
director !
all these are part of the strugg@@ les .
i wish you a good luck .
yes , director .
yes !
ah , writ@@ er lee . come in .
so , i 'll get going .
are you ?
no need to see me off .
i 'll contact you .
yes .
writ@@ er lee , have a seat .
yes .
i heard briefly about it .
yes .
right .
i myself am a drama cre@@ ator also , so i sympath@@ ise with your point of view and i 'm ro@@ oting for you .
thank you .
but now i 'll talk to you as the director of this drama 's broadcasting station .
sung min ah is an act@@ ress which all broad@@ ca@@ sters want to acqu@@ ire .
you know that , right ?
yes .
sung min ah 's dem@@ and is a dem@@ and that is totally under@@ stand@@ able from the point of view of a lead act@@ ress .
i hope you consider this point .
did you listen well to what the broadcasting director said ?
do you have to use your strength to pressure me like that ?
yes .
if i say that i do .
let 's talk for a while , us .
our conversation is possible after the revis@@ ed script comes out .
i clearly told you , i have not agreed to modi@@ f@@ ying the script .
you .
don 't act up .
your talent is quite something .
first writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , now even up to sung min ah .
you return the people whom you threw away col@@ dly back to your people .
you don 't person@@ ally need to get an infer@@ ior@@ ity complex . if there is one thing that i don 't have , it would be the infer@@ ior@@ ity complex that you stup@@ id@@ ly gras@@ p on .
that 's not an infer@@ ior@@ ity complex , it 's called fury .
don 't make the mistake of thinking that you 've already won .
i never tried to win against you . i am not doing that now , nor will i ever do that .
someone like you can 't become my target .
what to do ?
you 're my target .
then someone who failed with the target right in front of him , must be feeling frustr@@ ated .
laugh as much as you can while it last@@ s .
there will be a day when you will be stom@@ ped on sever@@ ely .
sang ta@@ e gu .
this is also so-@@ so . something else .
bit na .
you said this op@@ pa is aw@@ esome in whatever i wear .
but why is this not good ?
because you 're cool it 's just so-@@ so .
if that ch@@ ick sung min ah falls for you then what ?
then it can 't be helped .
op@@ pa !
op@@ pa is many people 's man .
and op@@ pa belong@@ s to bit na . don 't you know that ?
we 're just shooting a drama po@@ ster .
from now until the drama ends ... that bitch sung min ah will be stuck to you thro@@ ugh@@ out !
then would you rather have me wear out@@ f@@ its like a beg@@ gar while i film the drama ?
then promise . that you won 't look at that ch@@ ick first .
instead of a promise i 'll give you an o@@ ath .
that 's enough , right ? sung min ah is known for her pun@@ ctu@@ ality , but even if i step on hard , i think we will still be late about 20 minutes .
why are you stepping on ?
go slowly .
what ?
if the main actor k@@ ang hy@@ un min is late , even if it 's not 20 minutes but one hour they have to wait .
even if she 's hot these days , is she this drama 's protagon@@ ist ? if we pr@@ aise her all the time and do whatever she wants just because she is an act@@ ress , it will spo@@ il her . from the beginning , bam !
we should tam@@ e her .
run slowly , kw@@ ang so@@ o !
as for the po@@ ster 's theme this time , what about this ?
in this mood ... - no , i pre@@ fer this one .
will that be ok ?
what ?
what ? sung min ah ke@@ eps her ap@@ point@@ ments as shar@@ ply as a knife ?
so , didn 't i tell you to run slowly or what ?
kw@@ ang so@@ o ?
i tried to come as slowly as possible , but ...
sung min ah arrived !
hello , director .
oh , cp , hello ! - wow , you look fantast@@ ic !
you 're the best .
sorry i 'm a bit late .
no , it 's okay . do the mak@@ e-@@ up and the shooting will start right away .
yes .
- see you at the shooting studio .
min ah .
seems like you 're not good at keeping ap@@ point@@ ments .
sorry . then ...
see ?
dej@@ ec@@ ting her with simple and impact words .
she 's totally dej@@ ec@@ ted .
yes , president .
now almost all ac@@ tors have been decided , only the date that we start shooting is left .
so this is no les@@ ser than anthony .
it is pre@@ poster@@ ous , but there is one thing i have to tell you ...
let 's hear it . we may be a bit later that the shooting date that is speci@@ fied in the contr@@ act details , is that going to be alright ?
seeing how met@@ icul@@ ously you have done the prepar@@ ations , that is possible .
don 't pay too much attention to it .
thank you very much !
yes .
see you at the production report conference .
oh , good !
wow , whatever the camera takes is totally like a master@@ piece !
it 's killing !
hey , this ... this one ...
good !
good ! oh , min ah , it was a good shot !
okay !
good !
do it proper@@ ly .
act ... ion !
wow , this one is great , isn 't it , sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ?
wow , whatever the camera takes is the piece , piece !
you worked hard , director .
well done , well done .
what did i do today ?
this is a piece of cake compar@@ ed to the up@@ coming brut@@ al sched@@ ule .
but ... you asked for a script change ?
i heard it from the broad@@ caster .
yes .
i thought it would be better if a few points were amen@@ ded .
i wish the change to be complet@@ ed before the script reading session , but writ@@ er lee seemed to have a lot of thoughts in her mind .
please talk to her well .
then ... ah , yes , yes .
you can leave .
ais@@ h , writ@@ er lee , this ...
if she 's asked for a script change , she should rev@@ ise it ! she 's not y@@ iel@@ ding again ! sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im ,
i think you should step in here . what do you mean " step in " ?
well , writ@@ er lee , that kid@@ do , she 's quite dar@@ ing , sometimes . -@@ last time , when director moon ...
she 's not dar@@ ing , but per@@ sever@@ ing .
without that much back@@ bone , how can she write scrip@@ ts ?
no , that ... that ... ah , really ... sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im !
hy@@ ung !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
who on earth hi@@ red that photo@@ grap@@ her ?
why ? like a di@@ e-@@ for fan of sung min ah , he kept saying min ah , min ah ...
min ah ...
it was so anno@@ ying i though i was going to die ! hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung !
as you were not at the mak@@ e-@@ up room , i thought you left .
yes . anyway , since we 're going to spend a lot of time together from now on , let 's get along well .
i 'm sorry . my hands are a bit dirty ...
then ... what was that ?
is she ... ?
is she really refus@@ ing the hand@@ shake of this super@@ star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
crazy ...
aren 't you dis@@ regar@@ ding him a bit too much ?
he 's just a pu@@ pp@@ y@@ ish br@@ at who thinks he 's an actor .
he 's not even worth conver@@ sing with .
yes , chief produc@@ er .
writ@@ er lee .
are you in your right mind ?
par@@ don ?
what do you ... mean ?
sung min ah of all people is asking for a script revision .
why can 't you y@@ ield ?
why ?
! no need to talk more . as per sung min ah 's request , change the script .
it doesn 't suit you .
in a building that doesn 't suit you at all and the sha@@ b@@ by office ...
did you come to confir@@ m that ?
that writ@@ er ...
how is she ?
exactly , the same as you see .
she just has her tem@@ per , not comprom@@ ising .
can you fire that writ@@ er ?
i 'm asking if you can fire her for me .
what are you talking about ?
who knows .
i just wanted to know your thoughts .
before that let me ask something as well .
what are you going to do if lee go e@@ un won 't change her script to the end ?
the things i want , i get all of them , as you know . of course ,
i couldn 't have only one person , though .
in the future it will be difficult as well .
i know .
that you don 't feel or want such a thing like love .
but i don 't care .
because i will make you love me .
after all , that was what i thought .
you were trying to shake the scrip@@ ts as you want by a sch@@ eme with sung min ah .
there was no such intention at all .
but it 's clear that it was pre@@ determined .
it was pre@@ determined ?
sung min ah is an act@@ ress in the position who can choose not only her co-@@ star but also the writ@@ er .
this is the in@@ evit@@ able process we should en@@ dure from the moment sung min ah was cast .
you promised me that you wouldn 't touch the script .
i definitely did .
but now you 're telling me to change it , even by using the act@@ ress , manag@@ ers of the broadcasting station !
i have not told you to fix the script even once .
what did you say ?
fighting with a director , strugg@@ ling with a produc@@ er , being interfer@@ ed by the broadcasting station , and having a power game with ac@@ tors consist@@ ently are a drama writ@@ er 's fate !
that 's why i was once fired by the pressure from the broadcasting station , and fought with you all the time , represent@@ ative .
now i 'm fighting with the act@@ ress .
right now , you know i would obviously lose , so you 're telling me there is no need to fight .
no !
fight !
fight open@@ ly on the square against her !
you said you wanted to protect your script .
so fight . fight and win !
but in return , you 're fighting alone .
no one at all will help you .
so ... being a writ@@ er is an infin@@ it@@ ely lonely job .
oh , right now ?
yes . understood .
represent@@ ative .
it was cp lee sung g@@ yu that just called .
he wants you to come to the station right now .
right now ?
he wants to talk with you about the production budget .
fight !
face the challenge and fight on !
you said you want to protect your script , right ?
then , fight . fight and win .
however , you 'll be fighting on your own .
not a single soul will help you .
writ@@ er lee .
jo@@ o pd .
i have a favor to ask of you .
that does not make sense .
it 's a period piece with k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah as the lead@@ s .
you got 10 bil@@ lion won from the spon@@ sor , you have enough to cus@@ hi@@ on that ! that 10 bil@@ lion is only an invest@@ ment that needs to be returned to the produc@@ er once the drama is finished .
well , that .. that is true .
of course , i know that .
total production cost is 9.@@ 8 bil@@ lion .
the 300 million per episode makes 6 bil@@ lion .
projec@@ ted international sales is 1.7 bil@@ lion .
cable network sales is 10 bil@@ lion .
that 's only 8.@@ 7 bil@@ lion in total .
you want me to take a defic@@ it of 1.1 bil@@ lion won ?
no ... you want me to take a defic@@ it of 1.1 bil@@ lion won ? no ...
that 's not what i mean ...
no ...
that 's right !
produc@@ t plac@@ ements ! you can get money that way !
the histor@@ ical setting is during japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation . produc@@ t plac@@ ements are not vi@@ able !
that ...
i see .
i 'll talk with the director in person .
represent@@ ative kim ...
why do you have to give us so much trouble ?
just go easy on us .
and besides , the director is not in his office at the moment .
hey , hey , hey , wait .
it 's my treat .
are you putting it on the corpor@@ ate card as the director ?
hey , i don 't use the corpor@@ ate card on my personal business .
install@@ ments for 3 months , please .
hey , what is wan so@@ o doing ?
un@@ emplo@@ yed .
represent@@ ative kim , what br@@ ings you here ?
i came to see you , director .
i 'm sorry .
i guess i need to talk with him .
alright , i will see you later .
i 'll call you
- okay .
what is it ? is it ur@@ gent ?
it 's about the production cost of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
if it 's about the production cost , it 's no use for you to come here , represent@@ ative kim .
it 's been already decided , as you know .
i don 't understand why you 're giving us an amount similar to small dram@@ as like " children of paradise . "
do you think that drama will gu@@ aran@@ tee as much commercial adver@@ tis@@ ement profit as my drama ?
probably not .
but that is why that drama is important to us as well .
because nobody invest@@ s money in it .
nobody expec@@ ts it to make any money .
if you know that it 's not going to make any money , why do it ?
because the world today desperately needs that drama . understood ?
are you saying that " morning of k@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ ong " is not a drama the world needs ?
no , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has its own value , too , that the world can benef@@ it from .
plus , it 's got commercial potential as well .
it 's a great drama .
however , even dram@@ as that nobody thinks will make money need to be produc@@ ed , is what i think .
not for prof@@ its , but for its benef@@ its to the society .
do you enjoy playing hol@@ ier@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ th@@ ou like that ? sure , i suppose someone like you wouldn 't know the joy in it .
sure .
it seems that the mas@@ sage place is the most likely place at that hour .
welcome .
may i see your member id ?
miss sung min ah is inside , right ?
i 'm here to see miss sung min ah .
a visit@@ or ?
who ?
lee go e@@ un , she said you know her .
tell her exactly what i say .
she said that unless you brought the changed script , she won 't see you , so you should leave .
yes .
ah , hey !
- i 'm sorry . - please , stop !
i 'm sorry .
- you can 't do this !
it 's an emergen@@ cy .
listen , stop ... !
here you are .
i 'm so sorry .
get out of here , now !
just one moment .
you 're quite an interesting person .
i 'm more interesting once you get to know me better .
can you give us some priv@@ acy ?
now , enter@@ tain me .
i 'm not making dram@@ as as a char@@ ity .
yes , i know very well that all you live for is money , represent@@ ative kim . oh , and also , from now on , any business about the drama should be communic@@ ated through the cp in charge .
aig@@ oo , fan@@ cy meeting you here !
director nam wo@@ on young !
though i 'm rather late , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations on your promotion to director .
i suppose you are late . thanks anyway .
i see , you hate me .
why would i do that ?
you 're at the top of the food chain in the drama world .
well then , excuse me ...
long time no see .
let me give you a warning .
leave this field while i 'm still being civil .
you 're the one whose time has come to retire , cha@@ ir@@ man .
i decide my own destiny .
i can also decide your destiny .
and what are you going to decide ?
just wait .
you 'll find out soon enough .
i look forward to it .
that 's why you can 't accept it .
yes .
you know the ris@@ ks involved with that decision .
why ins@@ ist ?
why are you ris@@ king your job for this ? the legen@@ dary british actor alec guinness once said , " there 's no such thing as a small part .
you 're trying to school me ?
didn 't you decide to take this part after reading the original script ? you found worth and potential in the details of the script , then , you shouldn 't acti@@ vely se@@ ek to ru@@ in the potential you saw in it .
it would be bad for you yourself , too .
also ... there will be no revision of scrip@@ ts .
so you can drink so@@ ju too .
what 's the res@@ ult of the fight ?
i heard from pd jo@@ o that you went to see sung min ah .
there will be no revis@@ ions on scrip@@ ts .
and sung min ah will atten@@ d neither the script reading session nor the production report conference tomorrow .
yes , she will atten@@ d .
why do you think so ?
because sung min ah is a professional .
profession@@ als have infin@@ ite sense of respon@@ sibil@@ ity about their work .
a profes@@ sion with sense of respon@@ sibil@@ ity is doing this for her own interest only ?
both a professional and an amateur , they all make a mistake .
then , an amateur bl@@ ames the world , but a professional takes time in reflec@@ ting on herself / himself .
take time ... ?
that 's right .
time which an amateur like you wouldn 't dare to think about .
both a professional and an amateur , they all make a mistake .
then , an amateur bl@@ ames the world , but a professional takes time in reflec@@ ting on herself / himself .
time which an amateur like you wouldn 't dare to think about .
i mean , episode 1 , don 't you think it shows it 's theme exces@@ si@@ vely ?
finally , the first day of the official sched@@ ule for the drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is starting .
at 2 pm , meeting all ac@@ tors and reading the scrip@@ ts . at 5 pm , moving to the audit@@ orium and having the production report conference .
from now on , everyone , remember exactly what you have to do and proce@@ ed without fa@@ il .
yes , i understand !
go@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae , set up the room for reading scrip@@ ts by 2 pm .
manager park , check the ac@@ tors as per their sched@@ ule and make calls to confir@@ m .
ah , yes , so you 're on your way here ?
pd jo@@ o , go to the audit@@ orium directly , and check all the details for the last time .
the main po@@ ster on the background must be placed with extreme care .
yes , reporter park !
manager han , call all repor@@ ters of media compan@@ ies and portal sites , and get their anticip@@ ated questions in advan@@ ce .
yes .
now , i think you should go to the reading room .
okay .
ah , and wat@@ an@@ abe group contac@@ ted me , and told me that cha@@ ir@@ man won 't be able to come .
i see .
when would he arrive ?
it will be at 2 : 35@@ pm .
but .. do you have to pick him up person@@ ally , cha@@ ir@@ man ?
to the airport , i can go ...
the leader of wat@@ an@@ abe group which asse@@ ts are worth of 60 bil@@ lion yen ( about us $ 730 million ) is coming , so i should show some cour@@ tes@@ y to him at least .
what is with that face ?
i made a revision on the script .
these are the revis@@ ed version of episode 1 and 2 of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
revision ?
why did you change your mind ?
yesterday , i went back home and took time to read them again .
and ?
i could see that .
the exces@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of theme .
so , do these scrip@@ ts not have exces@@ sive theme any longer ?
i will show the comple@@ tion of theme at the last episode .
you sound pretty confid@@ ent .
if i weren 't confid@@ ent , i wouldn 't have even started it .
how is it ?
this ro@@ o@@ kie is pretty good .
her writing s@@ kill is quite wor@@ kab@@ le .
ah ... this is not good .
what is it ?
does it make sense ?
does she have any brain or not ?
hy@@ un min , even so , shouldn 't you read the revis@@ ed script before the reading session ? hy@@ ung , in a car , why would i read it , hur@@ ting my eyes ?
i can read it when i get there .
what do you think ?
can 't you know by just sm@@ elling it ?
that this is quite something ?
what are you doing ?
you should print out the new scrip@@ ts !
yes . by the way , you 're not even on episode 1 , but you came quite early .
you could 've come 1 hour late .
what was that ?
ais@@ h , with my tem@@ per , i just should 've ...
go inside first . you were so confid@@ ent , but i guess you were scared after all .
yes , i was scared .
i was scared if i would lose the compo@@ sure of my life .
thank you all for coming here for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
now , let 's start the reading session for episode 1 and episode 2 .
well , episode 1 of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
scene 1 , panor@@ ama of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong city , li@@ vely k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong city is sho@@ wn .
on the road , a stre@@ et@@ car is passing , and many pe@@ dest@@ ri@@ ans between r@@ ick@@ sha@@ ws .
then a cu@@ t-@@ in , " november 7@@ th , 1938 . "
one man who walks through a crowd , it 's the main role , kim wo@@ o jin . wo@@ o jin , he looks around for a moment , then appro@@ aches to a pe@@ dd@@ ler whose face is covered with a towel .
what do you think the weather of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong would be tomorrow ? he looks around for a moment , then appro@@ aches to a pe@@ dd@@ ler whose face is covered with a towel . what do you think the weather of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong would be tomorrow ?
a pe@@ dd@@ ler , looking around for a moment , pulls out something from the inside pocket and gives it to wo@@ o jin . wo@@ o jin , getting close his face to that pe@@ dd@@ ler .
there must be one more .
the pe@@ dd@@ ler , opening the to@@ wel@@ s which covered the face , is the main female role , jin h@@ ye rin .
the other one will arrive tonight .
it will come out at midnight , through the check register machine .
wo@@ o jin , after taking a moment to think something , whispers .
wo@@ o jin , after taking a moment to think something , whispers . mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , it 's your turn to read .
what 's wrong with you ?
what 's wrong with me ?
when i said i wouldn 't sw@@ im in the sea , you didn 't even sn@@ iff , but now without my per@@ mission , you were totally seduc@@ ed by that fox and changed all scrip@@ ts .
and now what ?
what 's wrong with me ?
i can 't do with these scrip@@ ts . no ,
i won 't .
director , i 'm sorry .
with this feeling , i can 't do this , either .
so , it 's finally started .
par@@ don ?
what do you mean ?
every@@ time , whenever the drama starts , this happens , the war of ner@@ ves among animals .
par@@ don ?
pd jo@@ o , do you know where we are ?
this is a jungle made of as@@ ph@@ alt .
what are you doing now ?
are you asking that because you don 't know ?
lower your voice .
don 't you see those repor@@ ters ?
smile . and relax your har@@ den@@ ed face first .
if we 're not going to use the original scrip@@ ts , i won 't be able to smile comfor@@ tab@@ ly .
never .
until when will you wh@@ ine all the time , without thinking straight ?
do you think i 'm now wh@@ in@@ ing ?
this way , please .
ah , here is col@@ der than fuku@@ oka .
ah , yes .
the president of the best broadcasting station in korea came himself to welcome us .
since you 're coming , of course , i should come welcome you , cha@@ ir@@ man .
thank you .
this is the president of s@@ bc .
and this is the son of wat@@ an@@ abe , the he@@ ir of wat@@ an@@ abe group , mr. wat@@ an@@ abe ken@@ ji .
ah , i see . nice to meet you .
my name is je@@ ong ji hy@@ un .
nice to meet you . ( in kore@@ an )
i 'm wat@@ an@@ abe ken@@ ji .
you 're speaking kore@@ an very well .
because i have business in korea too .
please keep making invest@@ ments for our future kore@@ an dram@@ as too .
let 's go inside .
yes , this way .
so what do you want me to do ?
are you saying i should go back in ?
the production announ@@ cement is soon .
should i go out there alone ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is going to come .
i trust our re@@ p will bring him back .
so , please , come back in .
writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i thought i warned you already .
don 't act up .
that 's not it
this is a favor .
i guess this drama is nothing to you as if it 's a children 's play . the penal@@ ty of three times of 2 bil@@ lion won you received for this drama , if you 're not going to bring that 6 bil@@ lion won back , go back to that room immediately .
i didn 't say i wouldn 't play for this drama .
i said i can 't do it with that revis@@ ed script .
why don 't you go back when i say nic@@ ely ?
why ?
will you punch me otherwise ?
what are you doing ?
i can make it even worse ! using your perfectly fine mother to cover up your du@@ i case , should i sp@@ ill it all out that it 's all f@@ ake ? leave if you can , and i will tell people everything in that press conference .
are you saying you will kill both of us ?
whether dying now or dying slowly after public hum@@ il@@ ation , it 's all same to me .
don 't lie to me .
do you think i will fall for that blu@@ ff ?
i don 't care if you believe it or not . i have nothing to fear any longer . choose whether we die together , or live together .
soon , the production report conference for drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be started .
please turn off your cell phones for a moment .
have a good time , ma '@@ am .
thank you .
thanks to go e@@ un , i 'm having a chance to see this kind of show .
by the way , why is she wearing black sung@@ las@@ ses in@@ doors ?
with that , can you see proper@@ ly ?
is this young wen@@ ch de@@ af ?
i guess she 's totally fine .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min stor@@ med out during the reading session .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why ... ? did he run away ?
why ?
-@@ yes .
why ?
he said he wouldn 't play for the revis@@ ed script .
you punk ... !
you should 've held even his pants to stop him !
right now , the press conference is getting ready to begin .
what about sung min ah ?
she also said she would leave , but writ@@ er lee is holding on to her .
where is the mc .... ?
now , the production report conference for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be started .
hello , everyone . i 'm your host , lee il h@@ wan .
this is driving me crazy
okay , then let me introdu@@ ce to you the two stars appe@@ aring in " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " k@@ ang hy@@ un min , sung min ah , and also director go@@ o .
let 's bring them in .
hey , what are you doing ?
quickly go and find out what 's going on .
yes
what a com@@ edy this is ... well , i guess they are having a moment to give us more dramat@@ ic effect . please wait for a moment .
well , the male lead actor , the female lead act@@ ress and director , would you please come out ?
i 'm going crazy ..@@ ... because of the script reading session which was planned before this conference , i 'm afraid the sched@@ ule has been a little bit del@@ ayed .
please wait a moment longer
they say that k@@ ang hy@@ un min might not atten@@ d this conference because of some ur@@ gent issue .
i 'm sorry
i 'm afraid i will have to leave first .
yes
we 'd better get going , too .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's not arrived yet ?
yes .
what do we do ?
what else is there to do ?
we need to go in there at least .
well , let 's go in .
going in without the protagon@@ ist ?
i 'm sorry , director . i came a bit late .
as much time as you took , you just make the food ta@@ st@@ y ..
what about the represent@@ ative ?
well , the situation in there didn 't seem good . but are you okay to be here , doing nothing ?
what brought you here ?
well , this isn 't a place i can 't come , you know .
oh , introdu@@ ce yourself to him . this is ken@@ ji , the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group .
i 'm ken@@ ji , the son of wat@@ an@@ abe hi@@ ros@@ hi .
then ... the cha@@ ir@@ man is ...
and as the new cha@@ ir@@ man of wat@@ an@@ abe group , i 'm telling you , that all invest@@ ment to world production and anthony kim will be with@@ drawn as of now .
and 3.4 bil@@ lion won previ@@ ously given for the parti@@ al invest@@ ment must be returned within this month .
episode 9 battle of red cli@@ ffs it seems the situation in there wasn 't good . but is it okay for you to be here , doing nothing ?
what brought you here ? well , this isn 't a place i can 't come , as you know . oh , introdu@@ ce yourself to him .
this is ken@@ ji , the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group . i 'm ken@@ ji , the son of wat@@ an@@ abe hi@@ ros@@ hi . then ... the cha@@ ir@@ man is ...
his ill@@ ness has gotten more serious , so he gave all management rights to me .
and as the new ceo of wat@@ an@@ abe group , i 'm telling you ... that all invest@@ ments to world production and anthony kim ... will be with@@ drawn as of now .
and the 3.4 bil@@ lion won previ@@ ously given for the parti@@ al invest@@ ment ... must be returned within this month .
that is not possible .
if all the management rights were passed on to you , so would have the invest@@ ment contr@@ acts as well .
how can you ask for the 3.4 bil@@ lion back ?
i believe that the starting date for shooting is today on the contr@@ act .
i am making a reason@@ able request based on a bre@@ ach of the contr@@ act .
however , cha@@ ir@@ man wat@@ an@@ abe and i had a ver@@ bal agreement on it !
a business man makes prom@@ ises by sig@@ ning and pro@@ ves with documents .
and also , anthony , let me tell you again ...
i am the cha@@ ir@@ man now .
i 'll excuse myself .
oh , yes .
didn 't i tell you before ?
that i de@@ termine your fate as well . no matter how much you wish for it ,
i 'm not going down this easily .
well , it 's not going to be easy .
i wish you good luck .
stay strong ...
sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im .
you two , i don 't want any more tension like this after today .
such tension needs to be while you 're on camera , not out of it .
okay , let 's go in .
what going on ?
-@@ just stay still .
really ?
they are here now .
yes , everyone , you waited long enough .
the " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ac@@ tors , k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah .
this way .
well then , please give a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e .. .. for the two lead ac@@ tors and the director of ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
just now , what were they talking about ?
with@@ drawing the invest@@ ment .. ?
is it true that we have to return all the invest@@ ment money we received ?
what did they say ? say something .
represent@@ ative ...
represent@@ ative !
well then , we 'll begin the photo time for the two ac@@ tors .
i request the ac@@ tors to please use the center of the stage .
ah , really , they look so beautiful like a new@@ ly@@ wed couple .
please use the center of the stage .
i did tell you but the main lead of this drama is me .
i don 't think you 're acting s@@ kill can handle that .
that 's funny .
that 's what i should be saying .
please look at the front .
what is the reason you are res@@ cin@@ ding the finances ?
i don 't have any interest in your drama .
what i am interested in .. .. is whether you can pay me back the 3.4 bil@@ lion .
i can .
in case you can 't ... are you willing to give up your hand as a promise ? i can promise . but before that ,
i need to confir@@ m if mr. wat@@ an@@ abe also thinks the same . then give it a try .
right now , father is in korea .
he is seriously ill .
he wanted to be in korea during his final days .
he has passed away .
the cha@@ ir@@ man ... has left you a letter before passing away .
mr. anthony , i 'm sorry .
it seems that i am finally pay@@ ing for all the w@@ ron@@ gs i have commit@@ ted during my life .
i can sense that i 'll be in hell soon .
i wanted to watch your drama please forgive me who left without keeping his promise .
even if cha@@ ir@@ man wasn 't able to keep his promise
i will keep that promise .
even in hell , you will get to see ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
wat@@ an@@ abe is dead .
that 's too bad . now that the invest@@ ment is cancel@@ led for sure , there is nothing anthony can do .
it 's not over yet .
yes ?
anthony will be running around , looking for money .
we have to stop him from getting any invest@@ ments .
however , it is going to be difficult to ga@@ ther such a big amount in so little time .
is it really worth it to go to that length because of anthony ?
anthony , that bastard , is someone who wants to tear me down . until i see his last breath fa@@ de away with my own eyes , this war is not over !
when he said he couldn 't come to the show@@ case , i had no idea it was because he was ill .
who would 've ever thought he 'd pass away like that .. anyway , it 's a big hit if we have to return the invest@@ ment .
out of the 3.4 bil@@ lion , we 've used most of it and have only 100 million left . in other words , before this month is over , we have to find 3.3 bil@@ lion ?
can 't we find another invest@@ or in time ?
given this econom@@ y , it will be tou@@ gh to find a willing invest@@ or .
besides , the amount is too huge .
even if we were to take a loan , we have nothing for col@@ lateral . even if we mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously got that much money , we have to start shooting next week ....
then what are we going to do ?
are we going to end like this ?
how can we give up like that after coming all the way here .
be strong people . we never know , some kind of miracle might happen .
that 's right .
we need a miracle .
however , miracle is not something you wait for but something you make . from now on , without wast@@ ing one breath and without looking back , we 're going to run only looking ahead .
commence our meeting .
yes .
in reality , getting an invest@@ ment in a short period of time is not easy .
but we can try to get a loan from banks putting our drama as a col@@ lateral .
how much money is left in our account ?
we have about 120 million won . ( us $ 120@@ ,000 )
good , with that money , make sure the first shooting is to be prepared without any trouble .
but to return the fund on time , it would be better not to use that money ...
no , the first shooting should be succes@@ s@@ ful no matter what . rather than waiting for a slow death next to an o@@ asis which is dr@@ ying up , we should run to the end of the horizon with all our strength left .
does everyone understand ?
yes .
does everyone understand ?
yes .
good . team leader park , ar@@ range me@@ et@@ ings with our main banks .
and let 's contact other financial compan@@ ies , one by one , too .
if we can get from three compan@@ ies , the amount of each loan can be reduc@@ ed , so the possibil@@ ity ( to get the loan ) would be greater .
yes , i understand .
pd jo@@ o , manager han and he@@ e j@@ ae , you guys divide the works and prepare the shooting perfectly .
yes . well then , from now on , run to the end of the horizon as fast as we can and escape from this desert !
yes .
do you want to be in a situation later with only sending a one page script ?
what are you doing not getting on with your writing ?
yes , represent@@ ative .
i 've made a list of minor financial compan@@ ies which we might be able to get some lo@@ ans .
those are lo@@ cated within seoul or near seoul .
these three seem mostly wor@@ kab@@ le .
call them and sched@@ ule an ap@@ pointment .
jo@@ o pd , come here and look at this .
yes .
take a look at this .
it 's 14,@@ 29@@ 3,000 won .
it 's way over the budget .
please put this back .
anthony has a lot of money .
what about this ?
camera 1 will be placed over there in a long shot .
camera 2 on the boat , and camera 3 will film k@@ ang hy@@ un min jum@@ ping in the water in a full shot .
what do you think ?
yes , i think that would be good .
let 's go .
yes . your air@@ -@@ date is also fixed , and the lead actor and act@@ ress are top stars .
as long as you meet our conditions , i don 't think it would be difficult .
thank you very much .
then we will prepare all the necessary documents today and come back tomorrow .
if you could please wait for a while .
yes , head director .
yes ?
yes .
i understand .
well this ..
i don 't know how to tell you .
i 'm afraid that for this case , we won 't be able to give you the loan .
why are you saying this suddenly ?
i 'm really sorry .
this is because of our intern@@ al problem .
what is that intern@@ al problem ?
i 'm really sorry .
please don 't ask me about the reason why .
i 'm sorry , but it would be difficult .
this drama has sung min ah and k@@ ang hy@@ un min as main ac@@ tors .
its air date is also set now .
i 'm sorry .
it 's because our branch 's situation isn 't great now .
i 'm sorry , but it will be hard for us .
i 'm sorry , but it will be difficult for us .
please look over it one more time .
i am sorry .
i 'm sorry .
the hig@@ her@@ -@@ up@@ s aren 't comfortable .
please understand our situation too .
well , i think i 'm always asking you a difficult favor every time , president ( of a bank ) .
right , why don 't we go for a ro@@ unding ( golf ) some time soon ?
ah , yes .
yes , yes .
i understand .
what is the reason that you suddenly say it won 't work ?
we got it ordered from the boss , so we can 't do anything about it .
the boss ?
the boss ? i 'm really sorry .
yes , pd jo@@ o .
represent@@ ative , we have a problem .
the ship that we rent@@ ed wasn 't arri@@ ving , so i checked it up .
they are saying that they can 't send us the ship if we don 't pay twice of what we made the contr@@ act .
what ?
twice ?
yes .
if that happens , it will be way over our fund that we planned .
what should we do ?
as you know , the money is a little ...
hey crazy dog !
we at least need a ship to put the computer graphic on or whatever .
are you doing this because you don 't want to spend the money ?
i 'm really sorry director .
part of our invest@@ ment was cut off .
what ?
the invest@@ ment ?
yes , however it will be resol@@ ved soon .
please trust me .
sung min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah . se@@ ong min ah .
se@@ ong min ah .
again .
again .
again !
still se@@ ong min ah !
does this make 's sense
she said she would write it for me !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
hey , what 's the score until now ?
37 to 38 .
se@@ ong min ah is leading by a lot .
oh my god !
jesus christ
se@@ ong min ah , that fo@@ x-@@ like woman st@@ ole away all my scenes !
hy@@ ung , with this time , you better memor@@ ize an extra line of the new script ...
what did you say , you punk ?
do you think i could concentr@@ ate on the script now ?
kw@@ ang so@@ o !
but still , why hasn 't the shooting started yet ?
i need to go and check .
why is the shooting taking so long to start ?
min ah , we have a problem .
the invest@@ ment from japan is cut off .
what is going on ?
nothing serious .
they said there was a problem with the invest@@ or .
it seems we have some problems but they will be sol@@ ved soon .
you know how anthony , despite being a dog , is good at hand@@ ling these things well , don 't get too de@@ pressed , let 's call it a day .
as you had instruc@@ ted , i made it so that the rent@@ ed ship won 't come to them , but is it really necessary to go to this length when anthony 's money has already dri@@ ed up ?
the broadcasting network needs to know that anthony has lost the invest@@ ment .
that way , his last desperate efforts will get even more gru@@ esome .
so , how are things going then ?
we 're cur@@ r@@ ently looking into new invest@@ ors so please don 't worry about it . the broadcasting license fee of 300 million per episode , we 'll pay the first episode 's in advan@@ ce .
thank you , head director .
however , this is how far i can be of help .
you have to take care of the finances as soon as possible .
if anything goes wrong , the board of direc@@ tors will have an u@@ pro@@ ar .
an u@@ pro@@ ar ?
they 'll want to sue you for fa@@ iling to fill the broadcasting s@@ lot .
[ sung min ah ]
it 's me .
min ah .
yes .
i heard that you are having some diffic@@ ulti@@ es
i 'll sol@@ ve it .
don 't worry too much .
let 's talk later .
op@@ pa .
do you remember what we talked about some time before ?
the thing we talked about during christmas at my place ?
let 's meet now .
prepare well for the shooting .
that 's how you can help me at the moment .
-@@ op@@ pa
- yes ?
later , after a long time .
once i become a famous top star , if i become someone who can help you , someone who 's strong and powerful ...
once you become one ?
when that time comes , will you accept my help ?
sure .
we 'll do that i guess .
really ?
but something like that won 't happen .
there 's a lot that you still don 't know about me .
like what type of person i am .
un@@ nie .
yes ?
what ?
contact represent@@ ative oh and tell him i have to see him .
min ah . you@@ - right now .
pd jo@@ o , get the car ready .
we 're going to m@@ ye@@ ong@@ dong .
what ?
no . you can 't , represent@@ ative .
no , i know we 're desperate , but to take a private loan ...
move .
we can 't .
the ann@@ ual interest rate is 200 % !
this is practically k@@ icking the bu@@ cket yourself !
i 'm with him .
even if our drama were to succe@@ ed .. no , even before that , we 'll all die !
i agree with them , represent@@ ative .
last time you did that , the company went ban@@ krup@@ t , you even lost your house !
the only hope we have left is cha@@ ir@@ man j@@ ang of m@@ ye@@ ong@@ dong .
represent@@ ative , i am done revis@@ ing episodes 3 and 4 ...
what 's wrong with him ? all our loan applications were rej@@ ec@@ ted , so now he 's going to get a private loan .
private loan ?
yes . then . after all you 've been through , you haven 't had enough and are still doing dram@@ as ?
it 's a drama with a set broadcasting sched@@ ule and top stars as leading ac@@ tors .
the documents inclu@@ ded are a copy of the broadcasting s@@ lot certific@@ ate and an amo@@ tiz@@ ation sched@@ ule .
even still , you 've come to me because you didn 't get any invest@@ ment .
how much ?
i need three or four big ones .
you need 3.4 bil@@ lion ?
yes .
and the col@@ lateral ?
my hand that will lead this drama to succes@@ s is the col@@ lateral .
please help .
anthony . your hand ... no , your body ,
bring me a real col@@ lateral .
cha@@ ir@@ man ... secre@@ tary choi , take him away !
cha@@ ir@@ man , i beg you !
i can even sell all my intern@@ al organ@@ s !
if i could give you all my scal@@ p , i 'd glad@@ ly skin my head .
i could serve you as a slave the rest of my life , cha@@ ir@@ man !
please , i beg you .
just this once !
cha@@ ir@@ man ! after losing everything , coming to me again and beg@@ ging like that , you 're the first . i don 't know how much this drama means to you , just give up !
cha@@ ir@@ man ...
you know what 's cru@@ eler than money ?
human amb@@ ition . if you don 't want to ru@@ in your life , start by throwing that away .
cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man , please help me !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
don 't kick me out like this ! please , cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
please help me , cha@@ ir@@ man !
cha@@ ir@@ man , don 't kick me out !
cha@@ ir@@ man !
i beg you , cha@@ ir@@ man !
i don 't know how much this drama means to you , just give up !
you know what 's cru@@ eler than money ?
human amb@@ ition .
if you don 't want to ru@@ in your life . start by throwing that away .
who hasn 't turned in the school support fee yet ?
come out !
you must turn them in by tomorrow !
got it ?
yes !
good !
if you can bring the fee by tomorrow , you may go back to your seat .
what 's with you ?
you aren 't going to bring it tomorrow ?
you 'll be hit until you answer me that you 'll bring it .
you got it ?
answer !
you won 't even if i do this ?
you think you 're so tou@@ gh ?
answer me !
why are you so late ?
you 're hungry , right ?
come and eat .
i ate already .
why do we live so poor ?
why ?
did something happen at school ?
tell me , why are we so poor ?
!
something happened at school ?
i 'm not going to live like you mom .
i 'm going to ear@@ n money like crazy , and eat meat until my stomach bur@@ sts .
i 'll become a big shot that ri@@ des his own car !
i 'm going to make money even if i die !
even if i die !
i 'm im@@ pressed that you 've last@@ ed for 3 years in this sha@@ b@@ by office . that you 'd go to such leng@@ ths to make sure i 'm ru@@ ined ,
i had no idea , cha@@ ir@@ man . you didn 't even hesit@@ ate st@@ aining your own noble hands , why are you so in@@ tent on crus@@ hing me ?
that 's because i know the met@@ tle of your being more than any@@ body else .
you res@@ em@@ ble me a lot .
that 's why i speci@@ ally took a lik@@ ing to you . even so , you deser@@ ted me 3 years ago , and that wasn 't enough ? even so , you deser@@ ted me 3 years ago , and that wasn 't enough ?
what exactly is it that you want ?
leave ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' to me .
i 'll give you .@@ 5 bil@@ lion in return .
i 'll also throw in the re@@ pay@@ ment of the 3.4 bil@@ lion of wat@@ an@@ abe invest@@ ment .
how about it ?
i think that 's enough compen@@ sation for all the work you 've put into it so far .
why ?
why are you willing to go so far in order to get ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ?
you think my go@@ al is to produce just one pet@@ ty little drama like that ?
i want something much bigger .
although i guess the one who so@@ wed the se@@ ed of my big amb@@ ition doesn 't remember .
give it a good thought . whether to waste your life in ja@@ il with a huge de@@ bt crus@@ hing your shoulders , or to live an ordin@@ ary life with half a bil@@ lion won .
are you going to the cha@@ ir@@ man of empire ?
go .
go take that money .
i 'll also drop ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
isn 't it alright as long as we can start working on the next project ?
we 've made it thus far , we can try again .
it should be alright if i write another great piece .
i 'm sorry .
who is it ?
i 'm here to meet the cha@@ ir@@ man .
that 's right .
have you come to a decision ?
yes .
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ... .. i can@@ not leave it in your hands .
you should know the best that you only have one week to return the invest@@ ment .
yes , i 'm well aware of that .
however , i 'd rather die than hand over that project to you .
you 're going for a hero@@ ic suicide ?
i 'll leave it up to the gods .
who knows ?
you , cha@@ ir@@ man , could be in cao cao 's shoes , running away from the sea of red flames at the red cliff . [ romance of three king@@ dom@@ s reference ] still , in the end , it was cao cao who con@@ quer@@ ed the world .
do you think i will lose ?
what are you doing ?
don 't you know that for a writ@@ er , good health is money and time is money ?
what 's going to happen with the script if you get a cold ?
why are you outside ?
i decided to fight .
is it possible for us to win ?
what is it at this late hour ?
was it your doing , represent@@ ative ?
what ?
the can@@ cell@@ ation of the invest@@ ment of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . " min ah , i know about your feelings for anthony , but that anthony is totally ru@@ ined now .
just forget about him .
why do you hate him so much ?
i 'll tell you this at least .
this time , it was the cha@@ ir@@ man himself who did it .
what is this ?
we 've saved up some of our wag@@ es you 'd paid us so far .
we know it 's nowhere near the re@@ pay@@ ment amount , but ... writ@@ er lee made the most contribu@@ tion , by the way .
the 20 million you gave me for the script and some of my personal sav@@ ings .
it 's quite a bit . use it for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
represent@@ ative , be strong !
please be strong !
represent@@ ative .
like that would make him strong !
the director 's fee you gave me .
you can pay the interest with the next drama .
director and everybody , listen to me carefully .
do you think i 'll be grateful with this ?
please , just make sure you can look after your own selves first .
did i hear that right ?
don 't worry about it .
a person can@@ not change that easily after all .
so you 're asking me to len@@ d you money ? yes , to tell you the truth , of the 3.4 bil@@ lion of the invest@@ ment , more than half went into your pay@@ ment , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
so , if you could len@@ d the company about half ..
half ?
then , 1 bil@@ lion ?
so , are you asking me to pull out 1 bil@@ lion ?
well , it doesn 't exactly have to be 1 bil@@ lion , but whatever you could chip in ...
stop !
stop !
why should i ?
why should i part with my own blood money ? !
tell me !
our drama is at a crisis right now . we just need to over@@ come this moment of hard@@ ship , so everybody should join our efforts .
the represent@@ ative is running around looking for fun@@ ding by himself .
he may not show it , but he 's going through hell right now .
but then , why are you here to talk about this ?
yes ?
by any chance , do you like anthony ?
what ?
no , i mean , it 's anthony who 's suff@@ ering with no money .
why are you here looking for money .
isn 't that strange ?
my drama is about to be w@@ rec@@ ked , is that so strange ?
besides , if we don 't sec@@ ure enough fun@@ ds , we may never get to see " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ever !
honestly , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " started with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
i 'm aware that 1 bil@@ lion is not an amount that one can easily lent .
however , you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , are like a land@@ mark of this drama .
as the protagon@@ ist of the drama , if you have any affec@@ tion towards " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... "
i beg you .
why is he like that ?
did he really start reading a book and fell asleep ?
it 's not like that .
he 's been like that for a while .
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
what do you think ?
yes ?
about len@@ ding anthony 1 bil@@ lion .
hy@@ ung , are you telling me you 've been thinking about that till now .
are you really thinking of len@@ ding the money ?
i 'm the land@@ mar@@ king of this work , so i should at@@ least think about these things .
land@@ mar@@ king ?
it 's land@@ mark .
hy@@ ung , call anthony .
tell him that i 'll help him . that 1 bil@@ lion won , i 'm deposit@@ ing it soon .
you ?
1 bil@@ lion ?
i 'm also going to try living a little differ@@ ently .
looked like they didn 't have much time , so call him now .
that i 'm sending it soon .
i 'm really calling .
hurry .
yes , represent@@ ative choi .
represent@@ ative kim ?
listen , our hy@@ un min has made a big decision for " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
hy@@ un min made a big decision of what ?
since you were going through a lot of trouble because of the re@@ pay@@ ment of the invest@@ ment ... so our hy@@ un min is thinking about 1 bil@@ lion ... since he 's in lots of trouble , let him just get buried in trouble !
i can 't do this , hy@@ ung , this money means so much to me !
no , no .
i can 't .
that 's what i thought .
you would never help any@@ body with 1 bil@@ lion !
hey , dar@@ n that bastard !
hello represent@@ ative kim ? yes , represent@@ ative choi , tell hy@@ un min , that he should make a big decision about getting ready to sw@@ im in the ocean .
the call wasn 't to len@@ d money but to ask about the sw@@ im@@ ming in the sea scene ?
yes , it 's me .
i know you 're busy but come out for a while .
the same cafe where we used to go often .
i 'll wait until you get here .
who was it ?
what 's the matter ?
i 'm going to run an er@@ rand , prepare a list of potential invest@@ ors outside of the capital .
yes .
see you later .
hy@@ ung , are you crazy ?
you told me to call him !
usually , you do things at the speed of a s@@ nail .
why were you so fast this time ?
you told me to hurry !
will you die if i tell you to die ?
what ?
that was 1 bil@@ lion won of money !
are you doing whatever you want because it is not your money ?
huh ?
do you know it 's been 5 years ?
to be back here where you broke up with me so heart@@ lessly .
that was 5 years ago .
i 'm sorry but i 'm a little busy .
can we just talk about business ?
what will happen if i abandon you now ?
i 'm asking what will happen if i leave this project .
did you call me to tell me you 're done ?
no . so that i won 't leave this project , accept this money .
all i 've got that is avail@@ able right now is just half a bil@@ lion .
for interest , i would like to rece@@ ive your heart .
i guess it would still be difficult .
your dream , i hope you can make it come true . turn around world production into a world class production company like 20@@ th century fox .
world class 20@@ th century fox ... ?
that 's right .
your dream when you worked at empire 5 years ago .
here , this is the place .
we 're going to build the larg@@ est film@@ ing studio in asia .
[ 5 years ago ]
all the fans of kore@@ an dram@@ as from japan , china , other asian coun@@ tries , plus more fans from over 60 different coun@@ tries will be drawn by it .
once we can build a theme park so that it can serve as a tour@@ ist attr@@ action in ad@@ dition to a film@@ ing studio , the prof@@ its we 're cur@@ r@@ ently making from dram@@ as won 't even compar@@ e .
the catch is , we need a master@@ piece that can do it .
could you take charge and do it ?
if you 'd put me in charge , i 'm going to turn this empire into the 20@@ th century fox of dram@@ as !
i want something much bigger .
although i guess the one who so@@ wed the se@@ ed of my big amb@@ ition doesn 't remember .
so it was that .
thank you .
i 'll use the money well .
you 're a real big help .
thank you . once part of the studio is finished , let 's use it for film@@ ing " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
then , the land that was worth 5@@ k won per 35 s@@ q ft will incre@@ ase its value by 5000 % in no time !
pur@@ chase this land no matter the cost !
yes .
so , you came here because you 're interested in my land ?
i 'm interested in the whole lot of 14@@ 3@@ k s@@ q ft that you have .
for over 10 years , nobody has ever sho@@ wn interest in it .
you must have quite a fortune for someone so young .
but i won 't be bu@@ ying it .
what does that mean ?
in a few days , somebody else will come , wanting to buy your land .
he will want to speed up the deal , off@@ ering a slightly higher price than the market .
however , you should never agree to a contr@@ act .
get lost .
who do you think you 're trying to fool ?
i 've seen tons of s@@ cam@@ mers like you in my life !
i 'm sure you have seen many s@@ cam@@ mers like me .
however , you never know .
so what ? if you would believe me , you can make bil@@ lions without even lifting a finger from where you are sitting .
get lost !
i 'll wait for your call .
we can 't af@@ ford to simply wait anymore .
we need to switch to a different production company as soon as possible .
thinks very carefully .
if we don 't do well , we will be removed from our places .
i decided to fight .
is it possible for us to win ?
yes ?
it 's me .
hello .
like you said , somebody came to see me .
he offered more than the market price , wanting to buy the whole 14@@ 3@@ k s@@ q ft .
so what did you do ?
for now , i sent them back .
you did well .
so now , tell me what you want .
what i want is half of the profit you will make .
inv@@ est that money in me .
that is my condition .
( invest@@ ment ? )
will you believe me , and go along with my plan ? i 've even offered to double the market price , yet the land ow@@ ner is being stub@@ born .
he 's stub@@ born ?
yes .
he says he has no thought of s@@ elling the land .
this won 't do .
i 'll have to meet him in person .
seemed like he is great@@ ly att@@ ached to the land his father passed on to him .
it was quite a challenge to even get him to come here , with his age and all .
land passed onto him by his father , huh ?
yes .
that seems to be why he doesn 't want to sell at all .
the old live in the past and are buried in the past .
even so , the old have a future , too .
the future of the old ... ?
it 's their children .
the future of the old is the se@@ eds they have so@@ wn , their children .
like that , even as the old die away , they live the future through their se@@ eds .
i don 't understand what you 're trying to say .
there 's nothing to think so hard about .
in short , the answer is money .
the in@@ herit@@ ance of the past that can gu@@ aran@@ tee a bright future for the children .
nice to meet you .
please take a seat .
i don 't think that 's needed .
just go ahead and talk .
what is the reason that you wanted to see me ?
then , i am sure that he will get to the point right away .
i will pay the triple .
don 't accept that either . the fact that i have absolutely no thought of s@@ elling my land , i thought you were well aware of that .
well , then .
five times ...
i 'll give you five times as much .
please take a seat .
we prepared the contr@@ act .
with the condition that we will pay all the amount until noon by tomorrow .
yes ?
i just came back home after complet@@ ing the contr@@ act .
everything happened as you predic@@ ted .
i will be receiv@@ ing the money at the noon tomorrow .
yes .
i will meet you with the invest@@ ment contr@@ act tomorrow .
k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sung '@@ s@@ morning :
invest@@ ment@@ contr@@ act
what is it ?
president ken@@ ji wants to see you .
i understand .
please let him know that i will see him within today .
president ordered us to bring you .
i am on my way to get the money to return to president .
i 'm sorry but can you move aside .
say that in front of the cha@@ ir@@ man .
we only carry out his orders .
i understand .
hey , get him !
get him !
chase him !
get him !
that way !
can 't you think about it one more time ?
not just one but i thought about this 10 times .
put yourself in my sho@@ e . if you had 10 bil@@ lion , put yourself in my sho@@ e .
if you had 10 bil@@ lion , could you give it away easily ?
i 'm not asking you to give it but len@@ d it .
i 've also had a really hard time getting till here .
honestly , even if i give away 10 bil@@ lions ( $ 1 million ) , it will not be resol@@ ved .
it 's just like pum@@ ping water into a broken cro@@ ck .
how do you know if the cro@@ ck is broken or not ?
then call anthony right now and confir@@ m it .
if anthony could find a single penny , i 'll change my mind then .
hello ?
represent@@ ative ?
represent@@ ative ?
hello ?
represent@@ ative ?
lee go e@@ un , listen carefully to what i say from now on .
if you walk into an al@@ ley back of our company building , there will be an iron gate at the dead end .
what is that about ?
i don 't have time to explain in detail .
behind that gate , there is my bag .
a bag with the contr@@ act , which we need in order to get the invest@@ ment .
if you can 't contact me after@@ wards , that means something happened to me .
then you will have to find the invest@@ or with that bag .
you understand what i 'm saying right ?
yes .
but what 's wrong ?
shouldn 't we contact the police ?
no , it will be too late by then .
just do what i tell you .
before noon today , you must go and see the invest@@ or . then he will take care of the rest .
hello ?
hello !
represent@@ ative .
re@@ p ...
what is it ?
what happened ?
come with me right now .
hurry .
huh ?
hurry .
contr@@ ac@@ to@@ f@@ buy@@ ing@@ and sell@@ ing@@ land . about the land , i have sent the money .
you 've worked hard .
but do you think anthony will easily give up on the piece easily ?
it has nothing to do with anthony 's will now . once tonight is over ,
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' ... .. is ours .
have you come back to your senses ?
what are you thinking of doing captur@@ ing me ?
if you let me go right now , i can bring you back the money right away .
how do i believe in those words ?
do you have an official document that you could prove it ?
if you don 't believe in me , it 's okay if you come together with me .
rather than that , easily ... getting the money back ...
i believe there is a certain way to do it .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sang ... "
leave it to the empire .
at the end , is it this ? with the same purpose as empire , are you going to thre@@ aten me so that you can give my work away to empire ?
all i need is getting my money .
that 's why please make your decision .
it 's whether by giving them " k@@ ye@@ ong@@ sung 's morning , " pay@@ ing me back , or ... give me your hand as you promised .

the promised dead@@ line is tonight at midnight .
as long as you get the money by then , isn 't it good ?
midnight ?
someone will come bring me the money by 12 ?
if only you decide to wait until then .
well , since a promise is a promise . i guess i 'll wait .
until 12 , you have around 3 hours and 10 minutes . before that , someone needs to do it for sure .
so where is this gate and this bag ?
is it even true that if we find the bag , the money can be returned ?
just sh@@ us@@ h and focus on looking !
but i 'm looking for it though .
it 's just that i don 't see it !

i 'm sorry for intr@@ ud@@ ing this late .
i 'm sorry for intr@@ ud@@ ing this late . this is mr. choi p@@ il se@@ ong 's house right ?
yes it is , but he 's not here at the moment .

he went to meet his friends .
he said he would be drinking . he might be a little late .
where is that place ?
why ?
it 's an emergen@@ cy .
we need to see him as soon as possible .
do you have to go this far ?
it was your late father 's wish to have this drama made .
father 's already in the past .
what i 'm interested in is the present and the future .
it 's better you leave this house too .
i dont need any of that past .
what is the matter ?
i 'm here to meet mr. choi p@@ il se@@ ong .
are you one of his party ?
no , it 's not that .
it 's really ur@@ gent . i need to see him as soon as possible .

i 'm sorry to say but your time 's up .
hold on a second . please wait a little more .
let 's start .
life is so full of sur@@ prises !
who 'd have thought that i 'd hit such a jack@@ pot after so many years of dro@@ ught ?
that 's what i 'm saying .
how much did you sell that land for ?
sh@@ us@@ h ! everybody says that you now have the money saved even for your gre@@ at-@@ grand@@ children .

i 've just returned the invest@@ ment fund of 3.4 bil@@ lion won to you .
returned the invest@@ ment fund ?
mr. anthony , you 're one lucky person .
since you kept your promise , you 're free now .
yes , mr. ken@@ ji .
i was in the middle of waiting for your call .
yes ?
what is that about ?
let 's say that the promise between you and me was never made .
what are you trying to say ?
as promised , anthony re@@ pay@@ ed the invest@@ ment money .
that 's not possible .
where are you at the moment mr. ken@@ ji .
i 'll be there .
you don 't need to come here .
anthony .
yes it 's me , anthony .
what kind of trick did you use ?
you shouldn 't speak like that to someone you helped .
what ?
!
i was able to resol@@ ve this thanks to you who pur@@ chas@@ ed choi p@@ il se@@ ong 's us@@ eless land for 5 times more money than it 's worth .
thank you very much .
i 'll make sure the money is used without waste .
anthony !
as you wanted , you became cao cao .
unfortunately , you fell off from the red cliff to the sea of fire , though . whatever it is , con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
anthony !
like this , our problem is over .
we won 't need to see each other again .
anthony !
how dare you take my money ! and mo@@ ck me ?
shit !
thank you very much for keeping your promise .
what have i done here ?
bank@@ ers had to do all the work at this late hour .
from now on our dram@@ a- what was it again ?
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' .
oh right , ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . ' i 'm leaving it to you .
don 't worry about it since korea 's best top stars are in it .
that 's right !
i 'll also be expecting from the top star .
yes , of course .
how was i ?
wasn 't i quite use@@ ful ?
you 're very use@@ ful for your s@@ kill to torture me by making me wait .
yes ?
you 've tor@@ tured me until the very end , but now are you saying you were use@@ ful ?
ah , the old saying is never wrong .
" you saved a dro@@ wning person , but then that person demand@@ s you to bring his bun@@ dle too . "
if you 're going to save a dro@@ wning person , of course , you should save his bun@@ dle too !
i guess you 're fine since you 're all pom@@ p@@ ous like before .
see you tomorrow .
i think i should also say my last far@@ e@@ well .
ms. ak@@ iko , what are you going to do from now on ?
i 'll return back to japan and live like a new person . even though the cha@@ ir@@ man has left , please make a really good drama .
i will also watch it .
why did you hang up without talking about me ?
well , while i was talking to him ... the car taken was mine , the one driving is me and the bag was found because of me .
how big my contribu@@ tion was !
you can 't just ignore it !
oh come on , i 'll tell him about it later .
you definitely have to put in the word how big my help was .
if i say it to him myself , it doesn 't look good .
so writ@@ er lee , you should make sure to mention it to him , got it ?
yes .
we 're almost there .
please turn right here .
turn right .
you 've tor@@ tured me until the very end , but now are you saying you were use@@ ful ?
if you 're going to save a dro@@ wning person , of course you should save his bun@@ dle too !
what were you thinking about that you are gigg@@ ling like that ?
so , you came back alive without being hurt .
thanks to someone .
thanks to someone who was so slow , i was sh@@ it-@@ scared , indeed .
you must have been really scared . ( in in@@ formal spe@@ ach )
don 't talk to me without honor@@ ific@@ s .
i was talking to myself right now .
do i have to use pol@@ ite form even when i 'm talking to myself ?
but ... why did you come ?
thank you .
i came here to say that .
represent@@ ative
if you 're that grateful , do you want to get some beer ?
i don 't like that .
ready ?
action !
how is it ?
how do you feel after watching the film@@ ing of the drama you invest@@ ed in ? the cru@@ ise scene you guys film@@ ed in the morning was spectac@@ ular too , but the passion of that handsome actor . wow !
this is aw@@ esome !
wow !
cut !
towel !
director !
let 's go one more time hy@@ un min .
this is already the 4@@ th time .
can 't you separ@@ ately film me walking out of the water ?
this scene 's key point is the main role kim wo@@ o jin who has went through all diffic@@ ulti@@ es and survi@@ ved from the rough sea !
if we use cu@@ ts , it won 't have the same effect
let 's go for more re@@ alist@@ ic in one shot .
one more for the last time okay ?
that 's right .
you can do it since you 're the best actor .
alright !
let 's go one more time .
from the point kim wo@@ o jin sw@@ im@@ s !
cut !
you can 't be shaking like that !
again !
cut !
what 's with that dog !
you son of a b * t@@ ch !
hey , aren 't you going to control this mut@@ t ?
because of the dog@@ -
cut !
again !
director .
cut !
okay !
it 's a wrap !
hy@@ un min !
you were aw@@ esome !
let 's all give a big round of ap@@ pl@@ aus@@ e for k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
you@@ wer@@ eg@@ re@@ at !
good@@ work !
are you alright hy@@ ung ?
to the car , to the car , hurry .
put on the he@@ ater .
he@@ ater !
he@@ ater !
just watching this is making me cold .
he should experience more hard@@ ships .
even with that , he won 't be able to become a real actor , though .
i guess so ...
represent@@ ative !
the cha@@ ir@@ man is coming this way .
what ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man ?
yes .
he 's on his way with a team of empire 's law@@ yers .
legal team ... ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man is here .
you 're here . from now on , while anthony had been working as the c.@@ e.@@ o. of empire production for 7 years , the lo@@ bb@@ ying fund , der@@ el@@ ic@@ tion of duty or em@@ baz@@ z@@ lement he commit@@ ted , no matter what it is , find anything so that we can prepare to crus@@ h him !
yes ? find any documents about anthony , even if it 's a penny or a single rece@@ ip@@ t , and hand them over to our legal team ! but , considering anthony 's person@@ ality ,
there isn 't ?
if there is@@ nt , then isn 't it your job to make one ?
he 's the bastard who made me throw away my money , 8 bil@@ lion won in the air .
listen well everybody . if you want to keep eating and living with my money , find it no matter what !
no matter what !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
did you really turn up the he@@ ater to the high@@ est ?
yes , hy@@ ung .
are you okay ?
do i look okay ?
hurry up and shut the door . the cold wind is blo@@ wing in .
this is warm coffee .
this will make you feel a little war@@ mer .
that 's why i told you to cut out this scene from the script .
but after coming here and seeing the shoot , i think keeping it was the right decision . i 'm in this state now , but how can you say that ?
you looked so aw@@ esome today , aw@@ esome enough to make all the staff out there fall for you .
was i that cool ?
of course , you were the best !
like brad pit@@ t ?
yes . like brad pit@@ t .
in@@ evit@@ able , huh ?
like brad pit@@ t ?
it 's cold .
it 's been a long time ... since the two of us came to the beach like this .
true .
but ... why did you want to see me ?
to return this .
i 'm than@@ k@@ ful but everything is sol@@ ved .
just keep it .
you know it well , don 't you ?
that we can never know what might happen anywhere , any how .
something like that won 't happen but if it does , i 'll take it . so keep it .
how does it feel having your 3-@@ year old work experien@@ cing its first shoot ?
i don 't feel anything .
just feel like going back to my regular rout@@ ine ?
why ?
other people may not notice , but you can 't fool my eyes .
represent@@ ative , you are extre@@ mely excited with anticip@@ ation right now .
me ?
represent@@ ative , you might be the person with the smal@@ l@@ est understanding of ones@@ elf in the world .
because it has become your ha@@ bit to hide your feelings and forget about yourself .
you 're talking as if you know a lot about me .
is there anything more i need to know ? i 'm sorry but er@@ ase all the memories you 've had with me .
since i 've already er@@ ased mine a long time ago .
i 'm telling you again as the director of the drama department of s@@ bc . all actions you 're making now , please stop them immediately .
so , does that mean that you 're suppor@@ ting anthony more , not me ?
no .
it 's because " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is also my drama .
yes ?
director , the film@@ ing crew finished today 's shooting and they are about to leave for seoul now .
by the way , i was wondering if you are going to atten@@ d tonight 's team dinner .
of course , i should go to that .
yes . i understand .
- what are you doing ?
- oh my god , oh my god ! you scared me to death !
being scared is your concern , but i asked what you were doing . when i 'm feeling really good or when i 'm feeling down , i 'm usually doing this by myself .
if you do this , it makes you feel much fres@@ her .
by closing your eyes like this and rais@@ ing your arms up like wings and start imagin@@ ing .
i 'm free and flying in the sky . underneath me
i see my work place and i also see my mother 's mac@@ ker@@ el restaurant .
just like this after taking a long tour you come down and open your eyes .
it 's the we@@ ir@@ dest stret@@ ch i 've ever seen in my life .
stop doing us@@ eless things and hurry up to leave .
since everyone is waiting because of you .
everyone , attention , please !
today , the head director of the s@@ bc drama department will say something .
hello everyone . the director should have done it .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " finally started its first step . of course , there were many complic@@ ations , but the director , ac@@ tors and all staf@@ fs endu@@ red them all together , so i believe this start was possible . well , a good res@@ ult is too obvious , but during that long journey for the next 4 months ,
i wish no one gets sick and everything goes well . should we make a to@@ ast ?
everyone , raise your glass , please .
if i say , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ... "
what do you say mr. hy@@ un min ?
let 's go with da@@ eb@@ ak .
da@@ eb@@ ak is good .
alright then , ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' is da@@ eb@@ ak .
'@@ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' !
da@@ eb@@ ak !
here , here .
definitely , kore@@ an be@@ ef is different .
these days , kore@@ an far@@ ms are having a lot of diffic@@ ulti@@ es , so we should eat kore@@ an be@@ ef a lot .
what 's up with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , tre@@ ating all the staff with kore@@ an be@@ ef ?
well , that cost@@ s nothing .
you 're really a lot different .
and , i 'm the pr amb@@ ass@@ ador of kore@@ an be@@ ef , so i know well about this kind of thing .
this place 's meat is the best !
be@@ ef will be served as much as you want , so order as much as you want !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min seems to be a better person than what i thought before .
he even knows how to buy for the staff . this isn 't paid for with his own money . it 's a sponsor@@ ship .
what ?
even meat can be spon@@ so@@ red ?
wasn 't he tre@@ ating us because he is the pr amb@@ ass@@ ador of kore@@ an be@@ ef ?
that 's why he gets that sponsor@@ ship .
alright everyone .
our actor , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , is tre@@ ating you huge with this clothing for staff !
well , everyone , take one !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
min ah , you should have one too .
i prepared one for you !
by any chance , these are also ... ?
spon@@ so@@ red . after all , he 's the greatest st@@ ing@@ y actor who never sp@@ ends his own money , even a penny .
wow ! how is it ?
is your il@@ lusion about him now breaking ?
yes , you can speak now .
who did you say you were ?
you 're pretty sh@@ amel@@ ess .
looking at you having so much fun after your the@@ ft .
i don 't know what you mean , but i think you should first say who you are .
i 'm jo young e@@ un , the writ@@ er of nov@@ el " lo@@ vers of destiny . "
so what ?
your drama copi@@ ed my nov@@ el .
i don 't think you don 't know about that .
i don 't know about that , but i know one thing very well .
every time when i make a drama , i get a phone call from people like you .
and whenever that happens , i say like this .
then go ahead .
stop your funny trick and get lost .
unless you want to lose your money for law@@ yer 's fee while trying to get a few penn@@ ies by black@@ ma@@ iling .
represent@@ ative . what are you doing here ?
let 's go in , everyone is waiting .
alright .
hurry .
alright , i 'm going .
well then everyone , was the meat del@@ icious ?
yes !
please go in .
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative ! represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !
everyone !
now is the moment everyone has been waiting for .
we 'll now listen to a song from world production 's represent@@ ative .
i can 't do it so ask someone else .
but still , at@@ least one song .
that 's right represent@@ ative . at@@ least one song .
represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative ! represent@@ ative !
represent@@ ative !

12,000 moun@@ tain@@ to@@ ps we 've missed so much .
although they don 't say a word .

what was that ?
is he upset because we laughed ?
i will change the mood .
new writ@@ er lee go e@@ un will be sing@@ ing .
pd jo@@ o ?
must we use chop@@ st@@ icks well to eat food ?
[ " dance with dj d.@@ o.@@ c " by dj d.@@ o.@@ c. ]
even if we don 't use chop@@ st@@ icks well , we can eat food well !
but when i eat food , people around me always say , " do you have any problem with this table ? "
that was su@@ pris@@ ing .
what was ?
the represent@@ ative that i know wouldn 't be sing@@ ing in front of people .
i guess i was wrong .
i thought i knew a lot about you .
it seems you 've changed .
everyone changes .
is that change because of lee go e@@ un ?
i 'm sorry but you got it completely wrong .
i 'm not someone who changes because of anyone .
even for my change , i choose to change myself .

because i 've also sent the certific@@ ation of cont@@ ents to writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
and you keep saying that i 'm black@@ ma@@ iling you with a silly reason ... no , let me tell you first why that is a silly black@@ mail .
what jud@@ ges and pro@@ secu@@ tors hate the most is this kind of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism case .
all you 've got to do is just sh@@ amel@@ ess@@ ly throw your book at them for review , hoping that that will bo@@ ost the sale of your book and they are stuck with reading the whole pa@@ the@@ tic writing , and even if they do finish reading it , 99.@@ 9 % of the time it ends up being a waste of time .
i don 't think you understand what i 'm saying .
i don 't know how you got your hands on the script of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " when it hasn 't even ai@@ red yet , but we don 't know about your book nor do we need to know about it .
what are you doing ?
this is my problem .
this is ' morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's ' writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
so you are lee go e@@ un ?
let 's meet .
you don 't have to meet .
yes .
yes , i 'll see you there then .
she 's just trying to st@@ ir up contro@@ vers@@ y to sell more copi@@ es of her book .
we 'll only find that out after meeting right ?
i 'll be the one meeting her and taking care of this !
stop wast@@ ing time and just focus on writing your script .
no , this is a problem of me and my pride as a writ@@ er .
i 'll sol@@ ve it myself .
you 're younger than i had thought ... and so ras@@ h .
i don 't think i deserve to hear such words .
look here , ms. lee go e@@ un .
reg@@ ard@@ less of how much you want to get fame and succes@@ s , you shouldn 't ste@@ al someone else 's work and present it as if it is yours .
can you still call yourself a writ@@ er ? ste@@ aling ? i don 't know why you would accuse me like this , but
i haven 't stol@@ en anything . my book ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers ' was publ@@ ished 5 years ago .
'@@ morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' started 6 years ago .
besides , the main stor@@ y@@ line was finished a year before that , in 2005 .
do you have any evidence ?
your work wasn 't even regi@@ ster@@ ed for co@@ py@@ right .
don 't think you can get away with this by lying .
you 're the one being pre@@ poster@@ ous here .
i 'm the one who 's the vic@@ tim here .
vic@@ tim ?
admit to it when i 'm putting it nic@@ ely .
admit that you plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed my work .
no , i will never agree to it since it 's not the truth .
ms. lee go ge@@ un , i 'll make sure that your drama never air@@ s .
i 'll ap@@ ply for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast .
go deal with it . let me tell you one more time ,
i 'm not a writ@@ er that ste@@ als someone else 's work to make a name for myself .
have you read my book ?
you 'll know once you read my book .
excuse me .
i 'm looking for a nov@@ el .
what 's the title ?
f@@ ated lo@@ vers .
[ questions of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism on morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , a drama before air@@ ing has plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed ? ]

w@@ hoa , even ap@@ pl@@ ying for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing our drama broad@@ cast ?
who 's calling the ket@@ tle black ?
i know !
our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un would never plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ize someone else 's work !
she wouldn 't even know that plag@@ i@@ ar@@ izm is sp@@ el@@ led with a p !
how pres@@ um@@ p@@ tu@@ ous of them !
this cho ye@@ ong e@@ un seems like a weird writ@@ er . at any rate , more and more news articles are coming out , and if she 's already started ap@@ pl@@ ying for an in@@ jun@@ ction , this is getting real serious ...
- stop wor@@ rying about it .
what they want is exactly this type of attention from the ignor@@ ant mas@@ ses .
so don 't concern yourself with this and do your work .
i 'll take care of it .
yes !
pd jo@@ o , come see me for while .
yes ! by the way , what exactly is that in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast ? well , when there is a contro@@ vers@@ y of plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , they can make a legal request to the court to stop the drama from being ai@@ red .
then , what if it gets accepted ?
then , the drama won 't get ai@@ red at all .
the drama won 't get ai@@ red ?
but that won 't happen to us , so don 't worry .
go make some coffee now .
yeah , no need to worry . get a copy of " f@@ ated lo@@ vers " and give it to law@@ yer park , and also send him a copy of the drama pro@@ pos@@ al and scrip@@ ts for review .
but .. there 's no way that writ@@ er lee would have plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed .
is it really necessary to do all that ?
we have to be ready to face them , not sit around doing nothing .
i see .
but ...
don 't you think it might be the empire 's doing ?
it 's not the empire .
this is too small of an issue for it to be an attack from them .
[ application for an in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong in progress ]
is this your doing ?
no cha@@ ir@@ man .
of course not , it had better not be you !
if you thought of sto@@ op@@ ing down to such pet@@ ty tr@@ icks like this and st@@ ain my reputation , you 'd be dead , too !
it 's definitely not me cha@@ ir@@ man .
please believe me .
then , fine !
just focus on what i told you to do !
no matter what , we 've got to find some evidence that can put that bastard anthony in ja@@ il !
that 's your top prior@@ ity !
yes , cha@@ ir@@ man .
alright , let 's start .
as you may already know by now , there is a plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y about " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
has anyone read the ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers ' ?
i took a look at it , and it seems that it 's not something that can be over@@ looked .
however , given that they 're both set in the japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation period , some simil@@ ar@@ ities are in@@ evit@@ able .
some parts in the book are indeed similar , i must admit . especially the character of the female protagon@@ ist is the same , so that can be a problem for us .
the problem is what the court will decide . plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism cas@@ es are gener@@ ally ambigu@@ ous , but if the judge deci@@ des that it really is plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , then the drama will be bann@@ ed from broadcasting .
if it comes to that , things will get really serious .
we have to prepare some kind of a counter@@ plan .
who knows if writ@@ er lee go e@@ un really did plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ize her work ?
alright , i understand .
let me first discus@@ s this matter with writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
who is it ?
who is it ?
writ@@ er lee , it 's me . director nam , i surprised you by coming here without calling you right ?
but this way , i can check on you and make sure that you 're working on your script .
can i get a cup of tea ?
yes , sure . come in .
yes .
wow , you 've done quite a bit of background research .
yes .
[ f@@ ated lo@@ vers ]
but still if you had called , i would have prepared something .
no , no need for that .
you must be the bus@@ i@@ est person right now .
a cup of tea is just fine .
i 'll drink it well .
ah@@ h , this is pep@@ per@@ min@@ t flav@@ or .
yes .
are you doing well ?
yes .
i know what you want to tell me .
you 're here because of the plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism issue right ?
is it written on my face ?
it 's not me .
i really didn 't ste@@ al it .
that 's right .
you know , as one gets older , his need@@ less wor@@ ries grow bigger , too .
yes .
writ@@ er lee , you should just concentr@@ ate on writing your script , and i 'll discus@@ s this matter with represent@@ ative kim .
what do you think at@@ tor@@ ney park ? before we get to that , this writ@@ er called lee go e@@ un is she someone trust@@ wor@@ thy ?
why do you ask ?
i think this is going to be a tou@@ gh case . the other party has hi@@ red someone with a good track record with plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism cas@@ es like this , law@@ yer j@@ ang hy@@ un j@@ ae .
at@@ tor@@ ney j@@ ang ?
yes .
the re@@ tain@@ er must be quite hef@@ ty .
this writ@@ er of " f@@ ated lo@@ vers "
has put her fate on the line with this law@@ suit . unless you can provi@@ de some kind of a firm evidence , the in@@ jun@@ ction of bann@@ ing the drama 's broad@@ cast may be gr@@ ant@@ ed .
[ morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , a drama before air@@ ing in a plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y ? ] as you had asked ,
i 've brought all the ac@@ coun@@ ting records of production bud@@ gets of the dram@@ as that anthony had produc@@ ed while he was working in empire .
okay .
good work .
oh , right . about that plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism contro@@ vers@@ y of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , "
you didn 't have a hand in it , did you , director heo ?
i did meet with the writ@@ er and introduc@@ ed law@@ yer choi and media repor@@ ters to her .
law@@ yer choi is pretty good in that area . director heo , is this the time to work on something so pet@@ ty ?
were you thinking of tar@@ n@@ ishing my reputation with such a pa@@ the@@ tic trick ?
!
i 'm sorry .
shall i stop them , then ?
no .
just leave it . however ,
i didn 't hear about this .
understand ?
yes .
if you understand , then leave . if the reason for calling me is about the plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism issue with ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , ' then don 't worry about it since i 'm taking care of it .
you know , sometimes , i en@@ vy your attitude of always making such bold stat@@ ements in full confidence .
let me ask you one thing .
this time , does that firm confidence of yours come from your trust in writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ? there is only one thing i believe in , that ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's ' first broad@@ cast will be ai@@ red on november 5@@ th .
it 's only that .
i know there should be a back@@ -up cd with a saved copy somewhere ... ah , em@@ ail .

[ director go@@ o ]
yes , director . writ@@ er lee , is the writing going well ? is the writing going well ?

you might have to come here for a while .

it 's the scenes that we 're shooting today .
we 're shooting in the studio right now .
if you could come , i 'd really appreciate it .
yes , i understand .
excuse me , director .
can we get something to eat since i 'm really hungry .
aig@@ oo . we can@@ not have our actor hungry .
alright then , we 'll take a 30 minute break .

is it bad ?
yes .
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
i don 't know about others but lee go e@@ un would never do something like that .
if it was plag@@ i@@ ariz@@ ed , it was the other writ@@ er that did it !
it must be right ? if i think about it , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is right .
new noir with no melo@@ drama . if we were to do something like that book , " f@@ ated lo@@ vers , " i would have had to hold , hug , and even kiss that bi * * * of sung min ah !

he 's still got a long way to go , though .
if he 's going to match sung min ah 's acting .

i 've got to make sure that you 're not out of practice , director go@@ o .
is that so ?
sure , watch me carefully and judge for yourself if i 'm out of practice or not .
i guess it 's break time ?
yeah , while we 're shooting , min ah said she had something to talk with writ@@ er lee .
writ@@ er lee ?
she wants some of her lines changed .
i heard that writ@@ er lee just got here .
it may take some time for you to wit@@ ness my no@@ t-@@ so-@@ ou@@ t-@@ of-@@ practice skil@@ ls in direc@@ ting .
we can wait .
you 're here .
yes .
i heard that you wanted me to ad@@ just a few lines .
please have a sit .
ah , yes .
what 's the matter with all these lines ?
what are you talking about ?
director , it seems they forgot to turn off the mike .
no leave it .
let 's hear what they 're talking about .
we have nothing special to do anyway .
never mind . episode 1 , scene 43 , the four@@ th ... g@@ wang so@@ o , isn 't that the voice of sung min ah and writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
hy@@ ung , i guess the micro@@ phone isn 't turned off .
it 's not only that .
you 're asking me to change this now ?
yes .
the lines that are under@@ lined all need to be changed so that we can start shooting right away .
there 's no way i can act with those lines .
seriously sung min ah , don 't you think you 're over doing it ?
even though i 'm a new writ@@ er ...
it 's not that . unless you want to be bran@@ ded as a plag@@ ir@@ iz@@ er for the rest of your career , change them .
what is it that you want to say right now ?
you should know it very well .
i 'm sure you 've read the book ' f@@ ated lo@@ vers . '
looking at your expression , i guess you did read it .
how was it ? the character of the female protagon@@ ist , similar lines , is it just me who 's seeing the simil@@ ar@@ ities ?
tell me , is it just me who 's seeing it ?
i saw it too .
i acknow@@ ledge the fact that there are simil@@ ar@@ ities .
turn off the mic . i didn 't see it before , but were you such a sh@@ amel@@ ess person from the beginning ? even though the two works are similar ,
i didn 't ste@@ al it . ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' is something i wrote with my own strength .
how should i believe that ?
it 's true ! there are similar lines because the sett@@ ings are similar , and that 's because it 's set in the japan@@ ese colon@@ iz@@ ation period ...
do you think that 's a vali@@ d excuse ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .
didn 't you admit it .
i heard it all because the mic was on .
writ@@ er lee
i 'm really disap@@ pointed . whatever the case , start changing these .
with these lines , as long as my name is involved , i can 't act .
you have to .
what ... did you just say ?
i 'm telling you to follow this script without trying to change it .
represent@@ ative kim .
no matter what , we have to get the drama ai@@ red on the sched@@ ul@@ ed date .
plus i have one request .
don 't call out the writ@@ er and dem@@ and for any change in the script from now on .
what are you doing not working on your script ?
getting the drama ai@@ red is important , but my inno@@ cen@@ ce is important to me , too .
in order to take care of the in@@ jun@@ ction on bann@@ ing the broad@@ cast , yes , both are important .
at the end , even you don 't believe me .
yes , i do . i may not believe any@@ body in this world ,
i may not even believe in myself sometimes , but that me belie@@ ves in you .
next week on king of dram@@ as . everybody , i am the represent@@ ative of the production company , anthony kim .
this " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " that we are all working on should not become a drama of distr@@ ust .
the truth that " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is wh@@ ol@@ ly created by our writ@@ er and that it is our righ@@ t@@ ful drama , writ@@ er lee go e@@ un and i vou@@ ch for it .
nay , we have to believe it .
and we will prove that truth .
mean@@ while , we need to continue shooting " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ! "
episode 11 line of life and i may not trust anyone in the world , and sometimes i don 't trust even myself , but i , such a person like that ... trust you . but this matter will not be resol@@ ved with that .
if even you felt these two pieces similar , you must prove that you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " earlier ( than that nov@@ el ) . pro@@ ving that you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " by yourself should be the top prior@@ ity . with that , get acknow@@ led@@ ged about your sin@@ cer@@ ity by other people too .
director , it 's me . ah , yes . please turn on the micro@@ phone again .
micro@@ phone ?
turn on the micro@@ phone .
everyone , i 'm anthony kim , the represent@@ ative of the production company .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " which you guys are making now must not become a piece of distr@@ ust .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is sol@@ ely the creation made by our writ@@ er and us .
not only writ@@ er lee go e@@ un but i gu@@ aran@@ tee that fact .
no , we must believe that !
and i will prove that truth .
instead , " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ song " must keep being film@@ ed .
that 's all i want to say .
there@@ fore , please act without any doubt . even so , if you still can 't trust this script , then trust me and act for that role .
to air our drama without any problem , we need some solid proof to show you wrote " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " first .
and we should sub@@ mit that proof to the court by the day after tomorrow , wed@@ nes@@ day .
that nov@@ el@@ ist said she wrote her first draft in 2006 , right ?
yes .
then , we just need to find the file which you wrote earlier than 2006 . i know that , but ...
but ? it was a long time ago , so although i looked for it everywhere , i couldn 't find it .
then , what about e-@@ mail ?
i had , but again , since it was a long time ago , every record back then had been er@@ ased . i 've also contac@@ ted some people in that site , but he said it can 't be re@@ sto@@ red .
then , what about another computer ?
have you ever worked with another computer , not your current lap@@ top ?
other than my lap@@ top ?
yes , other than your lap@@ top .
teacher je@@ ong ? ( writ@@ er je@@ ong ) in the lap@@ top of writ@@ er je@@ ong hong jo@@ o 's studio , which i 'd used when i was her assistant , there might be my file left .

of course !

honey ..
you should inst@@ all a new door@@ lock now .
you know that , right ?
of course .
that 's right .
what are doing not looking for it ?
yes .
i found it !
no , i trust you .
i may not trust anyone in the world , and may not even trust myself ,
but i .. trust you .
see i told you ! / i
doesn 't it feel better coming out ?
i just came with you since you looked so nervous for your debut .
let 's leave after a while .
i 'm not nervous at all .
you don 't believe me ?
i don 't believe in anyone .
sometimes , i don 't trust myself either .
but there 's one thing i have the ultimate trust in .
and that is how you will be the nation 's , no the world 's top star .
don 't tell me you use those words to se@@ du@@ ce women ?
now you seem more like a woman .
later , act with your feeling now .
it will be hel@@ p@@ ful .
it 's not here .
the file i last saved was in 2011 .
i guess everything was er@@ ased and new@@ ly saved again .
we don 't need to wait and see any longer . well , in front of the ac@@ tors and staff , the writ@@ er came forward and admitted that .
even if it 's a bit late , we should prepare the re@@ placement now .
but is it really true that writ@@ er lee admitted that herself ? since sung min ah pushed and asked her , she said that it 's true that those two pieces are similar .
that 's what i heard .
they seemed similar to each other even when i read them . i will sub@@ mit these materi@@ als to the court as evidence , but with only these ,
i can 't gu@@ aran@@ tee the res@@ ult .
in the worst case scenario , the in@@ jun@@ ction to prohi@@ bit the air@@ ing of the drama , will be appro@@ ved .
when is the sub@@ mission of evidence due ?
it 's by midnight today .
pd jo@@ o .
yes , represent@@ ative .
contact that nov@@ el@@ ist .
tell her i want to meet her before that due time .
par@@ don ?
what are you going to do when you meet her ?
she won 't accept any deal for sett@@ lement .
even if i have to kne@@ el down or beg her , i should do whatever i can .
even if we have to put her name as the writ@@ er of the original story , the drama must be ai@@ red .

why ?

you must be nervous because the first broad@@ cast day is coming up .
yeah , it must be .
aig@@ oo .. aig@@ oo , why are you crying like a fool ? at your element@@ ary school liter@@ ary con@@ test , you said that it was embarras@@ sing when i was crying .
did i say that ?
that 's right . the award certific@@ ate you won that day , the hand@@ -@@ cr@@ af@@ ted paper father 's day car@@ nation , and the di@@ ary you wrote in saying you 'd become a great writ@@ er .. i still have all those things .
why have you kept them still ?
do you think that 's all ?
while you were in high school , you wrote me a letter saying you were going to leave the house .. after fin@@ ishing ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' , you even gave me that plastic thing telling me you 'd show me the first .
i still have that too .

ah ..
was your name anthony from the very beginning ?

no such thing .
my name was anthony from the day i was born .
how can there be anthony in a kore@@ an name ?
what do your parents think ?
i never asked them .
then call them and ask them .
they both passed a long time ago .
you don 't need to feel sorry since i 'm not concerned in any way .
then should i give you a kore@@ an name ?
what would be good ?

kim ..
ah !

kim bong dal .
aye , why is he saying that ?
kim bong d ... no fre@@ aking way !
anthony is kim bong dal ... that 's his real name !
aw@@ esome ...
for real ?
excuse me .
you said you didn 't have a kore@@ an name .
kim bong dal .
i wonder if that 's an american name too .
kim bong ..
dal ~ ?
don 't laugh .
i 'm sorry , but the name is so ir@@ resist@@ ible .
kim as in kim@@ chi , bong as in bon@@ gos , [ bong means mountain top ]
dal as in dallas .
[ dal means the moon . ]
it 's so funny !
i 'm sorry but ...
it 's too funny ! kim@@ chi ... bon@@ g@@ wo@@ ori ( meaning " mountain peak " ) ,
dal@@ de@@ onge@@ e ( meaning " round face like the moon " ) . so , november 4@@ th is our kim bong dal 's birthday .
yes , the door is not locked .
yes ...
you 're surprised , aren 't you ?
it 's just a joke !
oh , oh my ... i 'm sorry .
you must have been so surprised .
i thought it was someone else .
not at all .
would you like to come in ? i guess you 've been writing the script , so i 'm afraid if i 'm interrup@@ ting now .
not at all . please have a seat .
i don 't have anything but coffee , is that okay ?
yes .
what brought you here ?
i came to apologi@@ ze .
i 'd like to apologi@@ ze sin@@ cer@@ ely .
mis@@ understanding about your script , that was my mistake .
no , i understand why you mis@@ understood . when i read that book ,
i also thought that different people could come up with similar ideas .
if you think in that way , i 'm than@@ k@@ ful .
but , there 's something i was curious about .
what 's the relationship between you and represent@@ ative ?
was my question a bit odd ?
i was curious about that from the beginning . anthony kim , the previ@@ ous represent@@ ative of empire production , isn 't a person who would wag@@ er everything he has on a new@@ bie writ@@ er 's drama .
what 's up with you two ?
no , there is nothing between the two of us , what do you mean , " relationship " ?
i totally hate a man with that kind of style .
what kind of women in the world would like a man like him ? well , if we must put the word " relationship , " " relationship " of a demon and an angel ?
par@@ don ?
just ... a vic@@ ious represent@@ ative of drama production company and an angel@@ -@@ like writ@@ er ?
something like that ?
but why are you asking that ?
no .
from now on , all of us must run for the high@@ est rat@@ ing of the first episode of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " on november 5@@ th !
yes !
how are our compet@@ it@@ ors of other broadcasting stations going now ?
cur@@ r@@ ently , " return of the king " of k broadcasting is running as the number one in rat@@ ings .
followed by " between lo@@ vers " of m broadcasting in the second .
then , what about s broadcasting ?
its drama is in last with one dig@@ it rat@@ ing ( under 10 % ) .
i don 't think we can get any advantage from the previ@@ ous drama 's rat@@ ing .
last tu@@ es@@ day 's rat@@ ing was 6.@@ 2 % .
it was the worst .
it seems we will have a hard fight .
of course it will be hard , but no matter what , we will win .
from the day when anthony took the position of represent@@ ative to 2009 when he re@@ signed , these are ac@@ coun@@ ting frau@@ d books and the lo@@ bb@@ ying list which used the money from that ac@@ coun@@ ting frau@@ d .
all of them were instruc@@ ted by you , cha@@ ir@@ man , but all ac@@ coun@@ ts and trans@@ actions were done under the name of anthony .
other than that , he didn 't ste@@ al even a single penny from my money ?
yes .
that 's un@@ expected .
well , with these , he would be rot@@ ting in a prison for at least 10 years .
contact our legal team and let them proce@@ ed .
yes .
yes , pd kim .
i called you because i heard our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " will be introduc@@ ed at your " entertainment tonight . "
yes , yes .
then , please take good care of that .
i 've sent the revis@@ ed script for episode 7 .
mr. kim .
bong .
dal .
yes , mom .
hey , we have big trouble .
come quickly to our restaurant .
what 's going on ?
can 't you see ?
there are so many custom@@ ers here !
a@@ igo ...
i can 't do this by myself !
mom !
is that big trouble ?
of course , it is !
top star , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is visit@@ ing here himself !
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
why are you here ?
why ?
to promo@@ te writ@@ er lee 's " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " i 'm here .
they are from my fan club .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
k@@ ang hy@@ un min !
- everyone !
- yes ! this person is the beautiful writ@@ er of our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
- writ@@ er lee .
- yes .
please say something . please say something . please say something .
huh ?
ah ... yes ...
hello !
i 'm writ@@ er lee go e@@ un .
nice to meet you all .
our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong "
will be ai@@ red soon .
there are not many days left until its first episode .
please promo@@ te our drama a lot .
our " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " and here mr@@ .@@ k@@ ang hy@@ un min , no , from now on , kim wo@@ o jin ( the role 's name ) , you will give lots of love to them , right ?
yes !
but , seriously , why are you here ?
i 'm sorry for mis@@ understanding your drama , writ@@ er lee .
i thought that apologi@@ z@@ ing with only words wouldn 't be enough .
so , you want to apologi@@ ze with money and your fans ?
because i have nothing but only money and fans !
then , i will get going for film@@ ing now .
again , sorry ! see you later !
goodbye !
yes , represent@@ ative ?
you want me to am@@ end all of the script for episode 7 ?
not all of them but scene 42 and scene 43 with that cl@@ um@@ sy melo@@ drama part .
clu@@ m ... cl@@ um@@ sy ?
it even has the kiss scene of the main two charac@@ ters , but where do you mean is it cl@@ um@@ sy ?
writ@@ er lee , when you kiss a man , are you doing it in this way ?
huh ?
no , i mean , have you ever kissed a man ?
i have !
then , do it .
what ?
!
in my eyes , the kiss scene in scene 43 gives only the feeling of two wooden st@@ icks hit@@ ting each other .
so , i 'm telling you to try it yourself , writ@@ er lee .
par@@ don ?
pd jo@@ o , read out loud scene 43 .
well , everyone , let 's see .
scene 43 , inside of modern club . sad piano music is filling the empty club ,
kim wo@@ o jin is sitting alone in front of the piano and playing it .
at this moment , with ti@@ p-@@ tap , ti@@ p-@@ tap sound of high heels , a woman appro@@ aches wo@@ o jin .
what are you doing ?
i told you to try it yourself .
even if wo@@ o jin sensed h@@ ye rin coming near him , he doesn 't stop playing . h@@ ye rin grab@@ s his hand .
wo@@ o jin stop@@ s playing the piano .
h@@ ye rin spe@@ aks . " from now on , your playing piano , can you do it only for me ? "
wo@@ o jin st@@ ays still , not taking his eyes off the piano .
h@@ ye rin spe@@ aks .
" even if i lie to you , even if i .... even if i betr@@ ay you , i 'm asking if you can play the piano , only for me . "
" no . " after that , wo@@ o jin stands up , staring at h@@ ye rin , and kisses her ?
even that dum@@ b k@@ ang hy@@ un min won 't be able to grab sung min ah and kiss her !
i 'm not an act@@ ress , though !
a writ@@ er is supposed to write to make ac@@ tors act !
if you feel so w@@ ron@@ ged , then go ahead , ask these male vie@@ wers what they think .
that 's why you should rev@@ ise it . i don 't think it 's because you don 't like melo@@ dram@@ as , but because you can 't write them . pd jo@@ o , contact the assistant director and tell him scene 42 and scene 43 will be revis@@ ed , so he should proce@@ ed with the other scenes ' film@@ ing , except for those scenes .
the reason ...
don 't ask me why .
what i can do for you is ...
cut !
ng !
min ah , this is already the four@@ th ng . it 's not a difficult line , but what 's wrong ?
i 'm sorry , director .
then , let 's take a 10-@@ minute break !
we will res@@ ume after 10-@@ minute break !
what are you doing , being so chil@@ dish ?
then , what about you , miss sung min ah ?
you chil@@ dis@@ h@@ ly doub@@ ted writ@@ er lee , but have you apologi@@ z@@ ed to her ?
what 's that with today 's film@@ ing ?
if you hum@@ ili@@ ated a person public@@ ly , shouldn 't you offici@@ ally apologi@@ ze to her in front of all of them ?
i apologi@@ z@@ ed to her offici@@ ally , so please , stop that mor@@ onic act .
mo ~ ron !
mor@@ onic act ?
that 's right ! you will keep experien@@ cing that ! this k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's reven@@ ge , it 's season one , two , three , four !
it will be continued !
hy@@ ung , have you read the script for episode 7 ?
why ?
the revision has been made from episode 1 , so the melo@@ drama line starts so@@ oner too .
is that so ?
there is even a kiss scene with miss sung min ah .
what ?
kissing scene ?
yeah .
but as per the assistant director , it will be revis@@ ed .
represent@@ ative , then , we will go home now .
okay , you 've worked hard today .
since tomorrow is our first air date , have a good sleep tonight .
you will need to run around all day , tomorrow .
yes , i understand !
we will leave , then .
scene # 43 , inside of modern club .
what ?
i can 't even kiss ?
should i experience a kiss to write well about a kiss scene ?
then , what about a story about a ser@@ ial killer ? its writ@@ er should be a ser@@ ial killer ?
how absur@@ d it is ...
hello .
excuse me ... ah , because of that damn kim bong dal , i can 't focus on the right feeling .
kim bong dal 's birthday !
what is it ?
didn 't you go home ?
i have some business to do with you , represent@@ ative .

that 's what i 'm saying !
ge@@ ez . maybe today isn 't his birthday .
that 's weird , because i heard it clearly .
maybe he had something bad earlier .

no .
what are you sorry for ?

10 seconds .
5@@ seconds 4,@@ 3 , 2 , 1 start ! 4,@@ 3 , 2 , 1 start !
we have a start with 7.1 %
not a great start .
what do we do ? it 's been 30 minutes , and it 's at 6.@@ 8 % .
we 're still the low@@ est .
where are you going ?
it 's still in the middle of the broad@@ cast !
it 's all over .
it 's only been 30 minutes since the show started .
half an hour has passed already and the rat@@ ing is in the p@@ its .
we have lost .
in total mis@@ ery .
so you 're here .
that 's why i told you . we need to go for melo@@ drama , not noir .
aj@@ um@@ mah , can i get a glass here , too ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm going to drink too .

oh my !
15.@@ 7 !
this is aw@@ esome !
we 've hit it off big !

jack@@ pot !
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
this is just the beginning .
aw@@ esome !
we 're first !
15.@@ 7 %
- 15.@@ 7 % - thanks , lord !
yes ?
15.@@ 7 % ?
first ?
oh my !
yes , what did i tell you ?
didn 't i tell you ' morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ' would be a succes@@ s ?
i 'm anthony after all .
where are you going ?
i should go work on the script with this energy !
forget the script , tonight you should drink !
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes , i understand .
finally the era of k@@ ang hy@@ un min has started .
conqu@@ er korea , then japan , china , taiwan , and then the whole world !
didn 't i tell you we 'd definitely be succes@@ s ?
t@@ ch !
don 't you remember what you just said a while ago ?
what did i tell you ?
we shouldn 't have gone with noir .
when did i ?
at any rate , i think this is mean@@ ing@@ ful in so many different ways .
especially that we got the high@@ est rat@@ ing with a genre that hadn 't been attemp@@ ted in korea before . of course , the produc@@ er 's eye in dis@@ cer@@ ning the right script was especially cru@@ cial .
what about the prom@@ ising writ@@ er 's writing skil@@ ls with ten@@ ac@@ ity ?
you sure are a prom@@ ising writ@@ er , but you still have a long way to go .
at any rate , a drama writ@@ er needs to know how to write good melo@@ drama .
nothing like that pa@@ the@@ tic kissing scene .
that talk again ! tell me tru@@ th@@ fully , you 've never had a kiss right ?
that of cour@@ s-
you haven 't felt your heart beating for a man .
i 've felt it before .
not just a chil@@ dish crus@@ h .
i 've definitely ,
you 've definitely not experienced that .
seriously , aren 't you drinking a little too much ?
you were already drinking before i came here .
i 'm anthony .
mere alcohol can 't defe@@ at me .
pd jo@@ o , where are you ?
eh ?
soo@@ won ?
it 's nothing .
well , it 's just ... no , never mind .
ah man , ah , dar@@ n !
mere alcohol what ?
can 't defe@@ at me ?
seriously !
i guess ... it 's my fault ... for drinking with him .
sleep well . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
don 't ever drink again !
what do you think about me ?
yes ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
see you tomorrow ~ pre@@ view so what you two are saying right now ..
.. is that you have a problem with the kiss scene in episode 7 ? that 's right .
you are under ar@@ rest for professional neg@@ li@@ gence and mis@@ appropri@@ ation of fun@@ ds .
exactly why do you hate me so much ?
i 'll kill you .
stop sab@@ ot@@ ag@@ ing the production of " morning in k@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ ong , " al@@ read !
please ! how dare you order me around ?
if you 've got a nice lady friend , you can bring her to me .
i 'll show you when i find one .
what have you been doing all those years without ever dating a boyfriend ?
how i hate him , hate him .
the mother of mr. kim bong dal is seriously ill .
mo , mother ?
mom !
mom !
episode 12 no enemy is permanent how do you think of me as a man ? well ...
this is called " melo@@ drama . " this heart@@ beating , flut@@ tering , this is " melo@@ drama " right there ! so , now , go and rev@@ ise that melo@@ drama scene .
what was that ? that scared me ... what kind of human being is he ?
seriously !
what do you think about me ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
what man ?
but why couldn 't i say no at that moment ?
no .
that was because i was to@@ yed in a flash .
that 's right .
crazy bong dal ...
so embarras@@ sing !
who is it ?
who is it ?
it 's me .
what 's this ?
what is he doing here ?
why are you here ?
i have something to say , so open the door first .
what do you have to say ?
you didn 't answer me before .
huh ?
how do you think of me as a man ?
i 'm thinking of you in this way .
oh , that was a relief . ( because it was a dream . )
what 's a relief ?
what time do you think it is now that you 're still in bed ?
since when have you been here ?
since a little while ago .
when i came in , you were pa@@ wing the air as if you were a tur@@ tle which was flipped over .
even if you are the produc@@ er , how could you come in a female writ@@ er 's studio though@@ t@@ lessly ?
this is a writ@@ er 's studio paid by my money and opened by me .
but that writ@@ er didn 't even answer the phone call and didn 't show any reaction to the door because she was too busy sleeping .
so , what else can i do , then ?
if you need to sleep that much , do you think you can survive in this drama industry ?
why did you come ?
hurry and rev@@ ise the melo@@ drama scene of episode 7 and send it to us .
we need to film that scene on this thur@@ s@@ day .
i will rev@@ ise that scene !
do it quickly ! well !
get out !
even if you don 't tell me to go , i will leave .
and from now on , even if you 're sleeping , when i call you , answer it .
because i don 't want to see you pa@@ wing the air when i 'm so busy .
ah , seriously ... " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " from the first episode , w@@ ins mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day .
wo@@ o hoo ~ " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " from the first episode , w@@ ins mon@@ day@@ -@@ tu@@ es@@ day .
" k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's char@@ is@@ ma was shining . "
" indeed , it was k@@ ang hy@@ un min , just like everybody said . "
[ sung min ah , her come@@ back drama after 3 years shows its signal of succes@@ s . "
min ah , what are you doing ?
oh , you 're here .
what ?
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " the pion@@ eer of new drama genre . " cat@@ ching two birds and great harmon@@ y between a vet@@ eran director and a new@@ bie writ@@ er .
" writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i 've never heard of her name , but she 's the best ! " " even if she 's a new@@ bie , her writing is aw@@ esome ! "
then , let 's proce@@ ed with it accor@@ d@@ ng@@ ly .
you 've worked hard ! you 've work hard . well , and this one has not only a good rat@@ ing , but also the reaction ( from the vie@@ wers ) is really great .
it went so vir@@ al . this drama hit the jack@@ pot , jack@@ pot !
did it ? well , i think , our writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , don 't you think we should start manag@@ ing her ? ( meaning " keeping her " )
do you know what people on the internet say about lee go e@@ un ?
they say " the next writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un ( one of the best kore@@ an drama writ@@ ers ) . "
i think we should give her at least a present or something .
what kind of present do you think would be good ?
- a present ?
- yes !
cp lee .
- let 's calm down a little bit , please .
- calm down ?
i will leave now .
so , not a present , but calm down ?
hello ?
is this writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ?
yes . who is it ?
hello .
this is reporter kim e@@ un he@@ e from wo@@ o ri daily new@@ sp@@ aper .
i called you because i 'd like to have an interview .
interview ?
with whom ?
with you , writ@@ er lee .
you want to have an interview with me ?
yes , reporter kim .
yes .
but , can i pick the place ? ( to have an interview )
is there any special reason you picked this place ?
yes .
because " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " started from this place .
- here ?
- yes .
when i was living here , i came up with its idea and wrote its first draft .
then , this is the most perfect place to have an interview with you , writ@@ er lee . after the first episode of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " was ai@@ red , its reaction ( from the vie@@ wers ) was very good .
who is the first one you think of or you are grateful of ?
of course it 's my mom , mrs. park k@@ ang ja .
if it weren 't for my mom , i wouldn 't have been able to write again .
- your mother ?
- yes .
oh , and there is one more person .
who else ? even if that person has really bad person@@ ality and is heart@@ less , because this guy made me go through so much hard@@ ship , but if it weren 't that person , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " couldn 't have been born .
who is that person ?
mr. kim bong dal .
how does it feel to be outside ?
it has been a while since you had fresh air .
i feel so good .
i can hear the sound of spring coming , too .
the sound of spring coming ?
for spring to come , we still have to wait for a long time . like the sound of spring coming ,
i can hear the sound of some welcome guest coming .
that drama was really enjo@@ y@@ able .
if you think it 's enjo@@ y@@ able , then it 's really enjo@@ y@@ able .
it 's rat@@ ing is really good , too .
you 've worried a lot , haven 't you ?
me ?
no .
from the beginning , i knew it would be succes@@ s@@ ful .
whatever your son makes will be the best , so don 't worry at all . don 't work too hard like that , and if you have a good girl , you should show her to me , too . even if i can 't see her , if i hear her voice ,
i will be able to know how good a woman she is .
if i have , i will show her to you , then .
um@@ m .. for a while , even if you 're busy , please come visit her often .
even though she doesn 't show it , her condition has been quite bad these days .
yes , i understand .

i really came just to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you .
i said it 's alright .
what is it this time ?
about the kiss scene ...
isn 't it rather awkward ?

i 'm working on a revision anyway ,
oh really !
of course !
i knew it !
seriously , didn 't i tell you that there 's no need to worry , g@@ wang so@@ o ? i mean , i was ok , but he was losing sleep over it because he was worried for me , so my heart beat went be@@ ep .

okay .
i can see you 're dro@@ ol@@ ing .
by the way , that person , i 've never seen her before .
she is the new f@@ d .
ah , f@@ d ... [ meet writ@@ er lee go e@@ un of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " the new drama in the news . ]
.... " and she expres@@ sed her grat@@ itude to mr. kim bong dal as well . " represent@@ ative , the photo of writ@@ er lee looks really great , doesn 't it ?
well , just so-@@ so .
by the way , who do you think would be that kim bong dal ?
who knows .
but , isn 't his name so funny ?
these days , people don 't use such a rust@@ ic name .
kim bong dal ... ?
koo he@@ e j@@ ae .
yes .
don 't concern about other people 's names , and do your job driving proper@@ ly .
yes .
in a situation of diver@@ gent love , they 're kissing ...
kiss ... by grabbing her hand , wo@@ o jin stop@@ s her from leaving .
how do you think of me as a man ?
the door is not locked .
ah , one sec ...
what is that ?
that dum@@ b expression ?
what 's wrong with my expression ?
aren 't you curious ?
about what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
the rat@@ ing for episode 2 , i mean .
ah , how was it ?
16.@@ 2 % . we 're still the high@@ est , but with the second high@@ est , the difference is only 0.8 % , so don 't lo@@ osen up yet .
yes .
did you rev@@ ise that kiss scene ?
yes , of course .
how is it ?
it 's okay .
from now on , do it well on your own .
par@@ don ?
what have you done so far , not having dat@@ ed anyone ?
well , i guess no man would stick around to put up with all your bad tem@@ per .
ah , from now on , if you 're grateful , say it to me person@@ ally .
don 't beat around the bush by saying it to a reporter .
ge@@ ez , that guy ...
he really makes me not like him .
does it hurt a lot ?
yes , it hur@@ ts craz@@ ily .
is that wen@@ ch crazy ?
what face does she think she de@@ als with ... seriously ...
op@@ pa .
huh ? your cheek went in further , so your chin looks even longer .
what ?
no ... sung min ah , this fo@@ x-@@ like wen@@ ch !
by the way , hy@@ ung .
what ? i received the revis@@ ed script , but its kiss scene seems even stronger now .
what ?
... " kisses her . "
op@@ pa !
you said there is no kiss scene !
kw@@ ang so@@ o .
get ready with the car .
par@@ don ?
where are you going ?
are you asking that because you don 't know ? so , when they said it would be revis@@ ed , they meant that she 's writing the kiss scene better .
with that mor@@ on ?
give me the phone .
" the number you called isn 't avail@@ able at the moment ... " then , about the fun@@ ds he sn@@ uck out , are you saying you have no knowledge , mr. oh jin wan ?
yes .
i had no knowledge of it . sun@@ ba@@ en@@ im , why don 't you tell him the truth ?
all that money , what did you do with that ?
pro@@ secu@@ tor .
chief pro@@ secu@@ tor wants you to call him .
i got it .
let 's take a short break .
what on earth do you think you 're doing now ?
as if you don 't know .
you would know well that i wouldn 't die alone .
where and when i used that money , do you want me to sp@@ ill it all out ?
try it , then .
because i 've already got rid of all evidence of that money being used for lo@@ bb@@ ying .
and there is no evidence it was done by cha@@ ir@@ man 's instruction .
what we have are only the traces of trans@@ actions of all that money in your bank account .
why on earth ... do you hate me so much ?
if this is because of all hum@@ ili@@ ation i 've given you ...
hum@@ ili@@ ation ...
no .
you wouldn 't know how it feels even if you came back from death . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
director oh , director oh ... even if i was called so s@@ ick@@ ly and treated even less than a bug , such things can still be er@@ ased . however , because your bul@@ ls * * t@@ ting philoso@@ phy that you should even abandon your father for a drama ,
as long as that moment , that memory re@@ mains in my brain , you ...
i 'm going to kill you .
well , then , let 's stop this cros@@ s-@@ examin@@ ation .
you can go back now .
wait . where do you think you 're going ?
for der@@ el@@ ic@@ tion of duty and em@@ bez@@ z@@ lement , you 're arrest@@ ed without war@@ rant . until the war@@ rant is appro@@ ved , for the next 48 hours , you can 't leave this office , not even a step . ah , these days , because of that guy , i had a big head@@ ache , but thanks to you , i 'm relieved now .
yes , please take good care of this case .
yes .
arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant ?
why is that all of a sudden ?
that 's why you should have min@@ ded your behavi@@ ors .
i asked you why !
can 't you tell just by looking at this ?
you 're in a serious bin@@ d right now .
even if you had to part ways with him , you shouldn 't have done that to your superior .
hey , kim jo@@ o y@@ ong !
it 's been a while .
yes , what 's going on ?
oh , end@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ year ga@@ thering ? well , actually , cur@@ r@@ ently , at my district pro@@ secu@@ tor 's office , the represent@@ ative of the production company of one of your dram@@ as has been arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant .
arrest@@ ed without a war@@ rant ?
who from our dram@@ as ?
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " sounded like it 's still going on .
" morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ?
is represent@@ ative kim there ?
yes , but i don 't think he 'll be released easily .
seems like there was an order from the hig@@ her@@ up@@ s .
someone must be behind all this .
okay ...
thanks .
she 'd said she 'd rev@@ ise it ... how dare she make a fool of me ?
!
hy@@ ung we 're here .
oh , why are you here ?
why ?
do you have to ask ? so , let me get this straight , both of you have issues with the kissing scene in episode 7 ?
that 's right .
-@@ that 's right .
but both of you knew that there will be some romance later in the story . although they realize that they love each other more than any@@ body , they have to be enem@@ ies , so this is a pi@@ vo@@ tal turning point for these two charac@@ ters .
that 's what makes it all the more trag@@ ic .
a kiss doesn 't make it more trag@@ ic , though , to leave it as trag@@ ic , they should just stare at each other .
which we can pull off well enough with our acting skil@@ ls .
exactly !
at any rate , change it like that .
without the kiss .
after revis@@ ing the previ@@ ous draft because it was considered too bl@@ and , i can 't do that .
who said that ?
i mean , who said that it 's bl@@ and ? well , i 'm not saying that i revis@@ ed it because of one person 's opinion , but i also thought it was bl@@ and after all , so i ended up revis@@ ing it . also , if , by any chance , this is because you don 't get along with each other , i 'll be seriously disap@@ pointed .
un@@ ni , do we not get a long ? [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
i wouldn 't say we don 't . [ still uses honor@@ ific@@ s ]
what does the director say ?
no matter what the director says , i can 't do it .
no , i won 't .
don 't change your word later .
we have to be persist@@ ent to the end .
just make sure that you don 't change your words .
don 't worry .
i also have no desire to kiss you .
well then , that 's good . if i could avoid kissing that fire@@ fox ,
i 'd glad@@ ly sw@@ im in the ocean again ! if i have to kiss that mor@@ on , i 'd rather have my character shot dead so i can quit the drama .
so , hy@@ ung , do you think writ@@ er lee will rev@@ ise it ?
after all , you did end up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean .
jesus christ !
no way !
mor@@ on
yes ? i 'd like to share from my experience of ending up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean , if we really want to avoid the kiss scene , we have to present an appropri@@ ate alternative .
alternative ?
for ex@@ ample , we could make the revision our@@ selves and give it to her .
that 's not a bad idea .
this one , this one , this one , this one ! take out " he kisses her , " and change it to " woo@@ jin gaz@@ es at her . "
well , that does@@ nt work with the flow of the movement from the earlier scene .
you also have to take out the " he grab@@ s her hand and stop@@ s her from leaving . "
then , how is he going to gaze at her ?
just blan@@ k@@ ly ?
can 't you pull it off with your acting skil@@ ls ?
well , i have to see you to try acting .
then , why don 't we each fix our own parts .
okay , fine . i got it . i 'm hanging up .
good .
that idiot .
dar@@ n , that vi@@ xen .
man , if she 's going to do it anyway , why doesn 't she fix mine , too ...
jesus christ .
oh , writ@@ er lee .
your revision of the kiss scene is great !
but , represent@@ ative kim isn 't here ?
no . he left in the morning .
what is it ?
nothing , just wondering why i couldn 't reach him .
let 's not waste any more time here .
no matter what , you 'll end up in prison .
just f@@ ess up everything so that your sent@@ ence can get reduc@@ ed at least , mr. stif@@ f-@@ neck !
man , what is he doing with his phone turned off all day ?
yes , director , this is writ@@ er lee .
could i see you for a moment ?
" no matter what the director says , i can 't do it ? "
" no , i won 't ? "
no , that 's not it , director . that 's ...
i didn 't know you were such a s@@ nit@@ ch , writ@@ er lee .
excuse me ?
a s@@ nit@@ ch ? director ... in the end , what you 're saying is that you absolutely can 't do the kiss scene .
that 's correct . i 'm really sorry , but i just can 't do it , director .
yes , me too . fine , if you have to have things your way , then i 'll do things my way , too .
you know about my past , right ?
if i say i quit , i do quit !
and once i get started on something , there 's no stopping me . the past five years , i was dro@@ wning in wine , ru@@ in@@ ing my life , then turned around to work really hard on a drama .
once i drink this , i have no idea what might become of me .
what are you going to do ?
can you do it or not ?
the taste of wine is drag@@ ging me back to alco@@ hol@@ ism .
director !
director !
i 'll do it .
and you , min ah ? i 'll do it , but , i can 't drink any alcohol , director .
then go and have a good night 's sleep .
tomorrow we have a full sched@@ ule ahead !
i understand .
i 'm leaving .
ah , really how can you keep drinking ?
you have a drink too .
re@@ fresh@@ ing cas@@ sia se@@ ed tea is good for your health .
what ?
cas@@ sia se@@ ed tea ?
oh !
this really isn 't alcohol .
ah , you really shocked me !
this is what it means to be " se@@ as@@ oned . "
it 's good ! someone was so confid@@ ent about not changing his mind , but i shouldn 't have trust@@ ed someone 's words .
then what about you ?
who suggested it first ?
you 'd better brush your teeth proper@@ ly ( before film@@ ing the kiss scene ) .
four times per day !
you 'd better have your teeth scal@@ ed !
the represent@@ ative hasn 't come back yet ? yes , his cell phone is still turned off , so i was worried and waiting for him , but now i 'm about to go home .
he has never been like this before .
represent@@ ative ?
ah , yes ...
who ?
i 'm sorry but there is no one named kim bong dal in this company .
yes .
i 'm sorry , but i guess you dial@@ ed the wrong number .
hold on , pd jo@@ o .
hold on , please .
hello .
hello , this is from cham@@ som@@ ang sanat@@ orium .
sanat@@ orium ?
yes .
is there anyone named kim bong dal ?
ah , if you tell me what you called for , i will leave the message for him .
i called because mr. kim bong dal 's mother is in crit@@ ical condition now .
mo ... his mother ?
yes . please tell him he must come now .
well , wait a moment , where is your sanat@@ orium ?
okay .
what is the reason you came to visit me ?
regar@@ ding the pro@@ secu@@ tor 's investig@@ ation about represent@@ ative kim , which is cur@@ r@@ ently happening , please halt it right away .
i didn 't know that you cher@@ ished anthony that much , director nam .
no !
stop trying to sab@@ ot@@ age the production of " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " please !
how dare you order me to stop ...
father !
it has already been for 20 years that you didn 't acknow@@ ledge me as your father , shut@@ ting me off .
but now , are you taking sides with that bastard who back@@ stab@@ bed your father ?
i got it .
then , not as your son , but as director of s@@ bc drama department , please let me re@@ phrase it . your con@@ temp@@ tible action , mr@@ .@@ cha@@ ir@@ man , then can you stop doing this ? anthony , that bastard has also lived in the way which you are con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous of , so he 's just pur@@ ged of that sin .
that 's all .
pur@@ ged of the sin ?
then , do you think you 're not guilty ?
what ?
please stop .
okay ?
and also ... as you said , i 've been shut@@ ting you off for last 20 years . but if you still have thoughts of me as your son , and if you don 't want to lose your one and only son forever , please stop , i beg you .
yes .
huh ?
!
i understand .
let 's do that .
you ... you 're really capable , i guess . i don 't know why , but it seems that the high authority has changed his mind .
the charges are dropped , and the case is wrapped up as if nothing happened .
ah , yes , i 'm really sorry to bother you for this .
some@@ time soon , i 'll ar@@ range a meeting .
let 's have dinner together .
ah , yes ... yes , then ...
let me ask you just one thing .
what is the reason you tried to protect that bastard ?
please let me tell you once again .
what i want to protect is only the drama " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong , " which i 'm in charge of as director of drama department . and also , your interrup@@ tion in my drama by using that dirty trick , i hope that never happens again from now on .
fine .
but you should know this one thing at least . that dirty trick you 're talking about , you also had benef@@ its from it .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of fac@@ tion or connec@@ tions ?
what ... what are you talking about ?
that 's right .
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you desp@@ ise so much !
anthony is released ?
what are you saying ?
!
i heard that the case is closed now .
i think that cha@@ ir@@ man ordered to drop the charges .
the cha@@ ir@@ man ?
it 's me , mr. cha@@ ir@@ man .
i don 't know what to say to express my grat@@ itude .
you 'd better thank director nam wo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ong .
how do you think you became director , despite your lack of fac@@ tion or connec@@ tions ?
that position was also given to you by your father 's power , which you desp@@ ise so much !
what br@@ ings you here at this late hour , represent@@ ative kim ?
i came to say thank you . well , i don 't know what you 've heard or where , but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but i just did what i could do for my drama .
but can i ask you how you resol@@ ved it ?
i don 't think i have to tell you about that .
yeah .
yes ?
yes , it 's me .
huh ?
mom ...
mom !
how did this happen ?
this afternoon , her condition sud@@ de@@ ly became crit@@ ical .
but luc@@ kil@@ y , the crit@@ ical moment is gone , and now she 's stable .
so , you don 't need to worry so much .
are you ok ?
i didn 't know your mother was still alive .
why did you say it like that before ?
that she had passed away .
i ... really hated them .
our extreme po@@ ver@@ ty , my father who abandon@@ ed me as soon as i was born , whose face i 've never seen , and even my mother who is blind .
i hated them all and was as@@ ham@@ ed of them .
when i got to the usa , i made a resolution .
that i will forget everything that happened in korea . from now on , i 'm anthony , i don 't know anything about po@@ ver@@ ty , and i grew up in the states , i 'm anthony .
and that 's what i told everybody , too . that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as in@@ herit@@ ance .
that i grew up with a happy chil@@ d@@ hood .
i 'm ... a big co@@ ward .
what 's the next scene ?
kim wo@@ o jin and jin h@@ ye rin 's kissing scene .
is it ?
and the ac@@ tors ?
a kissing scene with that mor@@ on ?
just thinking about it makes me sick !
min ah , just close your eyes and get over with it , please ?
what else can we do at this point ?
hy@@ ung .
do you really have to go that far ?
affa@@ wh@@ as@@ hi@@ dit@@ amel@@ ash@@ time ?
( after what she did to me last time ?
)
af@@ car@@ sha@@ haf@@ tag@@ oth@@ ish@@ far .
( of course i have to go this far . )
af@@ car@@ sh .
( of course . )
if you are ready , you may come out .
from now on , can you play the piano only for me ?
even if i were to betr@@ ay you ?
even if i were to dece@@ ive you ?
could you still play it only for me ?
cut !
ah , min ah , what 's wrong ?
you were doing so well !
go brush your teeth before i throw a fit . [ dropping the honor@@ ific@@ s ]
yes , no@@ ona .
i knew you 'd say that .
" is there anyone that came to your mind first or that you are most grateful for ? "
" of course , it 's my mom . mrs. park k@@ ang ja . "
of course , of course it 's your mom .
who else but your mom ?
by the way , mom ...
what is it ?
there is someone i know ... whose past is so full of pain that he can 't get over it ...
sure , there are people like that .
he wanted to forget about his past so much so that he said his mother had passed away even though she 's alive .
does that make him a bad person ?
of course that makes him a bad person .
then why the he@@ ck would someone not think of him as a bad person ?
well , that means that someone likes that person .
why ?
is this about you ?
no !
it 's for my drama .
so cold . aun@@ ty , i 've come for some gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els !
oh !
welcome !
and that 's what i told other people , too .
that my parents passed away leaving me a fortune as in@@ herit@@ ance . that i grew up with a happy chil@@ d@@ hood .
i 'm ... a big co@@ ward ...
what are you thinking about ?
i couldn 't reach you at all all day yesterday .
did something happen ?
nothing really .
you did that back then , too .
five years ago , when you broke up with me and left .
like yesterday , i couldn 't reach you at all all of a sudden . after trans@@ forming the ro@@ o@@ kie act@@ ress sung min ah into the god@@ dess of melo@@ dram@@ as , you deser@@ ted me , leaving as if you were running away .
i 've told you already .
i 've er@@ ased all my memories of you .
don 't lie .
though you may not have had started out that way , towards the end , you ended up loving me .
yes , i admit that i did like you .
then , why did you leave ?
you 're an act@@ ress who should be loved by everybody . if that 's the only reason , don 't leave me ever again .

like people who were w@@ ishing that i wouldn 't get out .
don 't tell me ... you weren 't crying , right ?
what crying ?
all the smoke is blo@@ wing in my direction , it 's killing my eyes .
represent@@ ative , are you okay ?
i 'm okay .

how is his blood pressure ?
180 .
how much ?
97 .
move him to inten@@ sive care !
yes .
where is the hospital ?
i have to go there as well .
the director said the ac@@ tors and staff shouldn 't come .
and just stand by near here .
he will contact us .
what are you thinking about ?
the extra who died on my set on that day , 5 years ago ...
that day comes up again and again in my memory .
5 years earlier .
what do we do ?

bring my son back to life !
i 'm telling you to bring him back !

you ... come back again .
hey , i just sub@@ mit@@ ted my re@@ sign@@ ation .
what are you talking about ?
the president hasn 't appro@@ ved it yet .
you know what kind of a person deput@@ y director kim is .
as soon as you you sub@@ mit@@ ted your re@@ sign@@ ation , he 's already so busy to put his people in the important positions .
do you think that 's all ? all the dram@@ as with great qu@@ ality , which you gave the time slo@@ ts , they are all cancel@@ led now .
wo@@ on h@@ ye@@ ong , i 'm beg@@ ging you . to drama department , please come back .
let 's drink .
what are you thinking so hard about ?
no , it 's nothing .
by the way ...
why did you really run in ?
you were the kind of person who worked on the princip@@ le of certain@@ ty based on numbers .
i 'm just curious if you had such confidence when you ran into the fire .
seriously , why did you run in ?
someone pushed me from behind .
honestly , i don 't know either .
why i did that in that moment .
i want to know .
the more i know you , the better i want to get to know you .
i am brad pit@@ t .
oh , bit na it 'll be hard to see you today . i 'll see you tomorrow , huh ?
that person who got hurt is fine now .
you have to throw a party for him too ?
even so a person i work with came back from the dead .
what am i supposed to do .
so ... now you 're saying that aj@@ us@@ shi is more important than i am ?
that 's not what i 'm saying .
you 're saying you can 't come because some nobody extra got hurt .
what ?
some nobody extra ?
what ?
am i wrong ?
how can you say something like that ?
so ru@@ de@@ ly ?
what ?
op@@ pa , are you ... mad at me right now ?
be honest , right now you 're drinking and playing with that bitch sung min ah .
what@@ -
fine !
i 'm playing with sung min ah .
i want to play with sung min ah . all night long !
op@@ pa !
do you like that bitch ?
yes i love sung min ah , i love her very much , i love her so very much !
i love you so much sung min ah !
hanging up !
have you gone crazy ?
don 't take this wrong .
i might look crazy now , but ...
don 't come any closer !
that 's not it@@ -
i said don 't come any closer !
no , i mean ...
you !
i 'm warning you .
find someone within your league .
- good morning !
- have you slept well ?
represent@@ ative isn 't here ?
ah , he had to go to seoul .
ah ... riding on that food truck ?
yes .
i wonder if he 's doing ok with the trip .
oh , you 're here .
yes .
writ@@ er lee , let 's go together in my car .
yes .
it 's rain@@ ing all of a sudden .
this is the first time i 've rid@@ den in a car with a writ@@ er like this .
yes .
ah , you said before , that you and represent@@ ative kim are like an angel and a demon .
ah , before ...
what happened so that he 's called as a demon@@ -@@ like bad produc@@ er ?
i 'm just curious if he was different ( to you ) from represent@@ ative kim whom i know .
frank@@ ly speaking , i like represent@@ ative kim .
no , i mean , two of us used to love each other , so we 're trying to work it out from now on .
i 'm hoping you , writ@@ er lee , can help our relationship .
you can tell re@@ presen@@ ative kim is a really great guy as soon as you see him .
all of you , aren 't you embarrassed to bring me this rat@@ ing chart ?
cp choi of the daily drama .
yes , deput@@ y director .
why do you think your rat@@ ing is bad ?
why is such bad rat@@ ings happening ?
and , " children of paradise , " make it end within this month . it 's qu@@ ality is good and the reaction from vie@@ wers is getting better .
it 's qu@@ ality is good and the reaction from vie@@ wers is getting better .
qu@@ ality , potential ... do you think such things will bring more adver@@ tis@@ ement ?
until when will you wait for the bit@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ bit increas@@ ing rat@@ ing ?
the next drama after " children of paradise ... "
where is cp oh ?
oh , cp oh !
don 't make some tri@@ vial one , but something sens@@ ational , something stun@@ ning ! yes .
listen carefully !
i care about only rat@@ ing .
rat@@ ing , rat@@ ing , rat@@ ing !
do proper@@ ly , please !
shall we buy a dog , too ?
no way . i really hate dogs .
- why not ?
we love dogs a lot .
- then , who will take care of it ?
you must be coming back from gro@@ cer@@ y shopping .
you should say hello . hello !
hello !
oh this kid .
you look a lot like your dad , huh ?
but , who are you ah@@ jus@@ si ?
ah , someone dad works with .
go in , first .
let 's go home .
goodbye .
i 'm sure you 've heard the news , and i have nothing to say to you .
please , just leave .
were you somebody who feels so little respon@@ sibil@@ ity ?
what is your reason ? you tried hard to change all sh@@ ady dirty tr@@ icks by even ris@@ king your director position , but now , what on earth is the reason you stepped down from that position ? well , i 'm sorry for not taking respon@@ sibil@@ ity for " morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " until the end , but i can 't tell you why .
please leave . until i hear that reason , i can 't leave . the director position i got was given not by my compet@@ ence , but by that sh@@ ady trick which i desp@@ ised so much , and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ? and i found that out later .
well , is that good enough to be a reason ?
what do you mean ?
nam go@@ ok h@@ ye@@ on , cha@@ ir@@ man of empire group .
i got the position because of my father 's power .
maybe , that 's why i hated you more , represent@@ ative kim .
to me , you seemed worse than my father .
i wanted to den@@ y such father , so i have lived , thinking i don 't have a father .
i wanted to hide it until the end if i could .
well , then that 's enough for the reason , isn 't it ?
no .
if that is why ( you re@@ signed ) , it can 't be a reason to me even more .
i also had a family whom i wanted to den@@ y once .
but even so , i didn 't run away from the path i had to go .
you once told me that people like me should dis@@ appear from this field .
but in the end , i 'm still here , but you 're leaving .
before you leave , just keep this in your mind .
then , at the end , there will be only dirty people left with sh@@ ady tr@@ icks .
now hy@@ un min , pass the th@@ ug@@ s sent by choi , look towards min ah .
hy@@ un min 's face is full of surprise !
that 's right , that 's right !
good ! still in shock , hy@@ un min 's line !
hy@@ un min , what about your line ?
i 'm done with you !
have your way with the shooting sno@@ g@@ ging your o@@ h-@@ so-@@ bel@@ o@@ ved sung min ah !
huh ?
um , isn 't she ... yo@@ on bit na of the idol group angels ? yo@@ on bit na of the idol group angels ?
( mor@@ on )
let 's take a break for 5 minutes .
yes .
- g@@ wang so@@ o . - yes , hy@@ ung .
why didn 't you block her ? even if i had blo@@ cked her , you 'd still have gotten sl@@ apped .
so un@@ lucky !
to be honest , i like represent@@ ative kim .
to be more specif@@ ic , we used to be in love with each other .
and now , we 're trying to get back together .
i 'm hoping that you , writ@@ er lee , could help us with that .
once you get to know him , represent@@ ative kim is quite a catch .
yes ?
where are you ?
why ?
what do you mean " why " ?
did you forget ?
what ?
what do you mean " what " ?
you said you were going to re-@@ sign your contr@@ act .
that 's why you 're calling right now ?
is there anything to talk about besides that ?
looks l@@ ire you 're at your studio , so i 'll head that way .
no , don 't come .
what ?
i said don 't come , since i 'm going out now .
where are you going ?
do i have to report that to you too ?
mom !
you 're here !
he 's been waiting !
why are you so late ?
i heard that you 're going to sign a contr@@ act for 100 episodes .
he 's also prom@@ ising a lot of money !
well , i 'll leave you two to talk .
i 'll run some er@@ rand@@ s next door .
how did you know to come here ?
besides the writ@@ er 's room , do you have anywhere else to go but here ?
okay , let 's make this contr@@ act , writ@@ er lee .
i 'll do it later .
what ?
did that ss@@ d production company or whatever contact you again ?
par@@ don ?
how much ?
how much did they offer you ?
do you think i 'm doing this because of money ?
then what is it ?
don 't forget how much i had to suff@@ er in that bitter cold because of you .
no ... i - i need to read and review the contr@@ act , don 't i ?
what now ?
you can 't take your word back , alright ?
alright , i got it !
lee go e@@ un .
yes ?
don 't let me wait too long . hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , hy@@ ung , wake up .
wake up !
what is it ?
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other ]
g@@ wang so@@ o , how did this happen ?
i guess one of the staff members who were there at the set that day must have in@@ formed the repor@@ ters .
what day ?
the day when you got sl@@ apped by miss yo@@ on bit na .
i 'm done with you now !
have it your way with the shooting sno@@ g@@ ging that o@@ h-@@ so-@@ bel@@ o@@ ved sung min ah !
oh my mother , father ... un@@ ni , does this even make sense ?
min ah , you should calm down first . calm down , calm down .
i think k@@ ang hy@@ un min released these articles on purpose .
he did it because i wasn 't accep@@ ting his heart .
would he go that far ?
of course !
a mor@@ on like him would easily do this !
un@@ ni , you have no idea how much he is into me right now .
really ?
that bad ?
what the he@@ ck is represent@@ ative oh doing , letting these kind of re@@ ports get publ@@ ished ?
i know , right ?
really !
represent@@ ative , miss sung min ah is in a scand@@ al in the re@@ ports !
what ?
with whom ?
well , it 's ...
is it anthony ?
what the he@@ ck is this ? what the he@@ ck is this ?
the report on miss sung min ah 's scand@@ al .
what the he@@ ck ?
since when did they get so close ?
no wonder ...
i knew it the moment yo@@ on bit na of angels sl@@ apped him .
what ?
sl@@ apped him ?
what happened ?
come on , sp@@ ill it !
we have no time to lose ! well , you should take a look at this .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah are actually in love with each other according to a mik staff ]
represent@@ ative , were you aware of it , too ?
what would you like to have ?
hot jama@@ ic@@ an blue with extra shot .
es@@ pres@@ so .
okay .
what the he@@ ck are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
i know very well that you released those re@@ ports !
what !
?
take those re@@ ports off while i 'm still being civil .
have you lost your mind ?
( in@@ formal@@ ly )
what ! ?
what did you say just now ?
( in@@ formal@@ ly )
you ?
yes , you !
listen carefully . i don 't know exactly how much you like me but i don 't have the s@@ ligh@@ test interest in you so direct your interest el@@ se@@ where and get rid of the articles instantly .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah , you both look so great together .
i wish you to continue loving each other in a bas@@ hing manner , fighting .
why are you sitting here ?
oh my jesus .. oh my jesus ..
have you read that scand@@ al news about k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah ?
that 's very good .
par@@ don ?
people will now watch the drama with more interest@@ s .
it will help the rat@@ ing , don 't you think so ?
" children of paradise , " i think i told you to end it earlier than its original plan . well , that 's ...
in case of " children of paradise , " both the production company and its ac@@ tors are so determined to work for it until the end .
more@@ over , if it ends earlier , the next drama 's first air@@ date should be moved up , but its production company is compl@@ aining a lot because they 're not ready yet .
production company , production company , production company !
what can you do if you keep kissing the as@@ ses of production compan@@ ies !
?
we , who are on top of the heads of such mere production compan@@ ies , are the " a " ! " a " ! if we 're the " a , " then we should show what " a " is supposed to be !
yes , that 's right . sched@@ ul@@ ing the dram@@ as is the own right of us , the broadcasting station , but at the same time , it 's the promise with vie@@ wers .
should we change that preci@@ ous promise with vie@@ wers just because the rat@@ ing is bad , or because its commercial value is bad or not , as if we turn our palm over ? well , as far as i know , you sub@@ mit@@ ted your re@@ sign@@ ation and left our company , so do you think you have the right to come here ?
yes , i just met president .
as of 5 pm , today , i 'm appro@@ ved to come back as director of drama department .
deput@@ y director .
thank you for your work . first , for leaving my position because of my personal reason ,
i 'm sin@@ cer@@ ely sorry .
then , before starting the meeting , let me tell you one thing . that 's right , as our deput@@ y director kim said , we 're the " a. "
but i would appreciate if you remember this point as well .
justice without power is really hel@@ pl@@ ess and vain .
but power without justice is just violence .
now , the era of violence must be ended .
the era of violence must not be repeated .
well , then shall we begin the meeting ?
yes , speaking .
oh , represent@@ ative kim .
i heard there was some hic@@ cup on the shooting sched@@ ule because of the fire accident . i heard there was some hic@@ cup on the shooting sched@@ ule because of the fire accident .
wouldn 't there be any problem for our air sched@@ ule ?
i don 't think it 's something a jo@@ bl@@ ess person has to concern . listen well ,
i 'm talking to you now as director of drama department .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand , director . everything will go well without any issue .
okay , i will rely on you , represent@@ ative kim .
i heard you 're rein@@ stat@@ ed .
yes .
as you see .
what is the reason you changed your mind ?
well , if you hear that , you will be disap@@ pointed .
well , there is nothing more to be disap@@ pointed about .
yes . this position , that 's right , not by my compet@@ ence but by your power , father , by un@@ just meth@@ od , it 's given to me .
even if i didn 't know that , it 's also my fault .
but , just quit@@ ting isn 't sol@@ ving everything , and i should do my best in this very position to not let this drama field rot , to not let this drama go back to the past dirty way .
i thought that is very important .
well , times have changed , i guess .
i will keep watching whether you would change or the world would change .
represent@@ ative ...
what ?
let 's think about warm things .
for me , it 's bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
the first thing coming in your mind is that che@@ ap bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o ?
what 's wrong with bak@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
if you 're not careful enough , your mouth will get bur@@ nt .
you have to blow on them as you eat since they are so hot .
miss , would you like a sweet po@@ tat@@ o ?
no thank you , i 'm fine .
please keep s@@ elling many .
no . no , lee go e@@ un .
don 't think us@@ eless thoughts .
concentr@@ ate on the script .
concentr@@ ate for the waiting vie@@ wers of your drama .
okay , you can do it ! aja aja ! lee go e@@ un , fighting !
who is it ?
it 's me .
what are you doing , not opening the door ?
what 's the matter ?
have you made a decision ?
what decision ?
ren@@ e@@ wing the contr@@ act .
is that why you came ?
no .
because of this . no . because of this .
you said you wanted to eat ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shi@@ vering that you wanted to eat sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
i remember .
don 't mis@@ understand .
i didn 't do this because of the contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al and i didn 't do it for some other ul@@ ter@@ ior motive either .
honestly , i just bought them when i saw the street ven@@ dor s@@ elling them nearby , so just enjoy .
eat it before it gets cold . i 'm leaving .
i don 't even believe in myself sometimes but i believe in you .
you 're not ... crying , right ?
no , the two of us , we used to love each other , and now , we 're thinking of working it out .
because of this .
you don 't remember that night ?
you said while shi@@ vering that you wanted to eat sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
what ?
do they taste bad ?
why do you conf@@ use people ?
what ?
you 're dating sung min ah , why are you being like this to me ?
dating sung min ah ?
who ?
what do you mean , " who " ?
you are .
why would that person give me sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
who said i was dating sung min ah ?
eh ?
i don 't know where you heard that strange ru@@ mor no , i guess you 're saying that because you saw me with sung min ah here before .
i don 't have such feelings for wh@@ om@@ ever , so you don 't have to be concerned .
well , it 's not that i 'm concern about that but ...
that is ... and , if somebody bu@@ ys you sweet po@@ tat@@ o , are you always confused ?
what are you confused about ?
no ...
well , this ... if this is from china or from domest@@ ic ... i was confused ...
that is ... do you by chance like me ?
then again , that would never happen .
represent@@ ative .
what ?
episode 15 we have crossed the r@@ ubic@@ on do you like me by any chance ? but then , there is no way you would .
represent@@ ative . what ? n-@@ -@@ no , it 's nothing .
so silly . right ! i like you !
i said i like you .
i must be crazy , i 'm crazy .
i 'm not in my right mind .
i like you !
i said i like you .
hy@@ ung , what are you waiting for ?
just tell her like a man !
easier said than done .
i just can 't work up the courage .
that 's why you need to get brave .
just make up your mind and walk up to her ...
walk up to what ?
you have arrived .
pd jo@@ o , what is it ?
something wrong ?
no , nothing .
actually , jo@@ o pd ...
sp@@ ill it , go@@ o he@@ e j@@ ae .
what is it ? pd jo@@ o fell in love .
what ?
love ?
yes . the moment he saw the young@@ est f@@ d of the direc@@ ting team , he fell for her .
jo@@ o pd .
yes .
are you in your right mind ?
eh ?
do you think i pay you just so you could chase ch@@ icks at the film@@ ing site ?
what kind of a production pd doesn 't separ@@ ate his private life from his work ?
tell me .
are you really dating k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
i don 't know about it .
if you really want to know , you could go ask that mor@@ on yourself .
i need to go for more shooting . min ah , either anthony or k@@ ang hy@@ un min , the way i see it , your taste in men is really low .
what ?
you know it . our hy@@ un min is so gentle and consider@@ ate , which could cause such rum@@ ors with miss sung min ah , but ... hy@@ ung , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
represent@@ ative choi ! red long john@@ s , red pants !
what '@@ cha do@@ in ' ?
- just shut up already !
ah , at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
yes , then , i 'm hanging up .
i was just expl@@ aining to the reporter about your ru@@ mor !
ah , you were being inter@@ vie@@ wed ?
yes . you should have said so then .
hy@@ ung !
how can you hang up so ru@@ de@@ ly when it was such an important call ?
they 're only going to get more susp@@ icious !
what exactly do you do for me as my represent@@ ative ?
do you even know that my kore@@ an be@@ ef en@@ dor@@ sement contr@@ act is about to exp@@ ire ?
don 't worry , they 're coming this afternoon .
really ?
i 'm warning you .
stop staring at me .
i 'm out of your league , so give up and just concentr@@ ate on your drama .
ah well , with your un@@ requ@@ ited love and en@@ dor@@ sements ... you 're bus@@ ider than a bee , no wonder you 'd forget about the drama .
what ?
un@@ requ@@ ited love ?
bus@@ ier than a bee ?
hy@@ ung !
is there a bee farm around here ?
why did it fa@@ il ?
hey ! isn 't " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " a total hit ?
i know !
hy@@ un min op@@ pa is so amazing in that one !
but , i 'm not sure about the recent episodes .
why ?
think about it . jin h@@ ye rin told kim wo@@ o jin that she loves him and whatever .
they even kissed !
and now she 's going to betr@@ ay him ?
what 's up with that ?
that 's true .
that doesn 't make sense .
ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es , chip@@ s , ram@@ y@@ un ...
such a chil@@ dish ap@@ petite you have .
don 't you care about staying in shape ?
are you listening to me ?
yes .
your mother is at your studio , so get going .
mom ?
it 's del@@ icious .
aig@@ oo , it already started !
you 're watching it again ?
of course ! i 'm watching all the r@@ er@@ uns , too .
is it that fun ?
of course .
whose daughter wrote it , after all ?
gos@@ h , why is he like that again ?
go e@@ un ... that jin h@@ ye rin , is she betr@@ aying kim wo@@ o jin after all ?
no .
actually , this will be reve@@ aled much later , but she 's not really betr@@ aying him .
she 's preten@@ ding to betr@@ ay him because there 's no other way , but she 's really helping kim wo@@ o jin .
oh , it was like that ?
had i known that , i wouldn 't have been cur@@ sing her .
my daughter is amazing !
you are a gen@@ ius , gen@@ ius !
it 's starting .
now , let 's hear from mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's management staff . as you know , our hy@@ un min is so gentle and consider@@ ate , that it causes such mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings ... but at any rate , they 're not in a relationship at all .
why , what are you doing ?
represent@@ ative choi ! - just shut up already !
your voice came out also .
how embarras@@ sing ...
like this , the management is den@@ ying the ru@@ mor , but re@@ ports of wit@@ nes@@ ses who saw the two ac@@ tors dating at a cafe or at the film@@ ing studio keep sur@@ facing , prom@@ p@@ ting the possibil@@ ity of another celebr@@ ity couple being in the making , which is a hot po@@ tat@@ o in the world of entertainment gos@@ sip cur@@ r@@ ently .
ah , seriously !
celebr@@ ity couple in the making ?
i told them no ! why don 't they believe me ?
! that 's why you should have been more firm !
my cf , my money is here !
i 've been really enjoying " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " lat@@ ely . ah , speaking of which ,
how about doing it with miss sung min ah this time as a couple ?
jud@@ ging from the drama , the two of you really look great and work well together .
i 've been doing this by myself for 3 years , why would i do it with sung min ah now ?
well , it is the wish of the spon@@ sor .
send the spon@@ sor my message clearly : either i , k@@ ang hy@@ un min , do it by myself ,
he will never be able to do it with someone else .
i won 't do it !
oh , you know , right ?
that scand@@ al ... is total non@@ sense .
of course , i know it better than any@@ body .
did you want to see me to talk about that ?
no . there is someone i 'd like you to meet .
ah , there he comes .
say hello to the chief director of ta@@ es@@ an group , kim sang j@@ ik .
i 'm anthony kim .
nice to meet you .
a production company ?
yes .
our company is going to cre@@ ate the larg@@ est production company in asia .
we would like you to be the ceo of that company .
we 'll offer you the high@@ est sal@@ ary in the industry as well as 10 % of the shar@@ es .
what do you think ? although , right now , you are the represent@@ ative of a small production company , for someone who had once created the legend of empire , this is a mat@@ ching offer , i think .
i 'm sorry , but i will dec@@ line .
why ?
are you passing up this excep@@ tional offer ? of course , it is an attr@@ active offer , but however , i don 't want to work under other people any more .
in thinking about our entertainment group , it 's not only into drama but inclu@@ des management .
this first management contr@@ act will be with sung min ah .
if you confir@@ m , then we will move immediately .
it 's here .
you said that you wanted to make the world 's best production , right ?
why don 't you make it , starting from here ?
every year , i will inv@@ est $ 40 million into world production .
of course , the ow@@ ner will be anthony kim .
as long as we get 49 % of the shar@@ es .
what do you think ? this offer ?
exactly what is the reason you are off@@ ering me this deal ? it 's because cre@@ ating a company which ex@@ ce@@ eds empire is our go@@ al . also , the person who created the empire 's my@@ th is you , anthony , is it not ?
i will accept . you have made the right decision !
we will complete the oper@@ ating details and
i will take it as a confir@@ med contr@@ act .
then ...
you are finally able to ach@@ ie@@ ve your dream . watching you succe@@ ed , while watching you , is also the dream that i hoped for .
♫ because your two eyes are far away , i only see you .
♫ because my heart is frozen , i 'm hug@@ ging you . ♫ when your trembling lips touch my ears , ♫ while i dre@@ amed only of you to say the words i love you .
the person who created empire 's my@@ th is exactly you , anthony , is it not ?
you said that you wanted to make asia 's best production did you not ?
why don 't you go ahead and try making it ?
of course , the ow@@ ner is you , anthony kim .
that 's right .
the time has come .
bong dal represent@@ ative , it 's me .
i 'm in the middle of a meeting . i 'm busy , so hang up .
from this moment on , i will start my own drama again .
i think i said that i was in the middle of a meeting .
i 'm busy , so hang up .
if you hang up this time , i 'm not going to leave you be .
what are taking my word for ?
i 'm busy right now but because of you ....
you said you were a busy person .
you said you were in the middle of a meeting .
exactly what kind of person has a meeting by himself on his deck ?
until a few moments ago , i was busy with the meeting .
but what are you trying to say ?
by tomorrow morning , please ga@@ ther the " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong 's " crew .
ga@@ ther ?
it 's something more important than anything .
understand ?
so , you 're going to fix the up@@ lo@@ aded episodes 11 and 12 ?
yes , i wanted to show more of the love between the two charac@@ ters .
up to now , only in episode 13 , it is realized that h@@ ye rin came to help wo@@ o jin .
and then , it was my idea that h@@ ye rin 's character would be seen as nearly sin@@ ister .
because trying to make it too much a film noir was the wrong choice .
so you will modi@@ fy episode 11 by acceler@@ ating the content of episode 13 ?
yes . with that change , i think it will be possible to see the audience ro@@ oting for the two charac@@ ters .
but , can you am@@ end the scre@@ en@@ play in less than four days ?
i can do it .
it 's not something to be de@@ alt with by talking . you have a point there to put the story together , but it 's a big risk .
if that is to happen , we will have to be shooting live straight through the week before .
hy@@ un min , what do you think ?
huh ?
do it like that .
she says she can do it , so why don 't we try belie@@ ving writ@@ er lee ?
is it not un@@ imag@@ ine@@ able , too difficult and are there problems every day ?
can you really do the script in four days ?
yes . i can do it .
fine . if writ@@ er lee says she can do it , then i will wait .
then , take care of yourself .
let 's see how well you can do .
bye .
the writ@@ er says she can do it , so why don 't we trust her once ?
i mean , that 's living .
that fox !
we 're in a state of emergen@@ cy now .
i know . even if you manage to re@@ write the script for 2 episodes , what comes after that is the problem .
for the following episodes , even if there is a problem in the script , we still have to shoot it without changing a thing .
i 'm fully aware of it .
you have to keep this in mind , that the decision you just made , put " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " on a path of no return .
like julius caesar who mar@@ ched toward rome in b.@@ c. 49 , we have crossed the r@@ ubic@@ on river .
let them find out at this point ... and make a powerful ending ...
it 's un@@ locked . since we 're in a state of emergen@@ cy , we have to save the time for sleep as well as food .
natur@@ ally , until you 're done with the revision , you can 't leave the studio .
so , what are all these ? multi@@ vit@@ am@@ ins , red gin@@ sen@@ g extr@@ act , om@@ eg@@ a-@@ 3 for im@@ pro@@ ving circulation , and this is yo@@ gur@@ t , good for const@@ ip@@ ation .
if you 're sitting in one place too long , you get const@@ ip@@ ated .
since your physical health is top prior@@ ity , make sure to take them .
and what is that ? to@@ oth@@ pa@@ ste , sham@@ po@@ o , and lo@@ tion .
also , since i don 't know what you use , i just bought one of each kind .
why , you don 't use the ones with wings ?
i bought them because they cost 1500 won more .
you 're a man , represent@@ ative .
isn 't it weird for a man to buy these for a woman ?
i 'm not a man , but a produc@@ er . you 're not a woman , but a writ@@ er .
i 'll put these away and sit here , so call me if you need anything .
what ?
you 're not leaving ?
why would i leave ?
you 're not writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un .
what , are you sle@@ ep@@ y already ?
no , nothing .
yes , i understand .
then , we will meet next week and discus@@ s .
make an ap@@ pointment with the production company , please .
yes , yes , good work .
by the way , director ...
there 's barely enough time for shooting , how can they rev@@ ise the script now ? how about this , hir@@ ing a more experienced writ@@ er to help writ@@ er lee go e@@ un ...
why don 't we trust writ@@ er lee go e@@ un and wait ? seriously , director , she 's a ro@@ o@@ kie , how can we just trust and wait ?
why , didn 't you call her another writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un ?
well , that ..
after continu@@ ing 10 more years ..
listen , director lee ...
eh ?
just ... just , just ...
uh , director .
director ...
what do we do hy@@ un min ?
why ? what 's the problem ?
i just heard from the kore@@ an be@@ ef commercial .
t@@ the spon@@ sor says , if you don 't do it with sung min ah , he 'd choose another couple .
what ?
!
like who ? i guess they 're trying to contact j@@ ang dong gun and go so young .
j@@ ang dong gun and go so young ?
( a married couple of super@@ stars )
miss sung min ah ...
i think i warned you , not to stare at me .
let 's talk for a moment .
i don 't have anything to talk about with you .
it 's only for a moment .
it 's a very important thing .
so , let me get this straight .
you want us to be in a kore@@ an be@@ ef commercial as a couple ?
i 'm not interested . look for someone else .
don 't take this wrong .
i don 't want to be in a commercial with you , miss sung min ah .
then why are you asking to do it together ?
well , you could call it the respon@@ sibil@@ ity of the leading actor ...
besides , why are you so sel@@ fish , miss sung min ah ?
what ?
when writ@@ er lee is working so hard , are you just going to sit there and do nothing ?
when we do a commercial as a couple , it will also promo@@ te more a@@ waren@@ ess of our drama ... stop that non@@ sense , and tell me the real reason .
ah man , really ...
money .
can 't you just do it this once ?
i 'll do anything you ask .
fine , but i have one condition .
do a tv interview in person , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min , that we 're not in a relationship .
also , release news re@@ ports to clar@@ if@@ y the rum@@ ors .
just make sure to clean up this whole mess about us .
can you promise to do that ?
deal .
then , me too .
deal !
do you think this makes sense ?
why doesn 't it ?
kim wo@@ o jin gives up his li@@ fel@@ ong dream and goes to res@@ cue jin h@@ ye rin ?
what a non@@ sense !
he loves her that much ! of course he 'd rush to save jin h@@ ye rin , leaving everything behind .
what idiot gives up his dream for love ?
how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ? how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ? how can you make kim wo@@ o jin into a fool just to save the character of jin h@@ ye rin ?
if he loves her to death , why wouldn 't he ? in case you haven 't noticed , humans are in@@ nat@@ ely sel@@ fish .
in case you haven 't noticed , humans are in@@ nat@@ ely sel@@ fish .
they cry when they 're hungry , and they smile when they 're full .
have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ? have you ever been in love at all ?
how can you not understand this ?
un@@ like your element@@ ary un@@ requ@@ ited crus@@ hes , i have had lots of experience .
how many ? like what ?
kissing and sleeping together .
you mean , doing those is love ?
what else is there to it ?
uh , so low !
yes , i 'm a thir@@ d-@@ rate low@@ life .
but you don 't even have that experience .
ah , whatever .
i got it . let 's stop this conversation now .
i 'll just write the script . i 'll just write the script .
sure , you write the script .
i 'll make a trip to the office .
you still seem to think that you 're right .
but admit it , you 're wrong .
just go already !
your son looks really amazing .
produc@@ ing a great drama like that .
you must be really proud of him .
he should find a good woman before i pass on .
he 's not married yet ?
i even wonder if he ever liked someone ?
because of the hard@@ ships he had to en@@ dure , he only knows to pretend to be strong .
he doesn 't know how to open up his heart to someone .
i see .
if he had been born to good parents , he could have had a happy life ... what are you doing , not writing the script ?
it 's a movie i must watch for the script .
love letter ?
yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
why would you watch it again then ?
well , to get into the emo@@ tional mood , i have to watch it even for 10@@ 1@@ st time !
it 's all because you 've never been in love that you 're watching something like this .
stop nag@@ ging like that .
i 'm going to watch it anyway .
are you doing well ?
i 'm doing fine !
you 're supposed to make others cry , not cry yourself .
are you doing well ?
( in japan@@ ese ) are you doing well ?
is that sad ?
please stop crying so ugly .
you 're distur@@ bing the person next to you .
it 's sad but really beautiful , right ?
no ?
eh ?
about what ? after a long time has passed , she finally sees the letter the man had left in the book .
even the title of the book is " in search of lost time . "
i read that book so many times even ...
i mean it . you were never in true love , represent@@ ative .
have you ever even shed tears for love ? because my eyes are blin@@ ded , all i can see is you because my heart is frozen , i wrap my arms around you when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , my heart , that had been dre@@ aming of only you ...
because my eyes are blin@@ ded , all i see is you , because my heart is frozen ,
i wrap my arms around you .
when your trembling lips get closer to my ears , anthony , are you crazy ?
this is non@@ sense .
how can that tom@@ boy look so pretty in my eyes ?
are the ter@@ ms of the contr@@ act ok ?
- both k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah agree ... so i don 't think it 'll be a problem .
don 't we need to hear what writ@@ er lee go e@@ un thinks ?
shall we call her ?
well then , represent@@ ative ...
um , represent@@ ative ?
huh ?
oh , what did you say ?
ah , so cold .
it 's too cold !
it wak@@ es me right up !
seriously .
it 's cold !
yes , chief director .
i 'm calling because the cha@@ ir@@ man would like to meet you in person and discus@@ s the contr@@ act .
how about friday evening ?
that 's fine . i 'll see you then .
alright , we 'll decide on the time and place and contact you again .
yes , good bye .
the door is open , what are ... wait , why am i doing this ?
stop this , anthony . i 'm a produc@@ er , and she 's a writ@@ er .
i guess the others haven 't come in yet ?
why ?
here 's the revis@@ ed draft of the script .
what do you think ?
it 's good .
well done .
cut !
ok !
the revis@@ ed draft makes it so much easier to em@@ path@@ ize !
the starting point isn 't too bad . pd jo@@ o , what are you doing ? !
what is the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing for today ?
19.@@ 8 % .
it went up 2.1 % from the day before !
yeah !
ah , good job everyone .
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " so@@ ars even higher as the truth behind jin h@@ ye rin 's betr@@ ay@@ al is reve@@ aled
" morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " lead@@ s the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing for 6 weeks in a row , going over 20 %
as the romance of k@@ ang hy@@ un min and sung min ah dev@@ el@@ op , " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " ke@@ eps its lead .
lat@@ ely , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing has been so@@ aring up impres@@ si@@ vely .
well , i don 't concern myself too much over the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings .
the only thing that i 'm interested in is the love from you .
actually , there is a ru@@ mor that all your attention is focused on a specif@@ ic person , causing the numer@@ ous fans of mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min to watch " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " in je@@ alo@@ us@@ y .
today , we 'd like to hear the truth .
the ru@@ mor with miss sung min ah , is it really just a ru@@ mor ?
today , until you give us an answer about the ru@@ mor , i won 't let you go .
ah , just answer him , you mor@@ on !
miss sung min ah , right .
she 's a great act@@ ress .
she 's a good actor and a good person . i can swear over my family , sad@@ ly , it is only a ru@@ mor .
we 're not dating .
you 're not dating .
however , you may count on the kim wo@@ o jin that is acting with miss sung min ah . the promise made with my pride as an actor at st@@ ake ,
i must keep for sure .
en@@ sure the health of the hub@@ by with kore@@ an be@@ ef ?
new@@ ly@@ wed couple style ?

ah , i see .
did you get a bo@@ to@@ x shot ?
what ?
well , you look some@@ what different .
chu ~ ?
it 's del@@ icious .
take care of your husband 's physical health with kore@@ an be@@ ef .
kore@@ an be@@ ef !
i just vis@@ ited ho@@ eng@@ se@@ ong rec@@ ently .
[ ho@@ eng@@ se@@ ong : famous town for kore@@ an be@@ ef ]
i count on you to promo@@ te more a@@ waren@@ ess about kore@@ an be@@ ef .
what 's with that face ?
you got money and kore@@ an be@@ ef !
isn 't this aw@@ esome ?
ah , what a pa@@ the@@ tic bu@@ m .
pa@@ the@@ tic bu@@ m ?
do you think i 'm just doing this for the money ? even anthony and writ@@ er lee , for the drama , are working on the script together .
then we , also for the drama , could shoot commerci@@ als and promo@@ te our drama !
they 're working on the script together ?
didn 't you know ? all day long , they 're stuck together like this , working on the script , i think .
i told you not to ski@@ p the sup@@ pl@@ ements .
you caught a cold because you 're not physic@@ ally fit .
thirty minutes after a meal .
i 'll make sure to take them this time .
don 't smile .
you grow on me .
my studio isn 't that far .
i can just walk ...
it 's because i 'm cold .
hello ?
it 's me , min ah .
( wait over there for a moment )
yes .
are you busy ?
well , busy as usual .
then , can you get out for a moment ?
i have something to tell you , and i 'm free this evening .
alright .
alright .
i 'll see you then .
we 're going to re@@ loc@@ ate our office .
the office ?
yes , to a much bigger place .
is it something miss sung min ah helped you with ?
she introduc@@ ed me to a company that wants to inv@@ est in our shar@@ es .
yes . once the contr@@ act goes smooth@@ ly tomorrow , i 'll get you a new studio with a better view , so you can prepare for the next project .
with sung min ah as the lead .
with miss sung min ah as the lead act@@ ress ?
that was their condition .
so stop beating around the bush and putting off your contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al , and let 's ren@@ ew your contr@@ act .
yes .
it couldn 't have been easy for a ro@@ o@@ kie writ@@ er to change the course of the stor@@ y@@ line in the middle .
you must have really helped her a lot , represent@@ ative .
of course . she couldn 't have come this far without my help .
speaking of which , i 'd like to let lee go e@@ un write our next project , too .
what do you think ?
well , if the script is good , i have nothing against it .
sure .
ah , you know what 's tomorrow , right ?
the contr@@ act with the cha@@ ir@@ man of ta@@ es@@ an group .
yes , at 6@@ pm in che@@ ong@@ dam@@ dong , i heard .
since you 'll meet him for the first time , it would be good to talk over dinner .
so i asked them to meet there .
you used to like the restaur@@ ants there . also , tomorrow , i 'll also expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me you forgot ?
can you tell me that you don 't have any feelings for me ?
then , stop telling me to forget .
once we start again , there won 't be any reason for us to break up ever again .
min ah , i 'll wait .
also , tomorrow , i 'll expect to hear your answer to my question .
don 't tell me , you forgot .
your vision got blur@@ ry all of a sudden , and you felt diz@@ zy ?
yes .
did you have a lot of stress lat@@ ely , or did you over@@ work yourself ?
what man in korea doesn 't live like that ?
then , are you taking any drug@@ s for long term ?
i 've been taking an anti@@ depres@@ sant for about 3 years now .
three years ... then , have you had these symp@@ tom@@ s before that ? no , it never happened before , only rec@@ ently , about twice .
we 'll know more after you get a thor@@ ough physical ex@@ am and get the resul@@ ts back .
at this point , it seems like a side effect of the anti@@ depres@@ sant .
cut !
okay !
we 'll shoot the next scene after 10 minutes !
g@@ wang so@@ o , phone .
g@@ wang so@@ o ? so , over that pretty faced f@@ d ch@@ ick , the two of you are having a mental race ?
yes . g@@ wang so@@ o , in order to capture the heart of a lady ; first , you have to show her your own sexy smile often .
smile .
smile .
director ? look at sung min ah , she 's so stun@@ ned .
but if i keep sending her the same smile over and over , som@@ ed@@ ay she 'll ask .
ask what ?
why do you smile like that whenever you see me ?
and then ?
then , you need to say an imp@@ act@@ ful , short , and conc@@ ise phrase that will se@@ du@@ ce her .
your eyes make me smile .
ew@@ w , it 's so che@@ es@@ y !
i feel n@@ aus@@ e@@ ous .
did you take your pil@@ ls ?
you 're here ?
i said did you take your medicine ?
yes .
how 's your f@@ ever ?
i think it went down .
stop writing the script for today and rest .
no i 'm fine .
i have to hurry and write and turn in the script for episode 13 , so i can 't rest .
don 't argue and just go to the hospital .
go and get another shot .

i 'm sorry
there was a situation .

what problem is greater than your dream , your future ?
was writ@@ er lee go e@@ un such an important person to you ?
why can 't you answer ?
is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un so important to you ?
that 's right .
lee go e@@ un is an important person to me .
i finally realized it .

[ pre@@ view ] about when kim wo@@ o jin goes to save jin h@@ ye rin ...
i think you 're right .

if you bother writ@@ er lee one more time , i swear to god .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min is all over the place .
i only saw his foot acting .

we have to sign a contr@@ act .
why are we writing a contr@@ act on christmas eve ?
... but why does my vision get clo@@ ud@@ y at times ?
how would getting a check up at the eye hospital sound ?
episode 16 in search of lost time i 'm sorry . something came up .
what came up ? what can possibly be more important than your dream and your future ? is writ@@ er lee go e@@ un that important to you ?
why aren 't you ans@@ wering ? i asked if writ@@ er lee go e@@ un is that important to you . that 's right .
lee go e@@ un is a very important person to me .
i didn 't realize it until just now .
lee go e@@ un .

yes , she is , but how did you ... ?
i heard from miss sung min ah .

this time , it 's for a pain@@ killer .
miss sung min ah is in ag@@ ony because of a bad head@@ ache , and tada ~ i appear to hand you the pil@@ ls .
listen carefully ...
from now on until i die , i won 't ever do another commercial with you , mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min .

what 's up with her ?
does she not like it because it 's pain@@ kil@@ lers ?
i like it .
" mel@@ ta@@ way q ! "
thank you .
thanks to you , the contr@@ act will be fine .
good for you .
also ... your feelings for writ@@ er lee go e@@ un , i understand . working together for some time can bring the two of you closer , and you can grow on each other .
however , even after the drama is over , will your feelings stay the same ?
i won 't be im@@ patient .
when the time comes , i 'll be able to hear the answer .
are you sure you were sick ?
yes . i was really , really sick .
did you see a doctor ?
of course i did !
aig@@ oo , if you were that sick , you should have called me .
how could you go see a doctor by yourself ?
no , i didn 't go alone .
with whom ?
well , with ... a person ?
a person ?
who exactly ?
ah , mom , i 'm eating !
you ... have a man , right ?
no !
lee go e@@ un got a man !
who is it ?
who ?
is it that kim bong dal guy ?
oh , no !
my tum@@ my might get upset !
aren 't you writ@@ er lee 's mother ?
omo , if it isn 't the represent@@ ative !
where are you going ?
i fixed some food for go e@@ un , and now i 'm on my way home .
i 'll give you a ride then .
get in .
no , well , you don 't have to .
the day is too cold for you to walk .
please get in .
have you been doing well lat@@ ely ?
what is there to do well ?
just being busy with my li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood , not even notic@@ ing my own daughter getting sick .
but , by any chance , represent@@ ative , do you know kim bong dal ?
kim bong dal ?
yes .
but why are you curious about that person ? well , it seems like my go e@@ un is interested in him , but she wouldn 't tell me anything .
but , represent@@ ative , is it a person you know ? well , yes , i never got to meet him in person , but i heard that he has a good reputation and his future seems bright .
according to what i 've heard , he even has good looks .
then , take care .
when you 're not too busy , come in for a meal .
yes .
thanks for the ride .
then , you should get back .
no , i 'll see you get in first and then take off .
ah , don 't worry about me and just get back .
then , i 'll see you again later .
aig@@ oo , did he take something wrong ?
where did his mann@@ ers come from ?
that 's so not like him at all !
i think the grand prize for best actor should go to shin ha g@@ yo@@ on . his acting was good , and , more import@@ antly , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings were excellent .
in ter@@ ms of vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings , k@@ ang hy@@ un min is a good conten@@ der , too .
though his acting is nothing out of the ordin@@ ary , but he 's sched@@ ul@@ ed for another s@@ bc drama next year .
the grand prize for best actor should go to a good actor .
yes , i understand both of your positions , but how about j@@ ang jo@@ o sung ?
what , j@@ ang jo@@ o sung ?
yes . yes , well , the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings were low , but just looking at acting alone , he was the best this year .
listen , m broadcasting is giving it to cha se@@ ung won , and k broadcasting is giving it to park shin yang .
yet , we 're going to give it to an ob@@ sc@@ ure , aged actor ?
it 's the grand prize after all , it should go to a star with some clo@@ ut . it 's not an award of appreci@@ ation .
it 's not an award of appreci@@ ation .
yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. j@@ ang to rece@@ ive it ? yes , isn 't that even more reason for mr. j@@ ang to rece@@ ive it ?
it liter@@ ally is the grand prize for best actor .
reg@@ ard@@ less of star@@ ship or vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing , but sol@@ ely looking at the acting performance , right ? well , director , let 's take things with a gr@@ ain of salt .
the a@@ war@@ ding cerem@@ ony for the grand prize is another tv show .
it is another competition for vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings .
besides , we have to discus@@ s this matter with the vari@@ ety department as they 're prepar@@ ing the cerem@@ ony .
so , director nam , you should pay attention to our opin@@ ions , too , this time .
yes , i understand .
then , we shall continue this discus@@ sion in our next meeting .
i 'll come back again .
take care of yourself .
cut !
ok !
now , let 's eat before going to the next scene !
then , we 'll res@@ ume shooting in an hour .
have a good meal !
does a top star have to eat at such an open place ?
there are no good restaur@@ ants around here .
have you watched " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " this week ?
of course .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min was practically flying in his action scenes .
all i could see of k@@ ang hy@@ un min was his suc@@ ky acting .
that 's true .
my eyes are all for min ah no@@ ona .
how could you even notice k@@ ang hy@@ un min ? hey , isn 't that k@@ ang hy@@ un min over there ?
over there .
he is !
he 's good looking .
he does look super@@ b . for real !
don 't miss your classes .
only k@@ ang hy@@ un min . um , hy@@ ung , is sung min ah even pret@@ tier than on screen ?
yes .
mak@@ e-@@ up does wonder@@ s .
what ?
it 's sung min ah .
w@@ hoa !
sung min ah !
hy@@ ung , do it quick , hurry !
sung min ah is leaving !
i 'd like to get an auto@@ graph , too .
ah , yes .
by the way , what is your name , young man ?
brad pit@@ t .
alright , one person at a time .
what is your name ?
- park sung ho@@ on !
g@@ wang so@@ o ?
from now on , we should always eat in front of an all-@@ girls high@@ school .
i was thinking of prepar@@ ing red gin@@ sen@@ g as presents for the broadcasting compan@@ ies for this season .
what ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g my bu@@ m .
that doesn 't suit the scale of the empire .
prepare impor@@ ted wine . top not@@ ch grade .
yes . understood .
what ?
red gin@@ sen@@ g ?
present red gin@@ sen@@ g to the broadcasting compan@@ ies with se@@ as@@ onal gre@@ et@@ ings ?
yes , i think that would be appropri@@ ate .
are you in your right mind ?
we don 't have money for that !
you may leave .
yes . ah , pd jo@@ o ,
yes .
bring me the c@@ vs of the writ@@ ers with whom we have contr@@ acts .
our ... writ@@ ers ?
the only writ@@ er that has a contr@@ act with us is just writ@@ er lee .
yes , bring hers .
why do you want her cv all of a sudden ?
do i have to explain that to you ?
no .
sorry , i was too busy .
i sin@@ cer@@ ely apologi@@ ze .
but i don 't think i can come to the christmas reunion this year , either , because i have to work on my script .
i guess you guys will have fun without me . yes , but instead ,
i 'll treat you gener@@ ously next year after the drama is done .
alright .
see you next year .
yes .
her hob@@ by is to watch movies , speci@@ al@@ ty is ta@@ e ... official 4@@ th de@@ gree black belt in ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do ... favorite food is gr@@ il@@ led mac@@ ker@@ els and ... ro@@ ast@@ ed sweet po@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
favorite movie is love letter . love letter ... yes , i 've watched it about 100 times now .
it 's really sad , but really beautiful at the same time .
don 't you agree ?
are you fine ?
( in japan@@ ese )
i 'm fine .
man , that scared me .
what a shock .
don 't you know how to knock ?
i did knock , but you must not have heard me because your ears were covered .
at any rate , why have you come here ?
to get some prin@@ ter paper .
what were you watching , anyway ?
none of your concern .
ah , i think i know .
you know what ?
well , what men normally watch .
ste@@ amy stuff .
that 's not it .
i know men watch it quite often .
it 's ok .
i said that 's really not it .
oh , that 's love letter !
yes , it 's love letter !
i thought you didn 't like this movie ?
just to review my japan@@ ese .
that 's all .
but your japan@@ ese is excellent . super@@ b .
to learn the dial@@ ect of ko@@ be . their accent .
my eyes were too busy watching min ah no@@ ona .
how could you even notice k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
hy@@ ung ?
when is the s@@ bc drama awards cerem@@ ony ?
the 3@@ 1@@ st . why ?
let 's see ... possible conten@@ ders for the grand prize of best actor are ... me ... me ...
there 's only me !
no way . there 's shin ha g@@ yo@@ on .
ah , that 's right .
ha g@@ yo@@ on hy@@ ung .
ah , the brain ...
shin ha g@@ yo@@ on of the brain is too strong ...
can 't let that happen .
at this point , i need an imp@@ act@@ ful scene that will set this k@@ ang hy@@ un min apart for sure ! hy@@ ung , you just said that the new script is out , right ? hy@@ ung , when jin h@@ ye rin is ba@@ w@@ ling her eyes out at the end here , what if i did that ?
you ?
the vie@@ wers will be totally aw@@ ed !
hy@@ ung , tell g@@ wang so@@ o to get the car ready .
well , g@@ wang so@@ o has been rather busy lat@@ ely .
what ?
busy ?
the personal assistant is bus@@ ier than the actor ?
well , that 's not what i mean ...
let 's just go the two of us today .
i understand .
however , take the w@@ age for today out of g@@ wang so@@ o 's pay@@ ment for the month .
take it out !
the closer you are , the more cle@@ ar@@ cut you have to be with money .
isn 't that right , bum@@ ble@@ bee ?
you 're going to the military service soon ?
yes , i just got my draft notice .
please take good care of our hy@@ un min hy@@ ung . un@@ like what appe@@ ars on tv , there are many surpris@@ ing things about hy@@ ung .
yes , i heard from represent@@ ative choi that he re@@ qui@@ res a lot of extra care .
actually , hy@@ un min hy@@ ung does not like to read the script .
so , when he 's playing vide@@ og@@ ames , you have to read it out loud to him .
also , when hy@@ ung cho@@ oses a drama , he prefer@@ s melo@@ drama .
it 's because melo@@ dram@@ as bring more commer@@ ical en@@ dor@@ sement off@@ ers for the male lead .
that 's what he belie@@ ves .
the more i think about it , the more it doesn 't make sense .
how can a drama not have the aspect of melo@@ drama ?
g@@ wang so@@ o .
when there is an ap@@ pointment , he makes sure to be later than the other actor . his sense of pride is strong , so he thinks that to wait for someone is to lose .
what ?
sung min ah is very pun@@ ctu@@ al with her sched@@ ule ?
i told you to go slow , g@@ wang so@@ o . last@@ ly , he may say pre@@ poster@@ ous things sometimes , but you should just agree with him .
he may not be that bright , but he 's a good hy@@ ung .
ah , hey ...
jin h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin .
i need something that can bring out their emotions to the maximum ...
who is it ?
writ@@ er lee !
writ@@ er lee !
open the door !
open !
mer@@ ry christmas , a present for you .
what is it this time ?
just take it , it 's really just a christmas present , nothing more .
omo ! the size is perfect , and they 're really pretty !
thank you !
now that you received my gift , shall we cut to the chase ?
that 's not possible !
why not ?
this drama is for k@@ ang hy@@ un min , and this k@@ ang hy@@ un min wants to ba@@ wl his eyes out .
kim wo@@ o jin is shot , and jin h@@ ye rin em@@ brac@@ es him and cri@@ es .
yes , but instead of jin h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin can cry !
tears of a man .
how innov@@ ating is that ?
well , i suppose it could be innov@@ ating , but sung min ah is better ...
she is better what ?
ah , well , what i mean is ..
kim wo@@ o jin gets shot in jin h@@ ye rin 's place and is ble@@ eding ...
i don 't know !
i don 't know !
i don 't know about that .
just keep in mind that this is the third time .
third time for me to ask you to change something .
i ended up sw@@ im@@ ming in the ocean and kissing that sung min ah . human@@ ly speaking , if i scrat@@ ch your back , you should scrat@@ ch my back , too . give and take .
i war@@ n you . if you don 't change it this time , i won 't go easy on you .
i sent off the new script to the prin@@ ting office .
i 'll be stopping at writ@@ er lee 's studio to drop something off before going home .
yes , i see .
wait .
yes ?
i 'll just take it to her . i need to talk with her anyway .
you , represent@@ ative ?
what 's with that look on your face ?
why , is it something heavy ?
hy@@ ung .
i heard about everything .
you 're going to serve in the military ?
yes . i got the draft notice un@@ expec@@ tedly .
i 'm sorry .
i 've come to say my last good bye .
stay in good health , hy@@ ung .
g@@ wang so@@ o .
i bought it myself from the gro@@ cer@@ y store .
hy@@ ung ! hy@@ ung , thank you for everything , in 2 years from now , i 'll be back in better shape .
yes , i 'll be waiting .
take care .
g@@ wang so@@ o !
take good care of yourself !
i mean , does that even make sense ?
he wants to do the crying scene of jin h@@ ye rin ?
at any rate , what should i do ?
he won 't get over it easily this time .
who is it ?
it 's me .
why are you here ?
this .
pd jo@@ o told me to bring it to you .
ah . so you came all the way here just to bring this to me ?
well ... thats right ...
is the script going well ?
yes .
ah , what should i do ?
what ?
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min came by earlier , and ...
what did hy@@ un min want ?
but , why are you here , represent@@ ative ?
did you see writ@@ er lee go e@@ un earlier today ?
did writ@@ er lee say that ?
she 's such a s@@ nit@@ ch .
well , about that sob@@ bing scene , don 't you think it would be better if kim wo@@ o jin did the crying ?
h@@ mm ...
kim wo@@ o jin crying ?
you sure are professional , understanding my g@@ ist right away . well , at the awards cerem@@ ony at the end of the year ,
ha g@@ yo@@ on hy@@ ung and i are strong candidat@@ es for the grand prize for best actor .
if i were to show an imp@@ act@@ ful scene at this point , i might be able to sec@@ ure the award !
how 's that ? okay , so you want the script to be revis@@ ed so that you 'd do the crying instead ?
exactly that !
do you think you can do that ?
huh ?
you only got this far by pure dum@@ b luck .
with your pa@@ the@@ tic acting skil@@ ls , do you really think you can do that ?
are you done jo@@ king with me ?
no@@ pe , i 've still got a lot more to say .
do you know yourself ? your script analy@@ sis is em@@ el@@ ent@@ ary level , you don 't even know how poor your acting is , you 're the world 's big@@ gest idiot there ever was ! as such , when the script comes out , don 't even change one thing about it , and just read it proper@@ ly !
got it ? but ... i said , do you understand !
what 's up with him ?
why is he like that to me ?
yes , i just saw hy@@ un min .
you saw him ?
what did he say ?
didn 't he throw a fit ?
no@@ pe .
i talked to him with reason , and he accepted it with no problem .
really ?
yes . he 'll do according to the script .
is that true ?
he even said he 's sorry for bo@@ thering you . is that true ? he even said he 's sorry for bo@@ thering you .
that 's a relief .
i mean , you 're really amazing , represent@@ ative .
you took care of it so easily . i was getting a head@@ ache over it .
who am i ?
who else ?
mr. kim bong dal .
anthony .
thank you .
don 't mention it .
if anything ever troubles you , just let me know any time .
you have come .
shall we ?
the cha@@ ir@@ man expec@@ ts a lot from you , mr. anthony .
the preparation for relo@@ cat@@ ing your office will be finished within this month .
ah , miss sung min ah is already here .
oh , i finally get to see you .
i 'm anthony kim .
aig@@ oo , i 've heard a lot about you .
nice to meet you .
please have a seat .
i think i 'll need to take business les@@ sons from you , mr. anthony .
don 't say something like that even as a joke .
i don 't deserve such pr@@ aise .
dram@@ as are made by people , after all .
and you , mr. anthony , know the importance of people .
which makes me very glad to be working with you . well , then ,
i look forward to the business you 'll lead , mr. anthony .
best w@@ ishes .
i don 't know how to express my grat@@ itude to you .
then , instead of saying it to me , show me .
just like you had made the act@@ ress sung min ah into a top star , make your world production into the best company in the world .
i look forward to it .
a new personal assistant ?
yes , my name is an sung mo . you may have heard from g@@ wang so@@ o already , i totally ab@@ hor po@@ ser@@ s , hypo@@ cr@@ ites , and such .
call me hy@@ ung from now on .
yes . yes , hy@@ ung .
at any rate , how did it go with writ@@ er lee ?
is she going to rev@@ ise the script ?
hy@@ ung , don 't get me started on it .
last night , that bastard anthony came all the way here , and ...
he came here ?
what ?
my script analy@@ sis is element@@ ary level and he called me the worst per@@ forming actor ever !
does that make sense ?
i 'm a bad actor ?
who does he have to thank for leading the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings ?
seriously !
sung mo ?
yes .
what do you think ?
about what ?
what else ?
my acting .
yes , you used to be one of the normal vie@@ wers , so you would be an ac@@ cur@@ ate judge .
tell me .
is the acting performance of this k@@ ang hy@@ un min pa@@ the@@ tic ?
just be honest .
just be honest .
is it really true ?
yes .
what do you mean , yes ?
well , i mean , you have good looks , but but your acting isn 't ... that great .
hey , sung mo , you must be refer@@ ring to hy@@ un min 's debut performance !
uh ... i 've watched them all ... even the most recent ones .
well , you told me to be honest .
g@@ wang so@@ o ...
[ g@@ wang so@@ o ]
uh , hy@@ ung , what i said earlier didn 't upset you , did it ?
why would it upset me ?
who do you think i am ?
sung mo , i 'm not that pet@@ ty . well , that 's a relief . you know ,
i 'm really bad at lying .
i can see that .
just focus on driving . so that we won 't be late .
yes , hy@@ ung .
[ k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's imp@@ act@@ ful performance cros@@ ses the sea with his eyes ]
honestly , k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's acting is over@@ rat@@ ed .
his good looks covers it all . however , those looks are fad@@ ing , too .
i 'm only watching it for sung min ah . when i see kh@@ m , i can 't concentr@@ ate on the show .
he su@@ cks .
hey , what day is better than christmas day to conf@@ ess your fel@@ ings to her ?
you have to make a das@@ h for it !
he 's right .
well , that 's why i bought something for her ,
what ?
what is it ?
let 's see !
show us !
excuse me .
mat@@ ching rings !
am i going too forward with this ?
does the woman express the feelings first ?
it is the man who has to open up first ! hear , hear !
besides , a mat@@ ching set of rings sen@@ ds a direct message of " let 's date . "
it 's stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward !

well , maybe ... about this ? ah , i guess his size is the same as the uncle ?
we 're family , after all .
ah .
then , what about the size of the girl your neph@@ ew likes ?
well ,
i think about this big .

un@@ ni , can you get me an ice pack ?
yes .
do you have some time ?
i have something to say .
start talking . what is it ?
you 're not hung up about the commercial ...
is my acting really that bad ?
from your perspec@@ tive , is my acting really poor ? from your perspec@@ tive , is my acting really poor ?
what do you want me to say ?
please tell me honestly . as an act@@ ress . for you to ask me in person , doesn 't that mean you already think so ?
then , let me ask you one thing .
have you ever put any effort into acting ?
or do you know about your weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
then , what about you ?
do you have a weak@@ ness you know about ?
who doesn 't have weak@@ nes@@ ses ?
i 'm still practic@@ ing in front of the mirror at least 1 hour a day to im@@ prove my pronunci@@ ation since my debut .
ga g@@ ya geo g@@ yeo , like a child learning the alphabet , with a pen between my teeth .
if you really felt a problem with your acting , you yourself have to know what it is to fix it .
no matter what other people tell you , you have to know it for yourself .
spend some time to think about it .
it doesn 't seem like a side effect of the anti@@ depres@@ sant .
there doesn 't seem to be a problem with your other tests .
then why does my vision get blur@@ ry sometimes ?
h@@ mm ... how about getting yourself test@@ ed at the op@@ thal@@ m@@ ology ?
i 'll ar@@ range it .
since you 're here already , why don 't you get test@@ ed .
tada ~ it looks nice .
what exactly is the problem ?
do you have a family member with poor ey@@ es@@ ight ?
yes .
that is correct .
is that your mother ?
yes , but how ? yes , you have le@@ ber 's her@@ edit@@ ary op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y that is matern@@ ally in@@ her@@ ited .
it progres@@ ses really fast with few pre@@ lim@@ in@@ ary symp@@ tom@@ s , so your right eye is already in bad shape .
looking at the pace of the condition , your right eye will lose its sight completely soon .
once that happens , unfortunately , even your left eye will ... eventually , you 'll lose sight in both your eyes .
wow , i hadn 't seen you in a while .
have you been well ?
yes , have you been well ?
yes .
would you like to order ?
well , i 'm waiting for someone today . when he gets here , i will .
did you get a boyfriend by any chance ?
no .
i 'm here .
where are you ?
i 'm here ...
where are you ?
in search of lost time
please leave a trace after reading the book .
( all entr@@ ies are by lee go e@@ un )
since your mother has this condition , you must know it very well .
there is no real way to cure it .
i regret to say this , but you should make prepar@@ ations before both eyes lose sight .
ah , what are you doing ?
!
can 't you pour the water proper@@ ly ?
my eyes sting !
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not eating !
why ?
does it taste bad ?
you eat it , mom .
you can 't even tell sugar and salt apart !
dum@@ my .
idiot !
excuse me .
i guess the traffic is bad .
um ... i 'm sorry , but we 're closing .
ah , yes ...
where did you go to be back so late ?
you ignored my text and my calls .
what is this ?
i 'm sorry .
well , was something the matter ?
yes .
my mother was not well .
omo . is she doing okay ?
well , if that 's what happened , why didn 't you tell me ?
well , i guess you didn 't really have the mind to do that .
get in .
since you so desperately wish to ren@@ ew my contr@@ act , i 'll do it .
let 's do that later .
it 's late . get back and rest .
lee go e@@ un ...
when did it start ?
your feelings for me .
i dece@@ iv@@ ed you .
i betr@@ ayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite all that , when did you start lik@@ ing me ?
episode 17 do not be afraid of the darkness i dece@@ iv@@ ed you . i betr@@ ayed you .
i was so mean to you . despite that , when did you start lik@@ ing me ? did something happen ?
nothing happened . get inside and rest . represent@@ ative !
why was he like that ?
what happened that he even had tears in his eyes ?
reg@@ ret@@ tab@@ ly , it looks like the initial diagno@@ sis still stands .
since your mother has this condition , you must know this already , but there is no way to cure it at this point .
* cur@@ r@@ ently , no cure is avail@@ able .
how to learn br@@ aille
you need to start getting ready for it .
normally , people with ac@@ quired blind@@ ness take about 3-@@ 5 years to ad@@ just to be able to per@@ form daily func@@ tions .
even just getting out of the house can feel like a form@@ id@@ able challenge .
from just grabbing a spo@@ on to going to the bathroom , you have to learn how to do them by yourself .
do you have family that could take care of you ?
what is the per@@ cent@@ age ?
the chance of me going blind .
i 'll ask one more question .
why is it me ?
my mom wasn 't enough ?
why are you even doing this to me ? i have finally found the reason why i must produce dram@@ as , and i have also found the person who pointed it out to me .
and yet , after all that , why did you choose me ?
tell me . if you 're there , tell me !
why is it me ?
why ?
!
ready .
action !
my face ... take a good look .
this face ...
don 't ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
i 'm sorry , but can we do it again ?
but your eyes were really good just now .
why ? no , my gaze at jin h@@ ye rin needs to be full of sad@@ ness ,
i don 't think it was enough this time .
alright then .
alright , let 's do it one more time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget .
cut !
okay !
director !
let 's do it one more time .
the director said it was okay .
why do you keep asking him to film it again ?
don 't p@@ ity me .
i 'm not saying this out of p@@ ity !
your eyes really did look sad ! i appreciate your comfor@@ ting words , but you have to clearly point out my fla@@ ws for my acting to im@@ prove so that i can become a good actor .
director !
let 's do it one last time .
carefully look at my face . this face , don 't you ever forget it .
cut !
how 's this one ?
you satisfied ?
yes .
i think it 's okay .
okay .
then , get ready for scene 38 !
sung mo !
script !
yes , hy@@ ung .
what 's wrong with him ?
did something happen ?
he wants to get better .
get better at what ?
acting skil@@ ls .
hy@@ un min said that ?
yes .
i 'm going to be worn out , it seems .
things to do from now on .
what are you doing ?
just some things .
can we speak ... for a bit ?
come to the book cafe where we were supposed to meet yesterday .
in search of lost time
after so much time has passed , she finally read@@ s the confes@@ sion the man had left in the book .
and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go e@@ un ♥ and even the book 's title is " in search of lost time "
lee go e@@ un ♥
when did you come ?
just now .
ah , i see .
i will answer the question you asked yesterday .
it 's true that i like you .
i don 't know since when , but it 's correct that i like you .
i will also ask one question .
yesterday ... why did you cry ?
there 's something wrong right ?
i 've been suff@@ ering from depression for three years .
that 's why i 'm crying , so it has nothing to do with you , so don 't mind it .
pretend that the issue of contr@@ act ren@@ ew@@ al never happened .
as if it never happened ?
what are you sud@@ d@@ ently talking about ?
there is one reason .
the relationship between a produc@@ er and writ@@ er should be up@@ right with the right amount of fear and respect .
since the moment you started lik@@ ing me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
then ...
what about sung min ah ?
you didn 't do that at that time .
but now it 's like that .
we can 't continue working together .
does that answer your question some@@ what ?
i will take my leave .
i have an important ap@@ pointment .
you 've come again .
hello !
who ... ?
the writ@@ er who came last time .
it 's good to meet you . i actually wanted to see you .
is your body fine ?
i heard you weren 't well yesterday .
did my son say that yesterday ?
ah ...
i guess i must 've heard wrong .
no@@ wad@@ ays is out of control because of the script .
you have a hard time because of my son right ?
no , he is so nice to me .
that 's good , that you think about him like that . he grew up with a blind single par@@ ent , so his person@@ ality is _ _ _ _ _ , but his heart is kind .
i heard ... that you couldn 't see when he was five ...
at that time ... my heart hurt so much ... at first , my vision started to get blur@@ ry , but i thought it would get better over time .
instead , one eye went blind , and the other eye ended up blind as well .
i found out later that that 's how op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y progres@@ ses .
at any rate , you must be a special person to my son .
huh ?
why do you think so ?
because he told you about things like that .
ah . to be honest ...
i confes@@ sed my feelings to the represent@@ ative .. .@@ and i got rej@@ ec@@ ted .
my son ... by nature , has no vision for women .
right ? !
i mean i 'm this pretty ...
i think he really doesn 't have an eye for girls .
what are you talking about ?
that doing business together is going to be hard ?
i 'm sorry .
can i ask the reason why you are refus@@ ing ?
it 's a personal issue , so i can 't tell you .
i hope that instead of me , you will find a good partner .
chil@@ dish ! say if you don 't like a person , you 're always nag@@ ging me about the script .
if you know , hurry up and write the script , everyone is waiting .
i am a crazy girl for wor@@ rying about bong dal .
cros@@ sing out " can@@ cel the invest@@ ment deal with ta@@ es@@ an "
morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ song end of episode 19
i sent the 19@@ th episode
got it .
ah ... it 's done , but ...
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min sure will compl@@ ain about the hair ...
the 19@@ th episode came out .
really ?
it came out a lot faster than i thought .
what ?
i guess hy@@ un min 's hair@@ style changes , to a shor@@ ter hair@@ cut .
what ? what , what , what ?
so you think getting him to cut his hair will be difficult .
could you please change that part this time ?
i 'm very sorry .
i was concerned about it , too , actually .
you don 't think you can persu@@ ade him ?
it is to signif@@ y the start of kim wo@@ o jin 's choice of an ordin@@ ary life .
to tell you the truth , hy@@ un min is cur@@ r@@ ently working on getting an en@@ dor@@ sement deal for a sham@@ po@@ o .
an en@@ dor@@ sement for sham@@ po@@ o ?
yes .
so , if he gets a hair@@ cut , he won 't be able to do it at all .
yes .
if it 's about an en@@ dor@@ sement deal , k@@ ang hy@@ un min sure wouldn 't want to cut his hair .
exactly !
i 'm sorry , miss writ@@ er .
i guess it can 't be helped .
i 'll change it .
really ? oh , thank you !
miss writ@@ er lee !
writ@@ er lee !
isn 't this hy@@ un min 's voice ?
- writ@@ er lee !
i guess he 's already come to compl@@ ain .
writ@@ er lee !
- don 't tell him that i was here !
writ@@ er lee !
open this door , now !
oh heav@@ ens !
what do you think ?
is this accep@@ table ?
you got a hair@@ cut !
of course .
a new wo@@ o jin style .
but , how did you ...
why ?
i got it cut after i saw the script .
do you want it shor@@ ter ?
just tell me !
well , mr. hy@@ un min , weren 't you after a sham@@ po@@ o en@@ dor@@ sement ... ?
who car@@ es about en@@ dor@@ sements ?
even if a tv or a car en@@ dor@@ sement deal is on the table , if it is for the drama , i should cut it !
with over@@ flo@@ wing spirit !
hy@@ ung !
what are you doing here ?
well , actually , to thank her for making your character so aw@@ esome .
that 's why i 'm here .
is that so ?
at any rate , writ@@ er lee , the last week of morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong will be full of this k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's imp@@ act@@ ful acting spirit , just you wait .
fighting !
fighting !
director nam , what do you mean by that ? you can 't exten@@ d morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong ?
to exten@@ d a drama that was origin@@ ally planned for 20 episodes into 24 all of a sudden will make everybody think that we 're only doing it for the rat@@ ings .
rather than that , just fin@@ ishing the drama with its current qu@@ ality seems to be the better choice , in my jud@@ g@@ ment .
listen , director nam . " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " has just gone over 25 % , and is on the ver@@ ge of getting into the 30 % range .
if we add 4 more episodes , we 'll get the rat@@ ing over 30 % for sure , how can you sug@@ gest not doing it ? however , if you just prol@@ ong the story , it will in@@ evit@@ ably lead to a drop in the qu@@ ality .
in that case , it may ru@@ in what we have accompl@@ ished so far with " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
director nam , are you crazy ?
do you know how much of the prof@@ its from commerci@@ als depen@@ ds on 1 % of the rat@@ ings ?
this isn 't a place of art !
this is a business that needs to make a profit ! well , director ... - director nam ,
i understand your point of view , director nam . but this time , i would like you to accept the opinion of the board members including myself .
four more episodes ?
yes .
i 'm surprised by your lack of enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m .
don 't produ@@ cer@@ s usually welcome extension de@@ als in a situation like this ?
yes , we 'll make the necessary prepar@@ ations .
then ...
why ?
does he think 4 is too short ?
no , no .
he says he 'll prepare for it .
if we add 4 more episodes , that means 4 more weeks from now , starting with episode 19 .
i wonder what the od@@ ds are for my ey@@ es@@ ight to last until then ?
could i really do it ?
no , i must do it .
please , hang on until then .
well now , i know how everybody must be tired , but since it 's been decided to exten@@ d the show , let 's do our best to the end ! yes !
fighting !
what do you think ? to spike up the last pit@@ ch , new wo@@ o jin style !
what 's with your faces ?
your hair ... why did you cut it so soon ?
excuse me ?
i cut it too soon ? well , we got an extension of 4 more episodes .
extension ?
yes .
well , to prol@@ ong the story , the ending will have to change .
hy@@ un min , since it 's been extended , let 's go for 30 % of the vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing !
i 'm coun@@ ting on you !
what were you doing , not being aware of the extension deal ?
my last big impact !
the new hair@@ cut of wo@@ o jin style !
how can you make it all into nothing like this ? ! hy@@ un min , at any rate , now that it 's been decided , let 's go for 30 % of vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ing , and get more money for the extended episodes .
isn 't that s@@ well ?
hy@@ ung , is money all your concern ?
from now on , don 't ever insul@@ t my passion and spirit for acting with mere money .
well , then , are you not going to ask for a raise ?
how much more did sung min ah ask for ? are you crazy ? you know that you 're sched@@ ul@@ ed for a movie right away , and yet you agreed to the extension ?
min ah , this isn 't just any movie , but a movie direc@@ ted by cho k@@ yu sik .
besides , you 're the lead act@@ ress .
you know fully well how your sched@@ ule won 't allow for both the drama and the movie .
isn 't it your job to make that sched@@ ule work ?
so , just do as i said .
who exactly is the reason why you 're doing this ?
is it for anthony ? or ,
k@@ ang hy@@ un min ?
is it because of him ?
listen carefully .
don 't ever stick me with that mor@@ on again !
got it ?
why do you keep bar@@ ging in when i didn 't call you ?
extension ?
yes .
but i just have one more episode to work on .
how can i add 4 more episodes ? in order to write those 4 episodes without sacrific@@ ing the qu@@ ality , we have to rev@@ ise the script for episode 19 you finished yesterday .
episode 19 ... uh ...
i know it won 't be easy .
however , from episode 19 to 24 , you may have to send it to us page by page so we can shoot right away .
the live shooting we had been trying so hard to avoid has now started .
you can do it , right ?
i will have to .
yes . as this is an emergen@@ cy , put extra effort and write with speed .
where are you going ?
why ?
well , last time , you came fully lo@@ aded even with health sup@@ pl@@ ements . i 'm not writ@@ er kim so@@ o hy@@ un or anything , i couldn 't possibly write on without discus@@ sing the p@@ lot , is what you had said .
we should discus@@ s the p@@ lot .
this is an emergen@@ cy .
i 'm not doing this because i have ul@@ ter@@ ior mo@@ tives .
did i ask ?
the new episode 19
i 'm glad that we got done so fast .
you have to keep this pace from now on .
ah , before you leave , could you get me a glass of water ?
are you asking me to do that for you ?
what can you do ?
the writ@@ er with high vie@@ wer@@ ship rat@@ ings is cur@@ r@@ ently busy writing .
what are you doing ?
can 't you see it 's over@@ flo@@ wing ?
you can 't even pour me some water ?
so don 't ask me to do it again !
did you do it on purpose ?
yes , that 's right .
just move !
it spil@@ led to the floor !
let 's go . just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give up ? sung mo , get your emotions into it !
go again .
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
what about your dream ?
you won 't give it up ?
ah , this isn 't working , either .
i need something to help me get into it .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
are you sure you won 't give up on your dream ?
as long as you are by my side . wo@@ o jin ,
wo@@ o jin hu@@ gs h@@ ye rin .
no , no , no !
i can 't practice at all like this .
can 't you stop now ?
you 've been at it for 4 hours already .
we even ski@@ pped lunch !
wait a minute .
why didn 't i think of this before ?
instead , i can only give you 2 days a week for your drama .
that 's the least you can do , min ah .
of course .
i understand .
miss sung min ah ?
you can answer it .
oh , there 's no need .
it 's not an important call .
the phone is turned off , so the vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail ...
ignoring my calls , huh ?
ok .
we have to start shooting in 2 weeks at the lat@@ est .
yes .
i 'm so sorry , director .
i 'll be right back .
why do you keep calling me ?
if only you had answered it the first time .
you 're the one who made me call you several times .
i 'm in a meeting with a film production .
that 's none of my concern .
just come to the shooting site right now .
shooting doesn 't start until 2 hours from now !
that 's why we should get together and practice !
if you don 't come now , i 'll call the film production myself , got it ?
bye !
he must have really lost his mind !
victory !
let 's go with this spirit !
sung mo !
i 'll be back , g@@ wang so@@ o .
hey , what about lunch ?
what should i do ?
i 'm so sorry , director .
looks like i have to go now for the shooting sched@@ ule today .
it 's ok .
you may go .
i 'm really sorry . i 'll talk to you later , director .
they must be really going great together .
yes ?
k@@ ang hy@@ un min and min ah , i mean .
yes ? ah , no , that 's not really ... at any rate , there must be no wedding announ@@ c@@ ements before the movie release .
yes ? just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
let 's leave .
just like any other ...
you 're here !
isn 't it really cold outside ?
let 's leave .
we should practice it like we 're really doing it !
on your feet !
practice is only practice .
this k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's acting is for real !
do you normally practice so casu@@ ally , miss sung min ah ?
if you really want to do it for real , get rid of that script first .
ok .
now , ready , action !
let 's leave . just like any other ordin@@ ary couple , let 's live like that .
are you sure you won 't regret ?
can you really give up on your dream and live on ?
as long as you 're with me .
wo@@ o jin ...
mr. k@@ ang hy@@ un min ...
i 'm so sorry !
we start shooting in 10 minutes .
what are you doing ?
go and clear up her mis@@ understanding !
is that pet@@ ty little mis@@ understanding that important ?
my burning passion for acting won 't die because of it !
now , one more time .
why do you have to be so extreme in everything ?
i e-@@ ma@@ iled you the script for episode 19 , mr. kim bong dal .
wow , he doesn 't even text me back any more .
start out@@ lin@@ ing episode 20 .
we can 't always work on it together .
since they 've worked for me , i know how s@@ killed and fa@@ ith@@ ful they are .
well , with your re@@ commen@@ dation , i know they must be good , sun@@ ba@@ e .
hm , looks like they have quite some experience ?
they 've gone through a lot in this field .
they 'll be a great as@@ set to you .
you have to pay them at least that much .
at any rate , why are you hand@@ ing over such great wor@@ kers ? ah , well , it 's because ...
yes , director .
i just needed to stop at the office .
yes , i 'll be there in about 2 hours .
hello ?
is this world production 's jo@@ o dong su@@ k pd ?
yes , but who is this ?
hello , i 'm calling on be@@ half of drama production company golden song .
we would like to offer you a position at our company with extra benef@@ its .
could we have a meeting ?
ah , uh , me ?
yes , i heard that you are very tal@@ ent@@ ed .
we 'll give you 20 % more than your current sal@@ ary . ah , yes , well , but , actually , i 'm cur@@ r@@ ently working on a project .
also , to leave my current company all of a sudden seems ... of course , we understand .
you can take your time to consider our offer while fin@@ ishing up with your current project .
we 'll contact you again .
what now ? you were so heart@@ broken by that girl , did something good happen ?
i just got a job offer from another drama production company . hey , you too ?
i got one , too !
me too !
what ?
we all got an offer from somewhere ?
even so , i want to keep working with represent@@ ative kim to the end .
i suppose i will , too .
at any rate , the sal@@ ary they offered was pretty temp@@ ting .
true , after all , our company is on the low side when it comes to sal@@ aries in this field .
speaking of which , i have a good idea .
the four of us can keep our lo@@ yal@@ ty , but let 's ask for a raise of 10 % .
or else , we 'll quit .
thre@@ aten him like that in f@@ ake ?
yes .
isn 't it great ?
i 'm in .
i 'm in , too .
are you in ?
in .
he 's in , too .
what are you doing so hud@@ d@@ led up together ?
represent@@ ative , i have something to tell you .
i 'll listen to it later .
i have something to say first .
once " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " is finished , i 'm going to close my company .
what ? i got a partner@@ ship offer from ta@@ es@@ an group , but they didn 't want to keep your employ@@ ment .
by ta@@ es@@ an ... one of the top , leading compan@@ ies in the country .
there@@ fore , everybody needs to look for a new job once the drama is over .
team leader park , you should calcul@@ ate the sever@@ ance fee for everyone and put it on my desk .
hey , what was that ?
did we just get back@@ stab@@ bed ?
i heard that wrong , right ?
no wonder he had been surpris@@ ingly nice to us lat@@ ely .
what was the number from that other production company ?
cros@@ sing out " transfer emplo@@ ye@@ es ( close the company ) "
sweet po@@ tat@@ o
what ?
what else ?
i just got done with episode 20 .
so , if you 're in the office , make a short trip to my studio .
what do you think ?
you did pretty well by yourself .
what ?
this doesn 't make sense .
where ? scene 38 , if h@@ ye rin is meeting with represent@@ ative k@@ ang , is she betr@@ aying wo@@ o jin again ?
ah , that 's because there is a surprise element later on .
it 's all explained in scene 56 .
what is it ?
ah , no , nothing .
what do you think ?
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read it to the end !
i read it all .
you just flipped the page , and you read it all ?
yes , spe@@ ed@@ reading .
besides , i said it 's good .
why are you compl@@ aining ?
just keep writing the script . starting tomorrow , we 'll have to go page by page .
moon@@ hwa university hospital , please .
your condition is progres@@ sing much faster than most other pati@@ ents .
unfortunately , your right eye has already lost it 's sight .
it 's already started for your left eye , too .
how long will it take ?
for the left eye to lose sight completely ?
no .
how much time do i have left ? it is difficult to say for sure , but looking at it 's current pace , somewhere between 4 weeks and 2 months from now , your left eye will lose sight as well .
the more i think about it , the ang@@ rier i get .
he was so car@@ eless and ru@@ de .
was i cl@@ ing@@ y or what ?
is reading this that hard ?
why does it have 2 sheets of page 3 ?
then , he didn 't get to see scene 56 at all .
what do you think .
am i right ?
yes , you did well up to the ending .
what ?
you didn 't even read to the end !
i read it all .
why did he lie like that ?
at first , my vision was just blur@@ ry a little .
i thought it would get better over time .
but one eye lost its sight , and eventually , the other one did , too .
what are you doing ?
it 's over@@ flo@@ wing !
what is it ?
no , nothing .
i found out later that that 's how op@@ tic neur@@ opath@@ y progres@@ ses .
this can 't be !
that 's not possible !
represent@@ ative !
are you inside ?
how to learn br@@ aille
what to do from now on : 1 . mother 2 .
lear@@ n@@ br@@ aille 6 .
care facil@@ ity for the blind
at least up until now , writ@@ er lee has been good about not making us do live shooting .
of course , that ends tomorrow .
yes .
it 's been 5 years since the last time i had to do that dog@@ ged live shooting .
director .
what is it ?
do you think you can finish morning of k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong if i am not here ?
what do you mean ?
can you do it ?
why ?
does that ta@@ es@@ an or whatever company want you to start working with them so@@ oner ?
yes ?
i heard from jo@@ o pd .
i heard that you got a partner@@ ship offer there .
ah , yes .
go if you must , but only after fin@@ ishing this .
even though i have been calling you crazy dog and made fun of you , this drama doesn 't work even for a day without you , represent@@ ative kim .
there@@ fore , until this is done , don 't even think about running away .
now , let 's pick up the pace !
it 's going to get dark soon !
- yes !
yes !
is the preparation for the move going well ?
i 'm talking about the move to ta@@ es@@ an group .
when will it be ?
ah , that matter ... i want to send flowers . when is it ?
well , the prior@@ ity at the moment is " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong . "
so just focus on the drama for now .
the date for the move hasn 't been decided yet ?
we 'll get to it eventually .
then ...
for@@ get@@ le@@ ego e@@ un
ther@@ el@@ ation@@ ship@@ bet@@ we@@ en@@ the writ@@ er@@ and@@ the@@ produc@@ er re@@ qui@@ res a balan@@ ced tension of fear and respect .
now that you have started to like me , that 's impossible .
working without any emotion , that is my rule .
and that rule is always important .
cros@@ sing@@ out " for@@ get@@ lee goe@@ un "
shall we go in ?
too much cold air isn 't good for you .
maybe in just a little bit .
hello !
you 're busy .
why did you come ?
i 'm not busy .
my emplo@@ ye@@ es are doing all the work .
still , as the represent@@ ative , you should be present in the work place .
you shouldn 't just leave all the work to your emplo@@ ye@@ es .
mom .
what ? when i was young , what was it like when i made fun of you and was mean because you couldn 't see ?
wasn 't it up@@ setting ?
when was that ... such a long time ago .
i 'm sorry , mom .
what 's the matter ?
did something happen ?
tell me .
did something bad happen to you ?
it 's nothing .
once my current drama is done , i might be off to ab@@ road because my business is going so well .
so stay still . since i might not be able to see your face for a while ,
i want to keep your face in my eyes .
oh , i see .
it 's a good thing that your business is going well .
instead of wor@@ rying , just go and return , because i will be fine .
your hands are cold .
let 's go inside , mom .
yes .
by the way , is that a new scar@@ f ?
yes .
i got it as a gift .
a gift ?
from whom ?
she beg@@ ged me not to tell you ... actually , to tell you the truth , i ... confes@@ sed my feelings to the represent@@ ative and got rej@@ ec@@ ted .
my@@ child just doesn 't have a good eye for women .
that 's right .
i 'm pretty like this .
i agree that he doesn 't have an eye for women .
i brought a present for you .
there 's a present ?
yes .
i kn@@ it it myself , it ke@@ eps you really warm in the winter .
if you look here , it says b d k .
b-@@ d-@@ k ?
yes .
bong dal kim .
you shouldn 't do that to such a nice young lady . if it 's because you have to go ab@@ road , tell her .
because it seems to me , she really is a nice girl .
where have you been ?
did you finish the script ?
it 's cold . instead of cat@@ ching cold again , go in .
how long were you going to conce@@ al it ?
until when were you going to conce@@ al the fact that you are going blind ?
you said it was depression .
you said it had nothing to do with me and it was none of my business .
correct .
it 's none of your business so beat it .
how can it not concern me ?
so what ?
what can you do for me ?
yes .
what you are saying about my not being able to see is correct .
i won 't be able to eat by myself or go to the bathroom .
i won 't be able to see the dram@@ as which i made .
or the scrip@@ ts either .
i won 't be able to see your face and where you are standing , and whether you are smiling or crying
i won 't be able to see .
is that why you are giving up ?
what if i say it doesn 't matter to me ?
for me , it doesn 't matter .
we have to en@@ dure lack of sleep , script by pages , and miser@@ able life to make sure there 's no shame in our every minute , every second and keep us reminded of who we are at this moment .
the last tape of " morning in k@@ ye@@ ong@@ se@@ ong " hasn 't made it to the edit@@ ing room yet .
even if it 's just 1 % of hope , that 's better than nothing .
a miracle is not something you wait for , but something you cre@@ ate .
the represent@@ ative , the represent@@ ative , on his way , had an accident ...
you must come back with that miracle !
the finale the last of the king , or the last king . where have you been ?
did you finish the script ? don 't catch a cold in this cold weather . hurry and go in .
until when are you going to hide that ? until when are you going to hide the fact you 're going blind now ? you said , what , depression ?
didn 't you say it 's none of my business so don 't bother ?
yes .
it 's none of your business , so back off .
why is it none of my business ?
so what ?
what can you do for me , then ? that 's right . as you said , it 's true that i won 't be able to see any longer .
i won 't be able to eat or go to the wash@@ room by myself . i won 't be able to see the dram@@ as i made , or your scrip@@ ts ,
or your face either .
even where you 're standing , even whether you 're smiling at me or crying ,
i won 't be able to see all of them .
is that why you 're giving up ?
what if i say it still doesn 't matter ?
i 'm saying it doesn 't matter to me .
it will be difficult ( for you ) to en@@ dure .
even so , i want to go that way .
let 's go together .
maybe , this will be my last time to see the sun@@ rise .
even if you can 't see , i will make you be able to feel it .
and beside you , i will be there .
even if you can 't see the dram@@ as you made , even if you can 't see my face or my drama , where you 're standing , whether you 're smiling at me or crying , i will see all of them .
since we came all the way here , will we have some time to sleep ?
what ... what did you say ?
why are you so startled ?
wa ... wait !
i ... am ... not that easy of a woman .
what are you thinking now ?
i 'm saying let 's take a short nap in the car .
considering that our way back home would be a great hard@@ ship , don 't you think we should take a nap ?
so vul@@ gar !
that 's right !
i 'm so vul@@ gar !
with this driving s@@ kill , how on earth did you get your driving license ?
i told you , this is the first time i 'm driving since i got the license !
to be precise , this is your second time .
what ?
once to come here , and second time to go back .
if it 's your second time , there should be some im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement .
you chic@@ kened out !
just look where you 're driving !
okay . from now on , for the entire 24 episodes including the extended 4 episodes , we should run around bus@@ ily making sure they will be ai@@ red with no accident .
even if we have to en@@ dure a life like a thir@@ d-@@ r@@ ater with light sleeping and pag@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ page scrip@@ ts , those minutes and seconds of our r@@ respec@@ tive moments will make us later remember our@@ selves in this right moment . the scrip@@ ts will be hand@@ led by writ@@ er lee and me , so pd jo@@ o , manager han , manager park and koo he@@ e j@@ ae , you guys take care of the film@@ ing sites . yes .
yes .
well , then do your best in your post .
got it ?
yes !
the real problem here is sung min ah , who is cur@@ r@@ ently film@@ ing both our drama and a movie . since sung min ah 's sched@@ ule isn 't favorable , you should write the script minim@@ iz@@ ing jin h@@ ye rin 's por@@ tion as much as possible .
you can do it , right ?
i will even kill jin h@@ ye rin if i have to at the last episode to make sure , so don 't worry .
the script for episode 20 arrived !
did you send it to all of the cast and staff as well ?
yes .
good . from now on , for all the scrip@@ ts we will rece@@ ive , we should film the scenes of min ah putting together as much as we can , so organize the sched@@ ule accor@@ d@@ ingly .
yes .
well , well , hurry up .
let 's run again !
yes .
kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin , kim wo@@ o jin ! sung mo , - how many scenes in total ?
it 's 52 vs 36 .
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , you have many more scenes !
finally , my effort is shining .
the real value of my acting on the screen finally touched writ@@ er lee . there@@ fore , sung mo , you should try , too .
find your f@@ law .
the one who doesn know about one 's self would never be able to im@@ prove .
sung mo , what is your f@@ law ?
well , i don 't know , my f@@ law is ...
hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids ?
hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids ?
that ...
you just need to go to the hospital to treat it . well , by the way , hy@@ ung , all those lines , will you be able to memor@@ ize them all ?
if there are only a few lines , that 's the problem , not the other way around .
taking this opportunity , i should clearly show k@@ ang hy@@ un min 's burning acting skil@@ ls !
let 's go .
at the begin@@ ing of episode 21 , jin h@@ ye rin is cap@@ tured by president k@@ ang .
to save h@@ ye rin , kim wo@@ o jin will fight alone against all the enem@@ ies .
so that we can film jin h@@ ye rin 's scenes at once , all together in a long take ?
exactly !
it can en@@ han@@ ce it 's dramat@@ ic tension and also help us manage the film@@ ing sched@@ ule .
k@@ ang hy@@ un min would have a hard time , though .
good , let 's proce@@ ed in that way .
but how are your eyes ? are they alright ?
the other side 's eye is still fine .
what are you doing now , not writing ?
okay .
ah , i think i 'm really a gen@@ ius , don 't you think so ?
but really ... when was it that you started to like ?
huh ?
when did you start to like me ?
what about you ?
i asked you first .
so , for me ... when there was the argument about plag@@ i@@ ar@@ ism , you ... you said ... you would believe me no matter what ...
what about you ?
i don 't remember .
it 's not fair !
i told you everything !
just write your script .
hurry up and tell me ! when was it ?
if you don 't tell me , i won 't write any more .
if you finish your script , then i will tell you .
that 's really low .
did you find that out just now ?
ready , action !
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment .
on that day when we first met at wo@@ o mi theater ...
the day we first met ...
cut !
i will do it again .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at wo@@ o mi theater , when we aim@@ ed a gun at each other ...
on that day ...
cut !
ah !
what was the next line ?
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at wo@@ o mi theater , on that day when we first met at wo@@ o mi theater , even the day when we aim@@ ed a gun at each other ...
cut !
hy@@ un min !
let 's read the script once and try again .
no , director !
i can do it !
let 's try again .
no , no .
let 's take a 5-@@ minute break .
ah !
i really memor@@ ized all !
just use a prom@@ p@@ ter . what ?
whom do you think is responsible for this ?
are you saying i should che@@ at for acting , while reading lines from a prom@@ p@@ ter ?
i was just trying to help .
no need .
you seem to think i can 't do this , but wait and see .
i will act perfectly after memor@@ iz@@ ing all the lines .
i have never forgotten about you , not even for a moment . on that day when we first met at wo@@ o mi theater , even on that day we aim@@ ed a gun at each other .
i have never forgotten about all of them , not even for a moment .
so , please , believe me .
i believe you .
this is the only choice to let us be together .
cut !
ok !
hy@@ un min ! everything was great , including your last stare !
ha ! of course , who am i ! ?
considering the speed of progress of your disease , it will be a bur@@ den if you keep working .
but there is something i must do .
if the blind@@ ness is un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , i 'm thinking to work as much as i can . actually , there is something i didn 't tell you because i didn 't want to give you too much hope .
rec@@ ently , in bas@@ com palmer eye institute in florida , u.s. , there was the first clin@@ ical tri@@ al of dna treat@@ ment for this disease .
its res@@ ult showed some pati@@ ents to be cu@@ red , even if its succes@@ s rate is really low . we don 't know when they will announ@@ ce the start of the second tri@@ al , and although when it is announced , it won 't be easy for you to be on the list , but i will try my best as well .
thank you .
go e@@ un !
mom is here .
oh , you 're here !
i 'm sorry , but i have to write the script and send it to the staff as soon as possible .
ge@@ ez , i won 't interrup@@ t , so just keep writing !
hey , do you have an assistant writ@@ er ?
no , why ?
then , why do you have two to@@ oth@@ brus@@ hes ?
oh , that is ...
i haven 't seen these before , either .
wait , aren 't these for men ?
no , no ... that 's not ... you !
by any chance , that bong dal or something , did you let him in here all the time ?
no , mom , that 's not the case !
oh , you 're here !
oh , you came at the right time .
represent@@ ative , you said you know the guy named kim bong dal .
please give me his contact detail .
ah mom , that 's not the case .
what do you mean that 's not the case ? here are two to@@ oth@@ brus@@ hes , and even a man 's lo@@ tion . these are clearly its evidence !
this bastard !
i have to see his face ! ah ...
mother ... there must be some mis@@ understanding .
the guy named kim bong dal isn 't that bad .
that 's why i 'm saying i will meet him .
mom , later , later , i will introdu@@ ce him to you later .
later my ass !
i can just call him myself now .
mom ... mom !
here it is !
bong dal !
mom !
it 's my alarm .
give it back to me !
ah , mom , so ... just leave !
can 't you see me not being able to work now ?
anyway , you !
this is a warning !
warning !
hello !
what is this ?
what do you mean ?
it 's a cup of coffee .
have some .
by the way , why did you write it yesterday ?
over there , on the pil@@ lar .
well , that 's because you seemed to have a really hard time , so i just wrote it on there .
is that all ?
then , of course , that 's all .
what else can it be ?
many women don 't know their own feelings .
fine . if your feeling for me is that deep , i won 't res@@ ist it any longer , not like i did before .
what did you say ?
you fell for me , right ?
please , don 't have such il@@ lus@@ ions !
you want to keep your pride ?
i also know well about women 's pride .
seriously ... what the ... cute . lovely .
there 's a lim@@ it to how sim@@ plem@@ in@@ ded you can get ...
what if he starts cl@@ inging to me like a le@@ ech ?
i 'm just laughing because of how ridiculous he is .
ridiculous ...
min ah .
oh , director !
i was meaning to call you as well .
i know you 're busy .
my sched@@ ules are st@@ acked because of the movie and the drama .
well i 'm calling for your next project which we discus@@ sed before .
what do you think to work for writ@@ er kim e@@ un so@@ ok 's drama ? ( of " secret garden " " a gentlem@@ an 's dign@@ ity " )
that 'd be excellent if we work with writ@@ er kim e@@ un so@@ ok !
but , did the rep@@ . agree to that ?
to work with writ@@ er kim e@@ un so@@ ok ?
oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ? what news ? oh ... did you not hear the news yet ... ?
what news ?
anthony has dec@@ lined ta@@ e san group 's offer due to personal reasons .

that 's correct .

hello .
the writ@@ er who gave you a scar@@ f present .
i know who it is by her voice .
welcome .
mom , i kept my promise .
okay .
what ... promise ?
there is something like that .
what is ... that promise ?
yes .
i 've just received a message from the u.@@ s .
please come to the hospital as soon as possible .
the second clin@@ ical tri@@ al 's patient list is announced .
you 're on that list . as i 've told you before , the possibil@@ ity to avoid your blind@@ ness is as low as a miracle , but let 's hope for that miracle .
ah , and the reason i asked you to come here ur@@ gently was because you need to leave tomorrow , right away .
tomorrow ?
yes .
among the subject pati@@ ents , there was one patient , who missed the tim@@ ing to treat and went blind in both eyes , so that 's why you could be on that list instead of that patient .
to meet the due date per florida time , you must leave for florida tomorrow .
what is that expression about ?
i never dre@@ amed before

- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
no , he - not l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
bir@@ on l@@ apo@@ in@@ te wouldn 't have left prin@@ ts all over the place
check if they match bir@@ on 's file and we have to find him right now

what the lambert case did for l@@ apo@@ in@@ te 's career , this sco@@ op will do for yours , honey

l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ; do you really think
- you think he would have shared the spot@@ light on a case like this ?
- don 't rely on appe@@ aran@@ ces
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te is a bit har@@ sh sometimes but deep down he 's a good guy
- emile , without that sco@@ op , his career is over
- that 's why it w@@ ou@@ id be a rotten thing to

don 't you get it ?
they sent him to great bear to get rid of him , he said so himself

- bir@@ on ?
why ?
- they think he 's got comprom@@ ising documents
- comprom@@ ising for who ?
- for national security why , i don 't know yet but it has to do with the helicop@@ ter accident that killed the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ten years ago
- that ugly statue in front ?
- yeah , that 's it in fact , they have no inten@@ tions of letting me go until they have bir@@ on and the documents
- ok , so what am i doing here ?

while they were inter@@ rog@@ ating me , i over@@ heard some in@@ fo :
listen at ten o '@@ ci@@ ock sharp
- w@@ ou@@ id@@ n 't it be better to tell them to send bac@@ kup ?
- if they learn what 's going on , not only do i lose the case i 've dedi@@ cated my i@@ ife to , but you '@@ ii lose your eyes , ears and what 's left of your balls ; in that order
in eight seconds
special agent cor@@ be@@ ii , colonel
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette and robert bei@@ iv@@ eau are also present
i 'm fully aware this is a delicate case , but i have the situation under control
pa@@ qu@@ ette and bei@@ iv@@ eau can test@@ if@@ y to it

you '@@ ii end up with three months and community service , maximum
- no , gast@@ onne i lied to you
i did read the documents
they '@@ ii want to kill me , i swear !
they already have killed a dozen others ;
- what were those papers ?
- your friend bir@@ on didn 't tell you ?
- he didn 't read them
anyway , i want to hear it from you
what happened to the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ?
of course : you never trust@@ ed me
you 're not about to start today
- you want me to trust you but - yes
- can you keep a secret ?
it wasn 't supposed to be that way
they asked me for twelve guys , prefer@@ ably un@@ emplo@@ yed , with no w@@ ives , no kids
- no future
- i ran an ad :
" dangerous job , lots of quick money "
i knew exactly who would show up
before they got on the helicop@@ ter ,
cor@@ be@@ ii offered them five times their pay if they agreed to particip@@ ate in an exper@@ iment
they all signed up
sam first
after a few days , i went up to see what was going on
the guys had lost their min@@ ds
when i got a hold of sam
come on !
come on sam !
sam , sam , listen listen sam
you have to get out of here while you still got cell@@ s !

that 's the sent@@ ence which got us started on the right track
- yes , i know
i liked sam
you see where feelings get you ?
you always say i have a heart of stone
but i got sam out ; that pro@@ ves
please , don 't make me regret the only time i followed my heart
- you already regret it
you can 't turn your father in
help me
you 're a cop dad
you 're supposed to protect people
- you 're the only person i can count on
- you say i 'm not a good cop
take a look at yourself
- they '@@ ii lock me up for the rest of my i@@ ife for a mistake that , even if i wanted to , i can 't fix

- i '@@ ii calm down when the deal 's done and when arm@@ and is
- never mind arm@@ and stephanie doesn 't want him anymore ; he has nothing left here he '@@ ii leave on his own
- i don 't understand why we should give him his share
- because you don 't rob a guy from the i@@ ast thing he 's got
you of all people should know that
- aside from that , i have a problem with catherine
- be patient with her
there are a iot of things you don 't know about her
i asked her to marry me
- huh ?
- you heard me
- you asked her
and what did she answer ?
- i io@@ ve her and don 't take me wrong but i io@@ ve her more than i ever loved your mother
that journalist is coz@@ ying up to her
he '@@ ii get out of the way , trust me
- is that why we 're here , so you could tell me this ?

- you got it dad let 's go get it
- thanks for the flowers , last night
and the note
- you weren 't home
- i was there
- i 'm going a little too fast , is that it ?
- georges , my sister 's husband , thinks that once you know me better , you '@@ ii dum@@ p me
- isn 't he a little bi@@ ased ?
- still , he 's probably right
- do you really think this is a sex game ?
honestly catherine ;
i 'm not twenty years old anymore
although i might appear to be
- there 's no age for chas@@ ing skir@@ ts
but that 's not the point
- oh , by the way i 'd rather you wouldn 't be at the gala , tonight
i 'm about to do something that i wouldn 't want you to see
- and i 'm about to show you something i never thought i cou@@ id show
- catherine , what 's wrong ?
i don 't know what you want to show me but can it wait ?
- i won 't have the courage twice

figh@@ ts , special attr@@ actions and the participation of a surprise celebr@@ ity
attention , everyone
- i 'm fed up , man
we should have recor@@ ded it

- why don 't you shut up ?
- when will you learn to mind your own business ?
- what is he@@ ien@@ e doing in the inter@@ rog@@ ation room , have you seen what state she 's in ?
- she appeared on tv , i@@ ike the other three , we 're looking for a connection
- in the mean time , what do we do about mar@@ cou@@ x ?
it 's been three days since he disappeared
- i won 't send out a search party every time a che@@ ated husband slam@@ s the door
- but dad , it 's mar@@ cou@@ x
- i '@@ ii tell you one last time gast@@ onne ;
you take things too personal
if you want to become any good at this job
- you think i 'm no-@@ good too ?
- what you need to be a cop is a cool head , common sense and a gun
you 're my daughter but all you 've got is the gun
mon@@ ette ?
mon@@ ette it 's me
say , do you know wrestling ?
what the hell is a " death hammer " ?
- so , how are things going ?
any head@@ way ? - i 've wast@@ ed my time
they have no idea why they appeared on tv and they have nothing in common
aside from the we@@ ir@@ do and the ny@@ m@@ ph@@ om@@ ani@@ ac , they barely know each other
the box@@ er is a re@@ tard
the bi@@ -@@ gen@@ dered hair@@ dres@@ ser is completely insan@@ e
the woman only talked about her husband who left her
and the kid wasn 't saying anything
- what have you learned since you 've been here ?
- what is blo@@ cking the tv signal is a magne@@ tic field
- yes but we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmit@@ ting from
the ant@@ enna on the mountain ?
- i checked
to loc@@ ate the source , we would need to intercep@@ t the signal
this means clim@@ bing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmit@@ ting at that moment
- i 've already called georges fer@@ ron to go with you
bei@@ iv@@ eau and i , we have to prepare a first report , and we have nothing to give them
so if you find anything new
hello ?
- hello my handsome christian

- no , i don 't understand
pierre ?
- her girlfriend is a hair@@ dres@@ ser

- thanks
- don 't let it get to you
they 're all afraid they are fre@@ aks too , on the inside
they all are a little , and they know it

- when blanche was here , we could just go see her
- hey , it 's starting !
ladies and gentlem@@ en !
welcome to
- in the spot@@ light , idiot
- welcome to the von trie@@ ck hang@@ ar , site of the most incredi@@ ble entertainment
- this better be worth it , bi@@ an@@ che , or you '@@ ii hear from me in the great beyond
- and now ladies and gentlem@@ en , the first fight of the evening will oppose : in the blue corner ,
" bobby the mayor " bei@@ iv@@ eau
and in the red corner , " luigi big star " l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
that wasn 't in the script
- hey , i just had a con@@ cus@@ sion here
- people are supposed to ro@@ ot for me
- be careful
put everything exactly back where you got it
if he notic@@ es anything , we 're done for
- will we have time ?

- mrs
why didn 't you tell me ?
- pierre , help me !
help me !
- blanche ?
you were right
" where the thie@@ f dances "
- i didn 't know what the sent@@ ence meant when i wrote it
- but you were right
- if you want but now i 'm here to tell you i was wrong
- tell me everything
who killed you , who killed dr the tv , the book
- you 're the one who must answer those questions
a@@ ii i can tell you now is this :
i 've already told you about the books in which each generation of wit@@ ches writ@@ es her disco@@ ver@@ ies
i have also told you that most of us want to do good , not evil
unfortunately , every thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h generation , there is an evil witch
she writ@@ es the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter , a bloody chapter , full of ma@@ ie@@ dic@@ tions
- mom ! stop !
stop , she can 't take it anymore !
- for thirty years , i wrote the twel@@ f@@ th chapter of my book
i couldn 't accept that when i died i would have to give my powers to an evil one
so i decided to change the course of things and to ski@@ p the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
i chose my son 's wife
she accepted to sub@@ mit herself to a i@@ ong and hard treat@@ ment
she fought alone against a thousand demons
i pushed her to the end , in the ho@@ pes to save a generation against forces of evil
- leave di@@ ane alone , is that clear ?
- i failed
thomas lost his wife
sarah lost her mother
the whole town lost a friend
one last thing
the last vic@@ tim will serve as a com@@ pass
- the last vic@@ tim will serve as a com@@ pass
thanks pierre
now listen
- apparently there are a iot of be@@ ars in the area
- yeah
a iot
- november 5@@ th , vote bei@@ iv@@ eau
- and now , the moment you have been waiting for ;
the fight oppos@@ ing , in the red corner , the former canadian champion , medium weight :
jean-@@ guy poit@@ ras
and in the blue corner
you ! - dad !
dad you can 't let that happen
he doesn 't have a per@@ mit for this
- come on , can you see me trying to take away their show ?
they already hold me responsible for the tv
- dad , you can 't , you can 't !
- leave me alone
- ok , you 're right
good night - calling me a fa@@ g , huh ?
very brave when you 're twelve against one with baseball bat@@ s , but face to face
come on you co@@ wards , i have one hand tied behind my back
come on , big guy , iet 's go !
- you put everything back exactly in its place ?
- yes perfectly
- we have a volun@@ te@@ er ladies and gentlem@@ en :
rick cy@@ r
- a@@ ii right !
hey
- thanks bir@@ on
cor@@ be@@ ii , we have a problem
- what do we do now ?
- we wait
hoping that the mad@@ man who transmit@@ s on great bear 's waves sen@@ ds another episode
- the mad@@ man might be just a jo@@ ker
- trust me
to do what he does , one must be der@@ ang@@ ed
- and you desig@@ ned the dev@@ ice ?
you experiment@@ ed on humans ?
- i was doing research on mental imag@@ ery
cor@@ be@@ ii 's the one who pushed me
- she stroked my ego
i was going to make history
national security offered me a labor@@ atory , volun@@ te@@ er test subj@@ ec@@ ts
i fell for it
- quit wh@@ in@@ ing
do you know what 's going on ?
- someone pushed my research further
i was able to read the ner@@ ve influ@@ x of the rats to project images
but i was never able to search their memories
i never had the intention to broad@@ cast
- so the rab@@ bits on tv
- they must have been test subj@@ ec@@ ts
- but what we 've been seeing on tv that doesn 't come from the mind of a rab@@ bit
what we 've been seeing on tv , log@@ ically , must have come from the mind of blanche von trie@@ ck
except that she 's dead
- i don 't know exactly how but just before her death , the mad@@ man was able make an electronic copy of her brain
it 's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- that guy isn 't a mad@@ man , he 's a gen@@ ius
- yeah , a gen@@ ius ! who has already killed at ie@@ ast two people :
von trie@@ ck and dr
- how many have you killed ?
- i never killed any@@ body , i stopped
they wanted me to continue but i refused
- but still , you must have an idea of who might be doing this ?
- it has to be someone who knows my research
those guys are scat@@ tered all over the world
except le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais who 's dead
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais ?
- a signal
we '@@ ii loc@@ ate the transmit@@ ter
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais ?
no ! no !
- so
you got to grande our@@ se two days ago
- you 're sending me to a hole
- out of the blue , you ended up at blanche von trie@@ ck 's
- i was waiting for you
- then you took a night str@@ oll with the old woman
- i don 't know the meaning of these sent@@ ences but i know they will help you , one by one , to save my soul
- and mine
it 's been a i@@ ong time since i 've seen such a beautiful women
i thought the clu@@ es were leading me to a criminal
- the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass
- in reality , they were leading me to you
- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
bi@@ an@@ che 's killer it 's catherine
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ! it 's catherine !
it 's catherine , l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
catherine open the door !
i know you 're there
- georges
- no catherine !
- catherine !
- get in i have to talk to you
i know
- no , i know
- stephanie
ste@@ f
- soon it won 't hurt anymore , you '@@ ii see
- yes , i need an ambul@@ ance at the la for@@ ge hotel , room number two
it looks like a heart attack , hurry up
they 're on their way georges
- catherine is not a woman for you
you don 't know her
you don 't know anything about her
- forget about that ok ?
don 't think about that
- listen
she 's the one i io@@ ved
she was 15 , i was 24
i was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off suz@@ anne first , her older sister
it was catherine 's idea ,
i swear
catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
but don 't think she didn 't love her sister
she ado@@ red her
it was for her she did all this
suz@@ anne was der@@ ang@@ ed , almost always off in her own world
she would have ended up alone , un@@ happy
catherine sacrific@@ ed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
it went wrong when catherine got pregnant
she cried for weeks , but to protect her sister , she decided to have an abor@@ tion
in those days , thomas von trie@@ ck 's wife was blanche 's apprent@@ ice except that she was using what the learned from blanche to do black magic
catherine went to see her
but the abor@@ tion didn 't work
she went off to montreal to have the baby
he was born a veget@@ able and a gim@@ p
she never for@@ gave herself
she hid him
and she became ob@@ ses@@ sed she dedi@@ cated her life to finding a way to cure our son
she never succe@@ eded
she 's only been back in great bear for two , three years
i thought things were better
- georges where can i find her ?
- you won 't find her
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais 's b@@ imbo is here
- yes , that 's it
it looks like catherine , fer@@ ron 's si@@ ster@@ -@@ in-@@ i@@ aw
- and his mist@@ ress
- yes , exactly
- fer@@ ron i knew he did it on purpose
- pa@@ qu@@ ette , couldn 't you have thought of that ?
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais 's girlfriend ? she couldn 't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amo@@ eba
at least she didn 't look like it
- bei@@ iv@@ eau ?
- yes ?
- not you , your daughter
very good work , bei@@ iv@@ eau
i will person@@ ally see that your efforts be re@@ war@@ ded by a promotion
- thanks
- this is a very serious case
you saw what happened in great bear , on a small scale ?
if the disco@@ ver@@ ies of what 's her name ?
- catherine lap@@ i@@ ante
- if lap@@ i@@ ante 's disco@@ ver@@ ies were found out , if they ended up in the wrong hands
do you understand ? - yes
- we have to act quickly so that despite a few err@@ ors commit@@ ted in the past , the information concer@@ ning this case re@@ mains secret
- that i can 't
- sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the les@@ ser of two ev@@ ils
in this case , it 's better to leave the death@@ s of a few i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s un@@ pun@@ ished than to risk that dangerous technologies end up in the hands of terror@@ ists , or
- got it !
i found the coordin@@ ates of the transmit@@ ter that broad@@ cast@@ ed those images last night
- forget what you know about the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
it won 't bring them back ;
it 's all in the past we need you , right now
- you won 't regret it , captain bei@@ iv@@ eau
- chief , someone st@@ ole a body from the mor@@ gue
- who 's body ?
- blanche
a bunch of people took her
they 're fre@@ aking out because of the tv they want to bury her
- come on !
- bei@@ iv@@ eau , i want my law@@ yer !
i want my law@@ yer !
i want my law@@ yer
- buy us some time
let him see arm@@ and but no one else
- catherine ?
- what are you doing here ?
- i was looking for stephanie
she got in the car with catherine and i can 't find her
what 's this ?
- catherine it can 't be true
- what ? - bir@@ on is in danger , your stephanie too
- what do you mean , in danger ?
- come on , i '@@ ii explain on the way
- he 's my ste@@ p@@ brother ?
- genet@@ ically , ach@@ illes is even closer to you since i 'm your mother 's sister
but there isn 't a name for that , except " bastard "
- when i found out you 're the one who killed mom , i wanted to kill you catherine , i swear
but now
- reven@@ ge doesn 't make the pain go away
only for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess can
but people are too weak to forgive
you '@@ ii feel so much better after
- so , now it 's party time
- i '@@ ii sleep here tonight
take me out for dinner and
- right
- the images that appeared last night were broad@@ cast@@ ed from here
- that 's close to the old mine
- i '@@ ii take a gps , i '@@ ii manage
but make sure your daughter st@@ ays on our side until bir@@ on has his accident
after that she won 't be able to do anything
this might be a very important day , boys !
- what do you think she '@@ ii do once she can search any@@ body 's brain ?
- she '@@ ii spread joy all around the world
- chief !
chief !
- what ? what is it ?
- it 's bir@@ on
he hung himself in his cell
oh no !
help !
somebody ! hurry !
open the door ! un@@ lock the door !
oh my god !
ok , i got him go call an ambul@@ ance , quick !
- hold on , hold on
- i 'm proud of you son
you hand@@ led it like a pro
i can go in peace now
- c '@@ mon dad
- christian , all i have is yours now
but take care of your sister
- don 't say that dad , our business has just started
we '@@ ii get more wad@@ s like these , you '@@ ii see
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing
- no , i know there 's something , what is it dad ?
- it 's ok son , it 's experience
- what ?
- counter@@ fe@@ it
- that two-@@ tim@@ ing little tram@@ p !
- calm down christian
- well , thanks guys
- i 've had this har@@ ness since i played the hanging of louis-@@ ri@@ ei in a college play and now ; an escape
- well , it wasn 't a@@ ic@@ atra@@ z , but still
- so now we have to go to the mor@@ gue , we have to find stephanie
- the mor@@ gue ?
- yes , because the real " last vic@@ tim " was dr mon@@ dou@@ x
there 's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to ste@@ f - so , he knows everything now ?
- you 're the one who wanted to split
- yeah but still not two days ago he was " that little br@@ at " and now - get out
- no problem
- the only reason i got you out of there was because i thought your life was in danger because of what you read on the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s - i didn 't read anything
- hey !
don 't give me that shit
when they got a hold of you , you were fle@@ eing to montreal with the sco@@ op
- yeah
- don 't worry bir@@ on , at your age , in those circum@@ stances ,
i would have done the same
- really ?
- but what hur@@ ts me is that you didn 't tell me face to face
- i i know
- yeah
- now , don 't tell me you didn 't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or i i '@@ ii never speak to you again
i really wouldn 't have taught you anything
- well
i took some digital pictures
i have them all right here , on mini-@@ disc
- that 's my bir@@ on !
ok , now you can go
- go where ?
- to montreal
- no , i can 't go alone ; you have to come with me
- no , your time has come
you wanted your chance : you got it
- no , no , i couldn 't
- listen ,
i came here to save my soul , not my career
remember ?
- yeah , right
- look , saint-denis will pick you up in half an hour at the cro@@ ok@@ ed lake , ok ?
one last thing
listen , a i@@ ong story but
catherine killed blanche and the doctor
- what ?
no
didn 't i tell you not to trust her ?
you really liked her didn 't you ?
i 'm really sorry
- take care of yourself
- yeah , thanks for everything
- what do you mean , the mor@@ gue is closed ? - they 've already stol@@ en a body
- who 's ?
- blanche 's
they 're gone to bury or cre@@ mate her
they 're the only ones left
- it 's dr mon@@ dou@@ x we want to see
- impossible
- the last vic@@ tim wait !
look these are the marks from pa@@ qu@@ ette and catherine 's dev@@ ice he 's the i@@ ast vic@@ tim
but what does it mean , " the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass " ?
- arm@@ and , if i 've learned one thing here it 's that sometimes
" the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass " simply means the i@@ ast vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass
- are you sure ?
- do you have another way to find catherine and stephanie ?

you know , at first , i did all this for ach@@ illes
with neur@@ ology , i was trying to find a way to talk to him to tell him that if i cou@@ id start over
but i can 't
so i wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
i didn 't want blanche to die i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another

i can lose them all but not this one
- you 've already all read blanche 's book
- yes
- blanche wanted to ski@@ p the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h generation , the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter , the evil one , so she could pass on her powers to someone good
but she failed
that 's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exist@@ s
it will always ex@@ ist
we have to keep fighting it , all the time , whether it 's inside or outside of our@@ selves
- ok , but
who would be the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h ?
the bad one ?
- yeah , who 's the hei@@ ress of blanche 's powers ?
- for me , there 's no doubt
she 's the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h
sarah von trie@@ ck
- don 't you think you 've done enough , pierre ?
first , you dis@@ respect my mother 's body , and now , her grand@@ daughter
this little girl is gri@@ ev@@ ing so much since her grandmother died that she hasn 't said a word
and you want to make her out to be a demon ?
- she 's the one i tell you
i 'm sure , she 's the one
didn 't you hear that ?
she said she wants to kill me !
didn 't you hear ?
- that 's enough pierre go have yourself examin@@ ed
leave us alone

you '@@ ii all regret it
- you want to burn her right here ?
- yes
- let 's finish this
- it 's over now
let me help you
- go
you
stay here

- i never hid that i hid things
- true
- that i was a monster ?
- no , that 's not it
- admit it , i am a monster in your eyes now , i@@ ike in my own
- no , no , no catherine , no

come on , we 've got to get help
- would you forgive me ?
- i can tell you 're going to break my heart
that , i 'm warning you , i won 't forgive you for
- it 's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- is this a challenge or a warning ?
- a bit of both
i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
- catherine , it 's us@@ eless now
- right
it 's us@@ eless
- samuel ?
- mar@@ cou@@ x ?
bi@@ an@@ che ?

- the body seems to have been parti@@ ally buried then dragged on the ground
- you went str@@ ol@@ ling outside with the old woman , in the middle of the night , without any appar@@ ent reason
a@@ ii of a sudden , a kind of shadow att@@ acked you you fain@@ ted and you never saw her alive again
- mr mayor : you deserve nine out of ten
- sir ? you lost this
you '@@ ii be ne@@ eding it

i 'm not a fa@@ g
somebody fired a shot
my god , sophie , i 'm sorry
is there anything i can do ?
not one word on what happened , ok ?
i heard a shot , i came right away but there was no one here
he shot himself before someone else did
don 't say that , the guys aren 't crazy
they wouldn 't have killed him for a couple gr@@ ants
you think ?
not for that either :
look
" i 'm not a fa@@ g "
can you believe it ?
what were you all doing here ?
well
we all ga@@ ther here to talk about blanche
i 've invit@@ ed you before
bi@@ an@@ che is dead
so ?
we can still talk about her
you believe she transmit@@ ted her powers , i@@ ike she said ?
don 't you ?
i believe in what i see
and these days , the picture isn 't very nice
bi@@ an@@ che also believed in what she saw except she saw a iot more and a iot further than we do
i know you 've secre@@ tly been to see her too
i beg your par@@ don ?
once or twice
out of curio@@ sity , i@@ ike everyone else
when the bear grow@@ ls , it will be exactly 9@@ am
you 're tun@@ ed in to great bear radio , with simone le@@ ten@@ dre
so , mr mayor ?
everything is under control

i can 't keep people from shooting themselves
i mean
i 'm deeply sorry for the famili@@ es it 's trag@@ ic
as for mrs von trie@@ ck , i 'm gri@@ ev@@ ing like everyone else
the investig@@ ation is under way but let 's not put the horses before the car@@ t
- ha ! the horses
- still , she 's the most liked and respec@@ ted woman in town
any lead@@ s ? suspec@@ ts ? anything at all ?
- horses in front of the car@@ t
- the prior@@ ity is the safety of the population
we obviously have several lead@@ s , i can 't give any details
- come on ! come on !
give them details !
- people seem to think that you don 't know the details
what people ?
- everybody
- and what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
people would i@@ ike to know when it will come back
i made a call to compet@@ ent author@@ ities this morning to have them send us their top exper@@ ts
in my days , there was no television
- in other words , you have no clue what 's going on
well thank you mr mayor for the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment - that 's right !
thank you very much you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who sav@@ ag@@ ely killed our bel@@ o@@ ved blanche
- poor blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
i 'm starting to understand her
too bad i 'm leaving ; i cou@@ id have told you what to do with her
never mind simone
you can 't leave ;
you 're a wit@@ ness in a murder investig@@ ation
might as well make the most of it and do a story
bir@@ on , i 'm tired , i need some rest
- do you think we ever got any rest ?
we worked twelve hours a day and at night
nothing ever happens in great bear
then , you come here , there 's a murder , a man@@ hunt , su@@ ici@@ des , tv fre@@ aks out
bir@@ on i have nothing to do with your far@@ fet@@ ched tales

are you writing po@@ etr@@ y ? - po@@ etr@@ y is bor@@ ing
but at christmas time , sometimes we 'd sing songs
- yeah , that 's it i write po@@ etr@@ y
don 't forget what blanche said ;
your fate is lin@@ ked to hers
my fate i 'm not dead
what is a dead person 's fate ?
- poor blanche
- follow me , i '@@ ii show you
- we 'd sing what was it that we 'd sing ?
" the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round "
the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round
she got me the old bat !
she got me
and the elections are coming up
fan@@ at@@ ics ;
it could cost me my mayor 's job
bi@@ an@@ che was all that 's good in the world , all put together in the same person , who would listen to them and guide them
she told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - no way !
- how would you know ?
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te 's de@@ position
yeah , that 's what he told me at the hospital , word for word
big surprise !
why would it have changed ?
what did they te@@ ach you at police academy ?
why would he lie ?
bi@@ an@@ che left him a paper with clu@@ es we should follow
hey , the case is mu@@ ddy enough without me wor@@ rying about the old woman 's hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations
forget it !
about suz@@ anne fer@@ ron ; i 'm starting to think i 'm wast@@ ing my time
pro@@ of@@ s were er@@ ased , pur@@ po@@ sely you don 't say ?
by the way the cle@@ an@@ ers will be there tomorrow morning , before thomas gets out of the hospital
in the mean time , don 't touch anything and keep your nose out of it

i 'm sorry about blanche

i 've got an idea
fantast@@ ic ?
extraordin@@ ary ?
insan@@ e ?
a@@ ii of the above !
do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us ? because of what we did with blanche 's book ?
of course not
gilbert thi@@ bo@@ deau never needed any help to get into trouble
i don 't feel so good since blanche is gone
everything is back@@ wards and
i 'm scared
you 're too sensit@@ ive honey
bi@@ an@@ che wouldn 't have liked us playing with forces we can 't control
sophie was putting us on
you really think she left her body and saw blanche with wi@@ res coming out of her head ?
she rose above the table , you saw her
well , iet 's keep that between us for now , ok ? yeah
wait for me ; i '@@ ii give you a lift
i 've never felt that way in all my i@@ ife , pierre
i felt myself leave

what 's the matter ?
hey !
if you 're gay too , then i 'm the one who 's gon@@ na shoot myself
no , that 's not it
i just can 't ! you 're played the te@@ ase long enough
at first , it turned me on but it 's not funny anymore , pierre
it wasn 't my intention sophie , i 'm sorry
if it 's because of gilbert , you know there was nothing left between us i have to go
pierre , i need a man !
i need you
hurry up bir@@ on ; i 'm having a shit@@ ty day
you better have a good reason to bring me back here

there 's no ant@@ enna , nothing to rece@@ ive the waves , it takes it 's signal from the v@@ cr
bir@@ on , i know what a monit@@ or is
ok , now , look at this
indeed
look at that

wait wait wait

there
well
i '@@ ii be damned it 's that bear
the old woman 's stu@@ ffed bear
that 's right
bi@@ an@@ che 's didn 't tape her me@@ et@@ ings with people
no , but there 's something there
there 's got to be a link between blanche 's murder and poit@@ ras and the tv
and the rab@@ bits that appeared during poit@@ ras ' fight
- well , why not ?
it would be log@@ ical i don 't know if it 's log@@ ical but it remin@@ ds me that something 's not right with your de@@ position
bi@@ an@@ che 's big book you were talking about ;
the night she was killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
yes , the book
very nice , with a leather bin@@ ding
we search@@ ed everywhere ;
well , the killer took off with it then ?
i 've got an idea come on bir@@ on
hey ! wo@@ ah !
what idea ?
i don 't work for the police but you 're still a susp@@ ect
it 's to your advantage to cooper@@ ate
you '@@ ii get the auto@@ p@@ sy report on the old woman ?
give us a copy and we '@@ ii tell you what we have found on our end
ok , ok
but not a word to my father eh ?
i 'm not supposed to get involved in that
no , no , no
we have a story now , don 't we ?
what 's your idea ? to get the auto@@ p@@ sy report
that 's a good one
but what do we do for gast@@ onne ;
we 've got nothing for her you see bir@@ on ; we have to re@@ constitu@@ te the events of that night , right ?
we have to speak with blanche 's son ; he was in the house too
the auto@@ p@@ sy report should help us re@@ construc@@ t the fac@@ ts and put the pieces together
ah , cool but what do we do for gast@@ onne ?
i have to take a shower , bir@@ on
come on , iet 's go
a gala ?

what 's up with you ?
did you call me here to talk about my war@@ dro@@ be ?
no i want to know how mom died
you know it , dad knows it and i don 't know why you 're protec@@ ting him
if he 's threaten@@ ing you , you 'd better tell me
i '@@ ii help you that time is over ste@@ f
i don 't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
if someone falls down , you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
and when they 're too much of a bur@@ den
you take off
look at me look at mom
you 're such an as@@ sh@@ ole
oh yeah ! that 's another thing ;
i 'm done being nice

- excuse me stephanie ;
i 'm looking for dr mon@@ dou@@ x
it 's for an auto@@ p@@ sy report
my mother 's ?
no blanche 's
because your mother yes , she was inc@@ iner@@ ated the same night
i know everybody knows
yeah
anyway
don 't bother gast@@ onne , it 's us@@ eless now
according to mon@@ dou@@ x , she was parti@@ ally buried , and then dragged for a good distance after her death
why would a killer bring his vic@@ tim back in her own house ?
i don 't know
yeah
these marks are ident@@ ical to the ones you 'd find on the skin of people on whom they test@@ ed a dev@@ ice invent@@ ed by a certain doctor edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
edouard who ?
pa@@ qu@@ ette
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
mon@@ dou@@ x has tried to contact him but he couldn 't get a hold of him
- no , no tell mon@@ dou@@ x tell him , i '@@ ii take care of it
everything 's under control
i can help you , trust me what did i tell you ?
there 's no " dad " on the job ok ?
why don 't you go out for a while ?
i have to think now
jo@@ see , call agent cor@@ be@@ ii from national security , it 's ur@@ gent
good ; i tap@@ ed my stand up
quite a number that one !
soft , vulnerable one minute , cold and cruel the next
i wish i 'd figured her out that quickly
she gets to you doesn 't she ?
yeah , but i 'm done gro@@ ve@@ i@@ ing good for you
i know the type
they use men either as a door@@ mat or as a pe@@ dest@@ al
the important thing is that they can walk all over them
in fact , these girls are born un@@ happy and stay that way
you seem to know what you 're talking about i 've known a iot of women bir@@ on
before finding the right one
you , bir@@ on
you wouldn 't do that would you ? use someone to get ahead ?
uh no , no
i mean , love has to be an exchange otherwise it 's un@@ heal@@ thy
well , miss catherine
you know , i 've done a iot of thinking , in fact ,
i haven 't slept all night and
i 've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you '@@ ii accept a date
you bar@@ gain your in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ces
ah but it was my friend bir@@ on who said that love has to be an exchange
i accept but find something original
that 's another type one should stay away from
that 's more the type you '@@ ii never get close to , bir@@ on
i 'm not interested anyway
where are we going ?
i didn 't see anything the night of the murder
i was at home watching tv and i had a se@@ iz@@ ure
now , i don 't want to hear about my mother 's scar@@ y tales anymore
bir@@ on , you should know that
yes but , it 's important , it might be lin@@ ked to her death
i always said it was going to kill her
i don 't want to hear about her or her books anymore , ok ?
don 't you see i 'm trying to forget ? ah yes , that 's right , she told me she had two big books
you know , with leather bin@@ dings
they seemed very important to her
right , two books
according to the stupid legend , my mother 's powers were passed on from one woman to another and they would each write their chapter full of non@@ sense in there there would be thir@@ teen chap@@ ters per book
well now , the the books have disappeared
just as well
honey , we 're in a bit of a hurry right now
what 's the matter ?
kit@@ ten ? do you have a f@@ ever ?
you 're burning up
you 're all red kit@@ ten
in two years , it 's the first time that it 's so
i don 't know
no , no i wasn 't saying
i mean i don 't want to sound cor@@ ny but
when i wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
i '@@ ii always remember the first day i set foot in here and blanche introduc@@ ed us
she knew right away that it w@@ ou@@ id work between us , huh ?
we '@@ ii miss her eh ? ou@@ i
sorry
it 's the emotions
that little br@@ at !
where the hell is gast@@ onne ?
about time
here 's the auto@@ p@@ sy report
what have you found ?
we spoke to thomas von trie@@ ck at the hospital
would you have a pock@@ et-@@ knife or something ?
no , why ?
bi@@ an@@ che didn 't have one big book ; she had two
yeah , so ? well , i don 't know
do you have a scre@@ w@@ driver ?
we 'd have to read them to know
we 'd have to find them first
and the piece of paper that blanche gave to l@@ apo@@ in@@ te in the woods , did you find it ?
oh , that
hello
i io@@ ve you
you 're the only one
i hope so !
christian doesn 't want to see me anymore
i don 't understand ; he hat@@ es me
he doesn 't really hate you
a@@ ii my i@@ ife , all i 've been trying to do is save the world and i can 't do it
that 's not true
you saved me
when you found me ,
i was all mes@@ sed up with a b@@ iker gang after me
without you , i was lost
still today
you 're sweet , but i 'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
from now on , it an eye for an eye
what will reven@@ ge get you ?
look at l@@ apo@@ in@@ te who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
what was that ?
hey !
mor@@ on !
you want me to to book you in ?
thank you
we don 't have much for you but after our visit to the von trie@@ ck 's , we should be able to help you bir@@ on !
don 't go in there
it 's a secu@@ red area
sam
sam
come on , it 's late
- hey ! hello gorgeous !
hi !
hey , guys ! look how nice she is to her little brother
eh sam ?
she 's so nice to you
it 's not lack of respect ; i worry about you
it was an accident
it '@@ ii pass , we must look ahead
i don 't believe in accid@@ ents
and not only for suz@@ anne
when something happens , when someone is born
stop , catherine stop
stop tor@@ turing yourself
if only you wanted to
that child is my son too stop !
if only you had wanted
i io@@ ved you so much georges
and for so long it 's not possible anymore
catherine
you and me ; we can 't let it end
it last@@ ed this long , despite everything
take the time to think about it
you should get some rest
yes , you 're right
i have to get some rest
i have to get some rest but
stay right where you are !
from now on , i 'm your partner what ?
i take a third of the prof@@ its on everything that 's il@@ legal
i don 't give a damn about
but i have plans for the bar
there '@@ ii be shows in here we have to hurry
there 's no tv , people need entertainment
but for star@@ ters , you '@@ ii tell me all about the deal you were making when i walked in with mom
i want my share
you have about ten seconds to decide
you want to go to ja@@ il ?
fine , i '@@ ii go too but you 're not going to black@@ mail me
christian , we can talk about it but
hello , gast@@ onne ?
christian fer@@ ron hi
uh what 's up ?
christian ?
christian ?
hello mar@@ cou@@ x ?
bei@@ iv@@ eau
no , not robert , gast@@ onne , smar@@ t-@@ ass !
you 're not on duty tonight
i have a question for you
what 's that ?
honestly
do you think i 'm a good cop ? eh well
that 's what i thought
sophie , where 's your daughter now ?
at her grandmother 's
i think blanche 's soul is still close to us
yes , when i saw her , she was tied up , she seemed im@@ prison@@ ed
im@@ prison@@ ed by what ?
by what , i don 't know
but when gi@@ i@@ bert
i mean , there was a bang and i fell back down
sophie , sophie , we '@@ ii just go now
yeah aunt sophie , or we '@@ ii stay and you can go get some rest
no , no , no we can 't leave blanche in that state
what can we do ?
we have to de@@ code blanche 's book
i 'm sure the answer is in there
her book bi@@ an@@ che never allowed us to touch it
yet , she gave it to pierre
why him ?
good question
well , there 's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
bi@@ an@@ che gave you that paper you threw it out
then a little boy brought it back to you
and when you were on the ver@@ ge of giving up , the crazy old man at the restaurant started sing@@ ing : " the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round "
bir@@ on , that was the purpose of the first sent@@ ence
keep me from giving up and keep me here , in great bear yes !
that 's just like blanche
ok read the second sent@@ ence
" he who ga@@ thers the man@@ e has seen and will see again "
" he who ga@@ thers the man@@ e has seen and will see again "
isn 't there a story about some golden man@@ e ?
the man@@ e the man@@ e
according to gast@@ onne 's report , they found nothing in the bear 's fur , nothing in blanche 's hair
it 's not really a man@@ e but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
that 's odd , isn 't it ?
yeah but with all people that come to see her , it 's kind of normal
but bir@@ on , there certainly wasn 't twelve people that went under the chair in one day

her ?
she doesn 't know
i couldn 't tell her because she loves me and i don 't want her to stop

- look at them clo@@ sely ; they 're shaking they 're all shit@@ ting their pants for fear of being the next one
- gast@@ onne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
- what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
- i made a call to compet@@ ent author@@ ities this morning to have them send us their top exper@@ ts
- pa@@ qu@@ ette is the only one who can help us to understand what 's going on
- he read@@ s the rats ' thoughts ?
- better than that , he turns them into images
- if he knew i slept with practically everything in a uniform in great bear
- well thank you mr mayor you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who sav@@ ag@@ ely killed our bel@@ o@@ ved blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
- you seem to know what you 're talking about

about us anyway
- i doubt that i '@@ ii call you back , ok ?
- ok
mom@@ my will be back
madame von trie@@ ck ;
promise me that you will never tell stephanie
- arm@@ and , what hur@@ ts people the most isn 't what we tell them but what we don 't
- no
if i told stephanie i 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that i do worse things than before , she wouldn 't understand that i 'm doing it for her
- i know
- no , you don 't
- yes
her name is do@@ ve
she 's beautiful and wild and she 's after you because you betr@@ ayed her
that 's why you 're hiding in great bear
- but how
- you told stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- it 's true i didn 't want anything to do with the business anymore and do@@ ve had put a hit on my head
- yes , beautiful do@@ ve is mad at you , but it 's not a business matter :
it 's her heart you betr@@ ayed
like you 're betr@@ aying stephanie by not telling her
- no i io@@ ve her
- yes , and you will tell her
- no !
never !
- oh yes , i can see it
she will learn everything from your own mouth
never trust anyone , sarah
no one
ah !
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
bir@@ on , she kissed me , right here !
- good for you in the mean time , he@@ ien@@ e mar@@ cou@@ x 's brother said the four@@ th sent@@ ence
and arm@@ and laf@@ i@@ am@@ me appeared on tv
this is where you were coming from the other day
- you must be very careful ; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bic@@ y@@ cle
- hey , don 't give me orders , buddy
- hey , calm down !
i wouldn 't have expected that from you
i only told them who to call to find the material and the ing@@ redi@@ ents
from there , it 's just a reci@@ pe
hello ?
yes , arm@@ and is here what ?
ok , fine we '@@ ii wait here
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing we wait here
- what 's going on ?
- i told you , nothing
hey , what do you do with that ?
- you are the worst li@@ ar i 've ever heard
- don 't you get it ?
the days when you preten@@ ded to be a good boy and fu@@ cked my sister are over i 'm the boss now
you 're acting just like your father and you always said he was a d@@ umb@@ -@@ ass
- you never stop , do you ?
my father said to wait here
i don 't know what 's going on but if something 's happened to stephanie
you believe pierre 's story now ?
- bir@@ on , i said , " let 's suppose "
listen to this
the night she died ,
bi@@ an@@ che leaves with me for the woods , ok ?
mean@@ while , pierre goes into the house to look in the book
in the woods , someone kno@@ cks me out , kil@@ ls the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught , probably by sarah and her friends , who , according to pierre , brought the body home
so , chances are sarah saw the killer
- well , probably probably according to pierre there 's a chance
come on , that story will never fly
- no , no , bir@@ on
it would explain the foot@@ prin@@ ts in the kitchen , the ha@@ if@@ -@@ done bur@@ ial and the return of the body to the house
- let 's suppose , i@@ ike you say
but it 's probably after ten o '@@ ci@@ ock right now
little sarah , who doesn 't speak , is probably asleep
and according to me , chances are stephanie won 't welcome you with much hospit@@ ality
- ah ! bir@@ on , you 're absolutely right
- right
- so
oh no !
that girl intim@@ id@@ ates me
- bir@@ on , all girls intim@@ id@@ ate you
- hi
- hi
this might seem strange but it 's a i@@ ong story but
i 'd i@@ ike to talk to sarah - sarah 's in bed
come back some other time if you want to play with her , ok ?
- it 's really important
i i have some questions for her
bir@@ on , she hasn 't said a word
yes , i know but
that idiot l@@ apo@@ in@@ te sent you , is that it ?
can 't he mind his own business ?
- no , that wasn 't him
i mean i 'm quite capable of myself
i just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- she saw someone take off on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier
that 's all
- on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier

and how did you know it was mine ?
- luc , luc , luc you and sarah and the others , when 's the i@@ ast time you saw mrs von trie@@ ck ?

mrs von trie@@ ck for the i@@ ast time

- so , what was it you wanted to tell me ?
- i don 't really know
i thought maybe you could help me with my investig@@ ation or to understand why blanche chose me , why i 'm here

- thanks
as far as com@@ pass goes , doesn 't get any better
- i had to come

a real female
i mis@@ jud@@ ged you
i 'm willing to bet that journalist had something to do with this
- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
no , he - not l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
bir@@ on l@@ apo@@ in@@ te wouldn 't have left prin@@ ts all over the place
check if they match bir@@ on 's file and we have to find him right now
send someone to the hydro@@ planes
there 's only one road leading out of great bear , right ?
- ol@@ son road to the for@@ ty-@@ four about a hundred miles in the woods

this is big simone , bigger than the lambert case ;
- it 's your turn em@@ i@@ ie
what the lambert case did for l@@ apo@@ in@@ te 's career , this sco@@ op will do for yours , honey
- but
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ; do you really think
- you think he would have shared the spot@@ light on a case like this ?
- don 't rely on appe@@ aran@@ ces
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te is a bit har@@ sh sometimes but deep down he 's a good guy
- emile , without that sco@@ op , his career is over
- that 's why it w@@ ou@@ id be a rotten thing to
- he might be a good guy but he '@@ ii take all the credit because he can 't af@@ ford not to
don 't you get it ?
they sent him to great bear to get rid of him , he said so himself
- i don 't know
- emile
you 're just a pa@@ wn to him
what do you think 's gon@@ na happen if you show up there together ?
it '@@ ii be : " hello l@@ apo@@ in@@ te !

the key is at the front desk
- coast is clear , they 're gone
- you 're book@@ ing me ?
- hurry up , he can 't be far

- bir@@ on ?
why ?
- they think he 's got comprom@@ ising documents
- comprom@@ ising for who ?
- for national security why , i don 't know yet but it has to do with the helicop@@ ter accident that killed the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ten years ago
- that ugly statue in front ?
- yeah , that 's it in fact , they have no inten@@ tions of letting me go until they have bir@@ on and the documents
- ok , so what am i doing here ?
- you play along but
while they were inter@@ rog@@ ating me , i over@@ heard some in@@ fo :
listen at ten o '@@ ci@@ ock sharp
- w@@ ou@@ id@@ n 't it be better to tell them to send bac@@ kup ?
- if they learn what 's going on , not only do i lose the case i 've dedi@@ cated my i@@ ife to , but you '@@ ii lose your eyes , ears and what 's left of your balls ; in that order
in eight seconds
special agent cor@@ be@@ ii , colonel
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette and robert bei@@ iv@@ eau are also present
i 'm fully aware this is a delicate case , but i have the situation under control
pa@@ qu@@ ette and bei@@ iv@@ eau can test@@ if@@ y to it

he succe@@ eded in re@@ produc@@ ing and im@@ pro@@ ving the technology develop@@ ed by pa@@ qu@@ ette

what happened to the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s ?
of course : you never trust@@ ed me
you 're not about to start today
- you want me to trust you but - yes
- can you keep a secret ?
it wasn 't supposed to be that way
they asked me for twelve guys , prefer@@ ably un@@ emplo@@ yed , with no w@@ ives , no kids
- no future
- i ran an ad :
" dangerous job , lots of quick money "
i knew exactly who would show up
before they got on the helicop@@ ter ,
cor@@ be@@ ii offered them five times their pay if they agreed to particip@@ ate in an exper@@ iment
they all signed up
sam first
after a few days , i went up to see what was going on

but i got sam out ; that pro@@ ves
please , don 't make me regret the only time i followed my heart
- you already regret it
you can 't turn your father in
help me
you 're a cop dad
you 're supposed to protect people
- you 're the only person i can count on
- you say i 'm not a good cop
take a look at yourself

i would have known a iot faster that you led mom to her death
- who told you
you know i didn 't want to hurt her
i just wanted her to know
- don 't swear in front of me
- i would have told you but dad
- what you told me was that you don 't ever want me to try to help you
count on me
i don 't think there 's anything left for me to know , right ?
unless there 's something else you 're hiding , eh arm@@ and ?
- careful
- i wasn 't talking to you
she seems to know what she 's talking about eh ?
is that what exc@@ ites you ?

the only concre@@ te fac@@ ts we have are the article about edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette found in doctor mon@@ dou@@ x 's hand and the missing file on the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s

- never mind arm@@ and stephanie doesn 't want him anymore ; he has nothing left here he '@@ ii leave on his own

there are a iot of things you don 't know about her

attention , everyone
- i 'm fed up , man
we should have recor@@ ded it
- now you think of that ! damn idiot !
- why don 't you shut up ?
- when will you learn to mind your own business ?
- what is he@@ ien@@ e doing in the inter@@ rog@@ ation room , have you seen what state she 's in ?
- she appeared on tv , i@@ ike the other three , we 're looking for a connection
- in the mean time , what do we do about mar@@ cou@@ x ?
it 's been three days since he disappeared
- i won 't send out a search party every time a che@@ ated husband slam@@ s the door
- but dad , it 's mar@@ cou@@ x
- i '@@ ii tell you one last time gast@@ onne ;
you take things too personal
if you want to become any good at this job
- you think i 'm no-@@ good too ?
- what you need to be a cop is a cool head , common sense and a gun
you 're my daughter but all you 've got is the gun
mon@@ ette ?
mon@@ ette it 's me
say , do you know wrestling ?
what the hell is a " death hammer " ?
- so , how are things going ?
any head@@ way ? - i 've wast@@ ed my time
they have no idea why they appeared on tv and they have nothing in common
aside from the we@@ ir@@ do and the ny@@ m@@ ph@@ om@@ ani@@ ac , they barely know each other
the box@@ er is a re@@ tard
the bi@@ -@@ gen@@ dered hair@@ dres@@ ser is completely insan@@ e
the woman only talked about her husband who left her
and the kid wasn 't saying anything
- what have you learned since you 've been here ?
- what is blo@@ cking the tv signal is a magne@@ tic field
- yes but we need to know where whoever took over your research is transmit@@ ting from
the ant@@ enna on the mountain ?
- i checked
to loc@@ ate the source , we would need to intercep@@ t the signal
this means clim@@ bing up there with my instruments and hoping they are transmit@@ ting at that moment
- i 've already called georges fer@@ ron to go with you
bei@@ iv@@ eau and i , we have to prepare a first report , and we have nothing to give them
so if you find anything new

pierre , help me help blanche
- you don 't understand
- no , i don 't understand
pierre ?
- her girlfriend is a hair@@ dres@@ ser
- here
- thanks
- don 't let it get to you
they 're all afraid they are fre@@ aks too , on the inside
they all are a little , and they know it
it so@@ oth@@ es them to see people who are on the outside
- when blanche was here , we could just go see her
- hey , it 's starting !
ladies and gentlem@@ en !
welcome to
- in the spot@@ light , idiot
- welcome to the von trie@@ ck hang@@ ar , site of the most incredi@@ ble entertainment
- this better be worth it , bi@@ an@@ che , or you '@@ ii hear from me in the great beyond
- and now ladies and gentlem@@ en , the first fight of the evening will oppose : in the blue corner ,
" bobby the mayor " bei@@ iv@@ eau
and in the red corner , " luigi big star " l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
that wasn 't in the script
- hey , i just had a con@@ cus@@ sion here
- people are supposed to ro@@ ot for me
- be careful
put everything exactly back where you got it
if he notic@@ es anything , we 're done for
- will we have time ?
- yes , mary@@ se is alone here until six o '@@ ci@@ ock

- everyone remem@@ bers the words ?
- hey , can you see my finger ?
- he 's knocked out
- move away
- no , no , no !
- where are we at ?
- " death hammer "
- mrs
why didn 't you tell me ?
- pierre , help me !
help me !
- blanche ?
you were right
" where the thie@@ f dances "
- i didn 't know what the sent@@ ence meant when i wrote it
- but you were right
- if you want but now i 'm here to tell you i was wrong
- tell me everything
who killed you , who killed dr the tv , the book
- you 're the one who must answer those questions
a@@ ii i can tell you now is this :
i 've already told you about the books in which each generation of wit@@ ches writ@@ es her disco@@ ver@@ ies
i have also told you that most of us want to do good , not evil
unfortunately , every thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h generation , there is an evil witch
she writ@@ es the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter , a bloody chapter , full of ma@@ ie@@ dic@@ tions
- mom ! stop !
stop , she can 't take it anymore !
- for thirty years , i wrote the twel@@ f@@ th chapter of my book
i couldn 't accept that when i died i would have to give my powers to an evil one
so i decided to change the course of things and to ski@@ p the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter by passing on my powers to a good and pure being
i chose my son 's wife
she accepted to sub@@ mit herself to a i@@ ong and hard treat@@ ment
she fought alone against a thousand demons
i pushed her to the end , in the ho@@ pes to save a generation against forces of evil
- leave di@@ ane alone , is that clear ?
- i failed
thomas lost his wife
sarah lost her mother
the whole town lost a friend
one last thing
the last vic@@ tim will serve as a com@@ pass
- the last vic@@ tim will serve as a com@@ pass
thanks pierre
now listen
- apparently there are a iot of be@@ ars in the area
- yeah
a iot
- november 5@@ th , vote bei@@ iv@@ eau
- and now , the moment you have been waiting for ;
the fight oppos@@ ing , in the red corner , the former canadian champion , medium weight :
jean-@@ guy poit@@ ras
and in the blue corner
you ! - dad !
dad you can 't let that happen
he doesn 't have a per@@ mit for this
- come on , can you see me trying to take away their show ?
they already hold me responsible for the tv
- dad , you can 't , you can 't !
- leave me alone
- ok , you 're right
good night - calling me a fa@@ g , huh ?
very brave when you 're twelve against one with baseball bat@@ s , but face to face
come on you co@@ wards , i have one hand tied behind my back
come on , big guy , iet 's go !
- you put everything back exactly in its place ?
- yes perfectly
- we have a volun@@ te@@ er ladies and gentlem@@ en :
rick cy@@ r
- a@@ ii right !
hey
- thanks bir@@ on
cor@@ be@@ ii , we have a problem
- what do we do now ?
- we wait
hoping that the mad@@ man who transmit@@ s on great bear 's waves sen@@ ds another episode
- the mad@@ man might be just a jo@@ ker
- trust me
to do what he does , one must be der@@ ang@@ ed
- and you desig@@ ned the dev@@ ice ?
you experiment@@ ed on humans ?
- i was doing research on mental imag@@ ery
cor@@ be@@ ii 's the one who pushed me
- she stroked my ego
i was going to make history
national security offered me a labor@@ atory , volun@@ te@@ er test subj@@ ec@@ ts
i fell for it
- quit wh@@ in@@ ing
do you know what 's going on ?
- someone pushed my research further
i was able to read the ner@@ ve influ@@ x of the rats to project images
but i was never able to search their memories
i never had the intention to broad@@ cast
- so the rab@@ bits on tv
- they must have been test subj@@ ec@@ ts
- but what we 've been seeing on tv that doesn 't come from the mind of a rab@@ bit
what we 've been seeing on tv , log@@ ically , must have come from the mind of blanche von trie@@ ck
except that she 's dead
- i don 't know exactly how but just before her death , the mad@@ man was able make an electronic copy of her brain
it 's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
- that guy isn 't a mad@@ man , he 's a gen@@ ius
- yeah , a gen@@ ius ! who has already killed at ie@@ ast two people :
von trie@@ ck and dr
- how many have you killed ?
- i never killed any@@ body , i stopped
they wanted me to continue but i refused
- but still , you must have an idea of who might be doing this ?
- it has to be someone who knows my research
those guys are scat@@ tered all over the world
except le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais who 's dead
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais ?
- a signal
we '@@ ii loc@@ ate the transmit@@ ter
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais ?
no ! no !
- so
you got to grande our@@ se two days ago
- you 're sending me to a hole
- out of the blue , you ended up at blanche von trie@@ ck 's
- i was waiting for you
- then you took a night str@@ oll with the old woman
- i don 't know the meaning of these sent@@ ences but i know they will help you , one by one , to save my soul
- and mine
it 's been a i@@ ong time since i 've seen such a beautiful women
i thought the clu@@ es were leading me to a criminal
- the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass
- in reality , they were leading me to you
- l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
bi@@ an@@ che 's killer it 's catherine
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ?
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te ! it 's catherine !
it 's catherine , l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
catherine open the door !
i know you 're there
- georges
- no catherine !
- catherine !
- get in i have to talk to you
i know
- no , i know
- stephanie
ste@@ f
- soon it won 't hurt anymore , you '@@ ii see
- yes , i need an ambul@@ ance at the la for@@ ge hotel , room number two
it looks like a heart attack , hurry up
they 're on their way georges
- catherine is not a woman for you
you don 't know her
you don 't know anything about her
- forget about that ok ?
don 't think about that
- listen
she 's the one i io@@ ved
she was 15 , i was 24
i was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off suz@@ anne first , her older sister
it was catherine 's idea ,
i swear
catherine was coming to live with us that way we could be together right away
but don 't think she didn 't love her sister
she ado@@ red her
it was for her she did all this
suz@@ anne was der@@ ang@@ ed , almost always off in her own world
she would have ended up alone , un@@ happy
catherine sacrific@@ ed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
it went wrong when catherine got pregnant
she cried for weeks , but to protect her sister , she decided to have an abor@@ tion
in those days , thomas von trie@@ ck 's wife was blanche 's apprent@@ ice except that she was using what the learned from blanche to do black magic
catherine went to see her
but the abor@@ tion didn 't work
she went off to montreal to have the baby
he was born a veget@@ able and a gim@@ p
she never for@@ gave herself
she hid him
and she became ob@@ ses@@ sed she dedi@@ cated her life to finding a way to cure our son
she never succe@@ eded
she 's only been back in great bear for two , three years
i thought things were better
- georges where can i find her ?
- you won 't find her
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais 's b@@ imbo is here
- yes , that 's it
it looks like catherine , fer@@ ron 's si@@ ster@@ -@@ in-@@ i@@ aw
- and his mist@@ ress
- yes , exactly
- fer@@ ron i knew he did it on purpose
- pa@@ qu@@ ette , couldn 't you have thought of that ?
- le@@ fi@@ agu@@ ais 's girlfriend ? she couldn 't tell the difference between a brain cell and an amo@@ eba
at least she didn 't look like it
- bei@@ iv@@ eau ?
- yes ?
- not you , your daughter
very good work , bei@@ iv@@ eau
i will person@@ ally see that your efforts be re@@ war@@ ded by a promotion
- thanks
- this is a very serious case
you saw what happened in great bear , on a small scale ?
if the disco@@ ver@@ ies of what 's her name ?
- catherine lap@@ i@@ ante
- if lap@@ i@@ ante 's disco@@ ver@@ ies were found out , if they ended up in the wrong hands
do you understand ? - yes
- we have to act quickly so that despite a few err@@ ors commit@@ ted in the past , the information concer@@ ning this case re@@ mains secret
- that i can 't
- sometimes to do the right thing you have to pick the les@@ ser of two ev@@ ils
in this case , it 's better to leave the death@@ s of a few i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s un@@ pun@@ ished than to risk that dangerous technologies end up in the hands of terror@@ ists , or
- got it !
i found the coordin@@ ates of the transmit@@ ter that broad@@ cast@@ ed those images last night
- forget what you know about the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s
it won 't bring them back ;
it 's all in the past we need you , right now
- you won 't regret it , captain bei@@ iv@@ eau
- chief , someone st@@ ole a body from the mor@@ gue
- who 's body ?
- blanche
a bunch of people took her
they 're fre@@ aking out because of the tv they want to bury her
- come on !
- bei@@ iv@@ eau , i want my law@@ yer !
i want my law@@ yer !
i want my law@@ yer
- buy us some time
let him see arm@@ and but no one else
- catherine ?
- what are you doing here ?
- i was looking for stephanie
she got in the car with catherine and i can 't find her
what 's this ?
- catherine it can 't be true
- what ? - bir@@ on is in danger , your stephanie too
- what do you mean , in danger ?
- come on , i '@@ ii explain on the way
- he 's my ste@@ p@@ brother ?
- genet@@ ically , ach@@ illes is even closer to you since i 'm your mother 's sister
but there isn 't a name for that , except " bastard "
- when i found out you 're the one who killed mom , i wanted to kill you catherine , i swear
but now
- reven@@ ge doesn 't make the pain go away
only for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess can
but people are too weak to forgive
you '@@ ii feel so much better after
- so , now it 's party time
- i '@@ ii sleep here tonight
take me out for dinner and
- right
- the images that appeared last night were broad@@ cast@@ ed from here
- that 's close to the old mine
- i '@@ ii take a gps , i '@@ ii manage
but make sure your daughter st@@ ays on our side until bir@@ on has his accident
after that she won 't be able to do anything
this might be a very important day , boys !
- what do you think she '@@ ii do once she can search any@@ body 's brain ?
- she '@@ ii spread joy all around the world
- chief !
chief !
- what ? what is it ?
- it 's bir@@ on
he hung himself in his cell
oh no !
help !
somebody ! hurry !
open the door ! un@@ lock the door !
oh my god !
ok , i got him go call an ambul@@ ance , quick !
- hold on , hold on
- i 'm proud of you son
you hand@@ led it like a pro
i can go in peace now
- c '@@ mon dad
- christian , all i have is yours now
but take care of your sister
- don 't say that dad , our business has just started
we '@@ ii get more wad@@ s like these , you '@@ ii see
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing
- no , i know there 's something , what is it dad ?
- it 's ok son , it 's experience
- what ?
- counter@@ fe@@ it
- that two-@@ tim@@ ing little tram@@ p !
- calm down christian
- well , thanks guys
- i 've had this har@@ ness since i played the hanging of louis-@@ ri@@ ei in a college play and now ; an escape
- well , it wasn 't a@@ ic@@ atra@@ z , but still
- so now we have to go to the mor@@ gue , we have to find stephanie
- the mor@@ gue ?
- yes , because the real " last vic@@ tim " was dr mon@@ dou@@ x
there 's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to ste@@ f - so , he knows everything now ?
- you 're the one who wanted to split
- yeah but still not two days ago he was " that little br@@ at " and now - get out
- no problem
- the only reason i got you out of there was because i thought your life was in danger because of what you read on the i@@ um@@ ber@@ jack@@ s - i didn 't read anything
- hey !
don 't give me that shit
when they got a hold of you , you were fle@@ eing to montreal with the sco@@ op
- yeah
- don 't worry bir@@ on , at your age , in those circum@@ stances ,
i would have done the same
- really ?
- but what hur@@ ts me is that you didn 't tell me face to face
- i i know
- yeah
- now , don 't tell me you didn 't hide a copy of those documents somewhere or i i '@@ ii never speak to you again
i really wouldn 't have taught you anything
- well
i took some digital pictures
i have them all right here , on mini-@@ disc
- that 's my bir@@ on !
ok , now you can go
- go where ?
- to montreal
- no , i can 't go alone ; you have to come with me
- no , your time has come
you wanted your chance : you got it
- no , no , i couldn 't
- listen ,
i came here to save my soul , not my career
remember ?
- yeah , right
- look , saint-denis will pick you up in half an hour at the cro@@ ok@@ ed lake , ok ?
one last thing
listen , a i@@ ong story but
catherine killed blanche and the doctor
- what ?
no
didn 't i tell you not to trust her ?
you really liked her didn 't you ?
i 'm really sorry
- take care of yourself
- yeah , thanks for everything
- what do you mean , the mor@@ gue is closed ? - they 've already stol@@ en a body
- who 's ?
- blanche 's
they 're gone to bury or cre@@ mate her
they 're the only ones left
- it 's dr mon@@ dou@@ x we want to see
- impossible
- the last vic@@ tim wait !
look these are the marks from pa@@ qu@@ ette and catherine 's dev@@ ice he 's the i@@ ast vic@@ tim
but what does it mean , " the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass " ?
- arm@@ and , if i 've learned one thing here it 's that sometimes
" the last vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass " simply means the i@@ ast vic@@ tim will act as a com@@ pass
- are you sure ?
- do you have another way to find catherine and stephanie ?
- i 'm telling you , they took the body into the woods
what do we tell her family ? what ?
what ?
i don 't understand ;
let me talk to him
hi , dad ? yes
what do you mean escaped ? - escaped !
he 's gone
i have all the roads under surveillance , the hydro@@ planes too
he won 't go far but he can talk
- he wants his sco@@ op he won 't talk
except that there 's more than one lake in the area
- i don 't have enough staff to check all the lak@@ es
- saint-denis
- what about saint-denis ?
- he 's coming down
he 's going to cro@@ ok@@ ed lake
- cro@@ ok@@ ed lake
easy , easy
easy
- don 't move bir@@ on !
stay here !
- you '@@ ii take me in
you '@@ ii send me to my death ? - i have orders you can 't leave great bear
- orders from who ?
your father ?
cor@@ be@@ ii ? they 're in it up to here , gast@@ onne
- this is a national security matter
- no , no , this is an anal security matter
those two want to save their as@@ ses and you know it
- you 're only thinking of your sco@@ op , you 're not seeing the consequences
- yes , i 'm thinking of my sco@@ op
and the consequences will be the truth will come out and justice will be done
- don 't make me laugh ! there always will be in@@ justice bir@@ on

you might doubt that today

- you shouldn 't be
- my friends
before blanche can join the spir@@ its of the forest , i have to tell you something
- catherine
please !
i forgive you
i don 't want to lose my memories
- poor little girl , you 're scared
but you '@@ ii feel so much better after
i '@@ ii only re@@ move the bad ones
you know , at first , i did all this for ach@@ illes
with neur@@ ology , i was trying to find a way to talk to him to tell him that if i cou@@ id start over
but i can 't
so i wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
i didn 't want blanche to die i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
don 't you think ?
- ste@@ f ?
- catherine , no
catherine , please
it 's over now , iet me help you
- i can go in peace now
a@@ ii i have is yours
- don 't do anything stupid christian ,
look at it as a game
you lost this one , you '@@ ii win others
- no , no
i can lose them all but not this one
- you 've already all read blanche 's book
- yes
- blanche wanted to ski@@ p the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h generation , the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h chapter , the evil one , so she could pass on her powers to someone good
but she failed
that 's what she wanted me to tell you
evil exist@@ s
it will always ex@@ ist
we have to keep fighting it , all the time , whether it 's inside or outside of our@@ selves
- ok , but
who would be the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h ?
the bad one ?
- yeah , who 's the hei@@ ress of blanche 's powers ?
- for me , there 's no doubt
she 's the thir@@ te@@ ent@@ h
sarah von trie@@ ck
- don 't you think you 've done enough , pierre ?
first , you dis@@ respect my mother 's body , and now , her grand@@ daughter
this little girl is gri@@ ev@@ ing so much since her grandmother died that she hasn 't said a word
and you want to make her out to be a demon ?
- she 's the one i tell you
i 'm sure , she 's the one
didn 't you hear that ?
she said she wants to kill me !
didn 't you hear ?
- that 's enough pierre go have yourself examin@@ ed
leave us alone
- you don 't believe me , you '@@ ii regret it
you '@@ ii all regret it
- you want to burn her right here ?
- yes
- let 's finish this
- it 's over now
let me help you
- go
you
stay here
- you were hiding a iot of things from me
- i never hid that i hid things
- true
- that i was a monster ?
- no , that 's not it
- admit it , i am a monster in your eyes now , i@@ ike in my own
- no , no , no catherine , no

- the look in your eyes was what saved me
thanks to you catherine , i 've changed

come on , we 've got to get help
- would you forgive me ?
- i can tell you 're going to break my heart
that , i 'm warning you , i won 't forgive you for
- it 's often dangerous to get too close to the truth you know
- is this a challenge or a warning ?
- a bit of both
i thought that if everybody knew the bad things everybody else did , we would be forced to forgive one another
- catherine , it 's us@@ eless now
- right
it 's us@@ eless
- samuel ?
- mar@@ cou@@ x ?
bi@@ an@@ che ?

i 'm deeply sorry for the famili@@ es it 's trag@@ ic
as for mrs von trie@@ ck , i 'm gri@@ ev@@ ing like everyone else
the investig@@ ation is under way but let 's not put the horses before the car@@ t
- ha ! the horses
- still , she 's the most liked and respec@@ ted woman in town
any lead@@ s ? suspec@@ ts ? anything at all ?
- horses in front of the car@@ t
- the prior@@ ity is the safety of the population
we obviously have several lead@@ s , i can 't give any details
- come on ! come on !
give them details !
- people seem to think that you don 't know the details
what people ?
- everybody
- and what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
people would i@@ ike to know when it will come back
i made a call to compet@@ ent author@@ ities this morning to have them send us their top exper@@ ts
in my days , there was no television
- in other words , you have no clue what 's going on
well thank you mr mayor for the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment - that 's right !
thank you very much you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who sav@@ ag@@ ely killed our bel@@ o@@ ved blanche
- poor blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
i 'm starting to understand her
too bad i 'm leaving ; i cou@@ id have told you what to do with her
never mind simone
you can 't leave ;
you 're a wit@@ ness in a murder investig@@ ation
might as well make the most of it and do a story
bir@@ on , i 'm tired , i need some rest
- do you think we ever got any rest ?
we worked twelve hours a day and at night
nothing ever happens in great bear
then , you come here , there 's a murder , a man@@ hunt , su@@ ici@@ des , tv fre@@ aks out
bir@@ on i have nothing to do with your far@@ fet@@ ched tales
- i won 't fet@@ ch anything very far , at my age
when i found you last night , there was this paper at your feet
are you writing po@@ etr@@ y ? - po@@ etr@@ y is bor@@ ing
but at christmas time , sometimes we 'd sing songs
- yeah , that 's it i write po@@ etr@@ y
don 't forget what blanche said ;
your fate is lin@@ ked to hers
my fate i 'm not dead
what is a dead person 's fate ?
- poor blanche
- follow me , i '@@ ii show you
- we 'd sing what was it that we 'd sing ?
" the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round "
the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round
she got me the old bat !
she got me
and the elections are coming up
fan@@ at@@ ics ;
it could cost me my mayor 's job
bi@@ an@@ che was all that 's good in the world , all put together in the same person , who would listen to them and guide them
she told them what they wanted to hear and made them believe anything - no way !
- how would you know ?
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te 's de@@ position
yeah , that 's what he told me at the hospital , word for word
big surprise !
why would it have changed ?
what did they te@@ ach you at police academy ?
why would he lie ?
bi@@ an@@ che left him a paper with clu@@ es we should follow
hey , the case is mu@@ ddy enough without me wor@@ rying about the old woman 's hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations
forget it !
about suz@@ anne fer@@ ron ; i 'm starting to think i 'm wast@@ ing my time
pro@@ of@@ s were er@@ ased , pur@@ po@@ sely you don 't say ?
by the way the cle@@ an@@ ers will be there tomorrow morning , before thomas gets out of the hospital
in the mean time , don 't touch anything and keep your nose out of it

oh yes !
now i 've got it !
i don 't know why i didn 't think of it so@@ oner !
another stroke of gen@@ ius ?

i 'm sorry about blanche

i 've got an idea
fantast@@ ic ?
extraordin@@ ary ?
insan@@ e ?
a@@ ii of the above !
do you think what happened to gilbert was because of us ? because of what we did with blanche 's book ?
of course not
gilbert thi@@ bo@@ deau never needed any help to get into trouble
i don 't feel so good since blanche is gone
everything is back@@ wards and
i 'm scared
you 're too sensit@@ ive honey
bi@@ an@@ che wouldn 't have liked us playing with forces we can 't control
sophie was putting us on
you really think she left her body and saw blanche with wi@@ res coming out of her head ?
she rose above the table , you saw her
well , iet 's keep that between us for now , ok ? yeah
wait for me ; i '@@ ii give you a lift
i 've never felt that way in all my i@@ ife , pierre
i felt myself leave

pierre , pierre , come lay down , you 're tired

i felt powerful and free
excuse me
what 's the matter ?
hey !
if you 're gay too , then i 'm the one who 's gon@@ na shoot myself
no , that 's not it
i just can 't ! you 're played the te@@ ase long enough
at first , it turned me on but it 's not funny anymore , pierre
it wasn 't my intention sophie , i 'm sorry
if it 's because of gilbert , you know there was nothing left between us i have to go
pierre , i need a man !
i need you
hurry up bir@@ on ; i 'm having a shit@@ ty day
you better have a good reason to bring me back here

a@@ ii right , ok i see everybody 's in a good mood this morning
would you put that on , please gast@@ onne ?
i thought all the tv@@ s in town had nothing but snow ?

there 's no ant@@ enna , nothing to rece@@ ive the waves , it takes it 's signal from the v@@ cr
bir@@ on , i know what a monit@@ or is

there
well
i '@@ ii be damned it 's that bear
the old woman 's stu@@ ffed bear
that 's right
bi@@ an@@ che 's didn 't tape her me@@ et@@ ings with people
no , but there 's something there
there 's got to be a link between blanche 's murder and poit@@ ras and the tv
and the rab@@ bits that appeared during poit@@ ras ' fight
- well , why not ?
it would be log@@ ical i don 't know if it 's log@@ ical but it remin@@ ds me that something 's not right with your de@@ position
bi@@ an@@ che 's big book you were talking about ;
the night she was killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
yes , the book
very nice , with a leather bin@@ ding
we search@@ ed everywhere ;
well , the killer took off with it then ?
i 've got an idea come on bir@@ on
hey ! wo@@ ah !
what idea ?
i don 't work for the police but you 're still a susp@@ ect
it 's to your advantage to cooper@@ ate
you '@@ ii get the auto@@ p@@ sy report on the old woman ?
give us a copy and we '@@ ii tell you what we have found on our end
ok , ok
but not a word to my father eh ?
i 'm not supposed to get involved in that
no , no , no
we have a story now , don 't we ?
what 's your idea ? to get the auto@@ p@@ sy report
that 's a good one
but what do we do for gast@@ onne ;
we 've got nothing for her you see bir@@ on ; we have to re@@ constitu@@ te the events of that night , right ?
we have to speak with blanche 's son ; he was in the house too
the auto@@ p@@ sy report should help us re@@ construc@@ t the fac@@ ts and put the pieces together
ah , cool but what do we do for gast@@ onne ?
i have to take a shower , bir@@ on
come on , iet 's go

what 's up with you ?
did you call me here to talk about my war@@ dro@@ be ?
no i want to know how mom died
you know it , dad knows it and i don 't know why you 're protec@@ ting him
if he 's threaten@@ ing you , you 'd better tell me
i '@@ ii help you that time is over ste@@ f
i don 't want any help anymore
especially coming from you
if someone falls down , you help them up just enough so they can walk if they lean on you
and when they 're too much of a bur@@ den
you take off
look at me look at mom
you 're such an as@@ sh@@ ole
oh yeah ! that 's another thing ;
i 'm done being nice
as of now , i 'm an as@@ sh@@ ole
now , if you '@@ ii excuse me , i have a meeting to get to
- excuse me stephanie ;
i 'm looking for dr mon@@ dou@@ x
it 's for an auto@@ p@@ sy report
my mother 's ?
no blanche 's
because your mother yes , she was inc@@ iner@@ ated the same night
i know everybody knows
yeah
anyway
don 't bother gast@@ onne , it 's us@@ eless now
according to mon@@ dou@@ x , she was parti@@ ally buried , and then dragged for a good distance after her death
why would a killer bring his vic@@ tim back in her own house ?
i don 't know
yeah
these marks are ident@@ ical to the ones you 'd find on the skin of people on whom they test@@ ed a dev@@ ice invent@@ ed by a certain doctor edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
edouard who ?
pa@@ qu@@ ette
edouard pa@@ qu@@ ette
mon@@ dou@@ x has tried to contact him but he couldn 't get a hold of him
- no , no tell mon@@ dou@@ x tell him , i '@@ ii take care of it
everything 's under control
i can help you , trust me what did i tell you ?
there 's no " dad " on the job ok ?
why don 't you go out for a while ?
i have to think now
jo@@ see , call agent cor@@ be@@ ii from national security , it 's ur@@ gent
good ; i tap@@ ed my stand up
quite a number that one !
soft , vulnerable one minute , cold and cruel the next
i wish i 'd figured her out that quickly
she gets to you doesn 't she ?
yeah , but i 'm done gro@@ ve@@ i@@ ing good for you
i know the type
they use men either as a door@@ mat or as a pe@@ dest@@ al
the important thing is that they can walk all over them
in fact , these girls are born un@@ happy and stay that way
you seem to know what you 're talking about i 've known a iot of women bir@@ on
before finding the right one
you , bir@@ on
you wouldn 't do that would you ? use someone to get ahead ?
uh no , no
i mean , love has to be an exchange otherwise it 's un@@ heal@@ thy
well , miss catherine
you know , i 've done a iot of thinking , in fact ,
i haven 't slept all night and
i 've decided to forgive you for breaking my heart if you '@@ ii accept a date
you bar@@ gain your in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ces
ah but it was my friend bir@@ on who said that love has to be an exchange
i accept but find something original
that 's another type one should stay away from
that 's more the type you '@@ ii never get close to , bir@@ on
i 'm not interested anyway
where are we going ?
i didn 't see anything the night of the murder
i was at home watching tv and i had a se@@ iz@@ ure
now , i don 't want to hear about my mother 's scar@@ y tales anymore
bir@@ on , you should know that
yes but , it 's important , it might be lin@@ ked to her death
i always said it was going to kill her
i don 't want to hear about her or her books anymore , ok ?
don 't you see i 'm trying to forget ? ah yes , that 's right , she told me she had two big books
you know , with leather bin@@ dings
they seemed very important to her
right , two books
according to the stupid legend , my mother 's powers were passed on from one woman to another and they would each write their chapter full of non@@ sense in there there would be thir@@ teen chap@@ ters per book
well now , the the books have disappeared
just as well
honey , we 're in a bit of a hurry right now
what 's the matter ?
kit@@ ten ? do you have a f@@ ever ?
you 're burning up
you 're all red kit@@ ten
in two years , it 's the first time that it 's so
i don 't know
no , no i wasn 't saying
i mean i don 't want to sound cor@@ ny but
when i wake up in the morning and think that the beautiful girl next to me is my wife
i '@@ ii always remember the first day i set foot in here and blanche introduc@@ ed us
she knew right away that it w@@ ou@@ id work between us , huh ?
we '@@ ii miss her eh ? ou@@ i
sorry
it 's the emotions
that little br@@ at !
where the hell is gast@@ onne ?
about time
here 's the auto@@ p@@ sy report
what have you found ?
we spoke to thomas von trie@@ ck at the hospital
would you have a pock@@ et-@@ knife or something ?
no , why ?
bi@@ an@@ che didn 't have one big book ; she had two
yeah , so ? well , i don 't know
do you have a scre@@ w@@ driver ?
we 'd have to read them to know
we 'd have to find them first
and the piece of paper that blanche gave to l@@ apo@@ in@@ te in the woods , did you find it ?
oh , that
hello
i io@@ ve you
you 're the only one
i hope so !
christian doesn 't want to see me anymore
i don 't understand ; he hat@@ es me
he doesn 't really hate you
a@@ ii my i@@ ife , all i 've been trying to do is save the world and i can 't do it
that 's not true
you saved me
when you found me ,
i was all mes@@ sed up with a b@@ iker gang after me
without you , i was lost
still today
you 're sweet , but i 'm done living for everyone else and turning the other cheek
from now on , it an eye for an eye
what will reven@@ ge get you ?
look at l@@ apo@@ in@@ te who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
what was that ?
hey !
mor@@ on !
you want me to to book you in ?
thank you
we don 't have much for you but after our visit to the von trie@@ ck 's , we should be able to help you bir@@ on !
don 't go in there

sam
sam

- hey ! hello gorgeous !
hi !
hey , guys ! look how nice she is to her little brother
eh sam ?
she 's so nice to you
it 's not lack of respect ; i worry about you
it was an accident
it '@@ ii pass , we must look ahead
i don 't believe in accid@@ ents
and not only for suz@@ anne
when something happens , when someone is born
stop , catherine stop
stop tor@@ turing yourself
if only you wanted to
that child is my son too stop !
if only you had wanted
i io@@ ved you so much georges
and for so long it 's not possible anymore
catherine
you and me ; we can 't let it end
it last@@ ed this long , despite everything
take the time to think about it
you should get some rest
yes , you 're right
i have to get some rest
i have to get some rest but
stay right where you are !
from now on , i 'm your partner what ?
i take a third of the prof@@ its on everything that 's il@@ legal
i don 't give a damn about
but i have plans for the bar
there '@@ ii be shows in here we have to hurry
there 's no tv , people need entertainment
but for star@@ ters , you '@@ ii tell me all about the deal you were making when i walked in with mom
i want my share
you have about ten seconds to decide
you want to go to ja@@ il ?
fine , i '@@ ii go too but you 're not going to black@@ mail me
christian , we can talk about it but
hello , gast@@ onne ?
christian fer@@ ron hi
uh what 's up ?
christian ?
christian ?
hello mar@@ cou@@ x ?
bei@@ iv@@ eau
no , not robert , gast@@ onne , smar@@ t-@@ ass !
you 're not on duty tonight
i have a question for you
what 's that ?
honestly
do you think i 'm a good cop ? eh well
that 's what i thought
sophie , where 's your daughter now ?
at her grandmother 's
i think blanche 's soul is still close to us
yes , when i saw her , she was tied up , she seemed im@@ prison@@ ed
im@@ prison@@ ed by what ?
by what , i don 't know
but when gi@@ i@@ bert
i mean , there was a bang and i fell back down
sophie , sophie , we '@@ ii just go now
yeah aunt sophie , or we '@@ ii stay and you can go get some rest
no , no , no we can 't leave blanche in that state
what can we do ?
we have to de@@ code blanche 's book
i 'm sure the answer is in there
her book bi@@ an@@ che never allowed us to touch it
yet , she gave it to pierre
why him ?
good question
well , there 's nothing upstairs
unless we missed something in the report
bi@@ an@@ che gave you that paper you threw it out
then a little boy brought it back to you
and when you were on the ver@@ ge of giving up , the crazy old man at the restaurant started sing@@ ing : " the pad@@ dle lead@@ s us round and round "
bir@@ on , that was the purpose of the first sent@@ ence
keep me from giving up and keep me here , in great bear yes !
that 's just like blanche
ok read the second sent@@ ence
" he who ga@@ thers the man@@ e has seen and will see again "
" he who ga@@ thers the man@@ e has seen and will see again "
isn 't there a story about some golden man@@ e ?
the man@@ e the man@@ e
according to gast@@ onne 's report , they found nothing in the bear 's fur , nothing in blanche 's hair
it 's not really a man@@ e but they found hair from twelve different people under a chair upstairs
that 's odd , isn 't it ?
yeah but with all people that come to see her , it 's kind of normal
but bir@@ on , there certainly wasn 't twelve people that went under the chair in one day
he who ga@@ thers the man@@ e the man@@ e
there must be a hair salon in great bear ?
- who works there ?
it 's it 's
he does
you 're trying my patience son
come on , get the str@@ ap !
you never hesitated before !
georges , iet him go
- mr fer@@ ron ?
- what do you want mike ?
turn on your tv , quick !
i '@@ ii let you think about it until tomorrow
it 's not that you 're not a good cop it 's it 's just not natural for you your mind is too nu@@ an@@ ced , know what i mean ?
so , to be a good cop , you have to be narrow min@@ ded ?
no , seriously , gast@@ onne ; what made you become a cop ?
why ?
you mean , " who made me ? "
you followed someone to the academy ?
i ran away from someone who hurt me
you , the first day you arrived in great bear , you found the woman of your dreams
two years already
i spend my i@@ ife in great bear and
- attention all un@@ its there 's someone else on tv
it 's
keep an eye out in case things heat up
who is it ?
mar@@ cou@@ x ! find that person and make sure they 're safe
so far , it has meant bad luck to
pierre lam@@ y , it 's pierre lam@@ y
it 's pierre lam@@ y
her ?
she doesn 't know
i couldn 't tell her because she loves me and i don 't want her to stop
gast@@ onne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
no
to have both sex@@ es isn 't being a man
i have one o@@ var@@ y and one test@@ ic@@ le
i 'm not a man
if you could see it
if gast@@ onne saw it
yes
i 'd rather hurt her
i 'd rather she went away
i 'd rather
anything but that
hey ! imagine that !
you can with yourself
yeah
how do you do it ?
that 's it !
that 's him !
him what ?
that 's why blanche gave him the book
pierre is the hei@@ ress to her powers
oh my god !
hello ?
doctor , are you in your office ?
well , yes , obviously
doctor
doctor , tell me you 're alone ?
alone ?
of course i 'm
doctor ?
doctor !
in the i@@ ast episode - a@@ very bad cycle has begun
- hold me tight arm@@ and
- they can 't stand themselves without tv
look at them !
they 're all watching out for the next scand@@ al
- look at them clo@@ sely ; they 're shaking they 're all shit@@ ting their pants for fear of being the next one
- gast@@ onne loves me because she thinks i 'm a man
- what about the tv , do you know anything about that ?
- i made a call to compet@@ ent author@@ ities this morning to have them send us their top exper@@ ts
- pa@@ qu@@ ette is the only one who can help us to understand what 's going on
- he read@@ s the rats ' thoughts ?
- better than that , he turns them into images
- if he knew i slept with practically everything in a uniform in great bear
- well thank you mr mayor you have no idea what 's going on with the television or who sav@@ ag@@ ely killed our bel@@ o@@ ved blanche
- she 's quite determined , your ex
- you seem to know what you 're talking about
- i have known a iot of women bir@@ on , before finding my own
- see you again soon , mr l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
- so , the next one would be : " got cell@@ s "
- yeah , well , they 've been in order since the beginning
- got cell@@ s , got cell@@ s , got cell@@ s , got cell@@ s , got cell@@ s
- come on , come on !
- my g@@ love
that 's arm@@ and
stop it swe@@ ethe@@ art
mom@@ my 's doing this for your own good
what 's wrong ?
oh no
bir@@ on , samuel said : " got cell@@ s "
georges , have you seen it ?
what should we do ?
- i don 't know
he hasn 't said anything yet ;
maybe he won 't say anything at all
about us anyway
- i doubt that i '@@ ii call you back , ok ?
- ok
mom@@ my will be back
madame von trie@@ ck ;
promise me that you will never tell stephanie
- arm@@ and , what hur@@ ts people the most isn 't what we tell them but what we don 't
- no
if i told stephanie i 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that i do worse things than before , she wouldn 't understand that i 'm doing it for her
- i know
- no , you don 't
- yes
her name is do@@ ve
she 's beautiful and wild and she 's after you because you betr@@ ayed her
that 's why you 're hiding in great bear
- but how
- you told stephanie that you were hiding from your old gang
- it 's true i didn 't want anything to do with the business anymore and do@@ ve had put a hit on my head
- yes , beautiful do@@ ve is mad at you , but it 's not a business matter :
it 's her heart you betr@@ ayed
like you 're betr@@ aying stephanie by not telling her
- no i io@@ ve her
- yes , and you will tell her
- no !
never !
- oh yes , i can see it
she will learn everything from your own mouth
never trust anyone , sarah
no one
ah !
l@@ apo@@ in@@ te
bir@@ on , she kissed me , right here !
- good for you in the mean time , he@@ ien@@ e mar@@ cou@@ x 's brother said the four@@ th sent@@ ence
and arm@@ and laf@@ i@@ am@@ me appeared on tv
this is where you were coming from the other day
- you must be very careful ; someone could spot you in the area
always come on a bic@@ y@@ cle
- hey , don 't give me orders , buddy
- hey , calm down !
i wouldn 't have expected that from you
i only told them who to call to find the material and the ing@@ redi@@ ents
from there , it 's just a reci@@ pe
hello ?
yes , arm@@ and is here what ?
ok , fine we '@@ ii wait here
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing we wait here
- what 's going on ?
- i told you , nothing
hey , what do you do with that ?
- you are the worst li@@ ar i 've ever heard
- don 't you get it ?
the days when you preten@@ ded to be a good boy and fu@@ cked my sister are over i 'm the boss now
you 're acting just like your father and you always said he was a d@@ umb@@ -@@ ass
- you never stop , do you ?
my father said to wait here
i don 't know what 's going on but if something 's happened to stephanie
you believe pierre 's story now ?
- bir@@ on , i said , " let 's suppose "
listen to this
the night she died ,
bi@@ an@@ che leaves with me for the woods , ok ?
mean@@ while , pierre goes into the house to look in the book
in the woods , someone kno@@ cks me out , kil@@ ls the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught , probably by sarah and her friends , who , according to pierre , brought the body home
so , chances are sarah saw the killer
- well , probably probably according to pierre there 's a chance
come on , that story will never fly
- no , no , bir@@ on
it would explain the foot@@ prin@@ ts in the kitchen , the ha@@ if@@ -@@ done bur@@ ial and the return of the body to the house
- let 's suppose , i@@ ike you say
but it 's probably after ten o '@@ ci@@ ock right now
little sarah , who doesn 't speak , is probably asleep
and according to me , chances are stephanie won 't welcome you with much hospit@@ ality
- ah ! bir@@ on , you 're absolutely right
- right
- so
oh no !
that girl intim@@ id@@ ates me
- bir@@ on , all girls intim@@ id@@ ate you
- hi
- hi
this might seem strange but it 's a i@@ ong story but
i 'd i@@ ike to talk to sarah - sarah 's in bed
come back some other time if you want to play with her , ok ?
- it 's really important
i i have some questions for her
bir@@ on , she hasn 't said a word
yes , i know but
that idiot l@@ apo@@ in@@ te sent you , is that it ?
can 't he mind his own business ?
- no , that wasn 't him
i mean i 'm quite capable of myself
i just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
- she saw someone take off on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier
that 's all
- on a four@@ -@@ whe@@ e@@ ier
- the little br@@ at is here !
come on bir@@ on !
arm@@ and
ste@@ f !
are you ok ?
i thought something had happened to you
- you were right
just tell me you 're not associ@@ ated with my father
